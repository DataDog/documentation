# What is Datadog?

Datadog is an observability platform that supports every phase of software development on any stack. The platform consists of many products that help you build, test, monitor, debug, optimize, and secure your software. These products can be used individually or combined into a customized solution.

## Examples of how you can use Datadog, organized by project phase

### Development

- Highlight code vulnerabilities in your text editor or on GitHub with [Code Security](/security/code_security/).
- Facilitate a remote pair-programming session with [CoScreen](/coscreen/).

### Testing

- Block faulty code from deploying to production with [Quality Gates](/quality_gates/).
- Simulate users around the globe to test your web app, API, or mobile application with [Synthetic Monitoring](/synthetics/).

### Monitoring

- Ingest [logs](/logs/), [metrics](/metrics/), [events](/events/), and [network traces](/tracing/glossary/#trace) with granular control over processing, aggregation, and [alerting](/monitors/).
- Assess host performance with [Continuous Profiler](/profiler/).
- Assess application performance with [Application Performance Monitoring](/tracing/).

### Troubleshooting

- Manage [errors](/error_tracking/) and [incidents](/service_management/incident_management/), summarizing issues and suggesting fixes.
- Measure user churn and detect user frustration with [Real User Monitoring](/real_user_monitoring/).

### Security

- Detect threats and attacks with [Datadog Security](/security/).

## Integrations

Hundreds of [integrations](/getting_started/integrations/) allow you to layer Datadog features over the technologies you already use. For example, the [AWS integration][2] collects logs, events, and metrics from more than 90 AWS services.
