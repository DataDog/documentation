# A few helpful tips about the Rules file:
#
# * The string given to #compile and #route are matching patterns for
#   identifiers--not for paths. Therefore, you can’t match on extension.
#
# * The order of rules is important: for each item, only the first matching
#   rule is applied.
#
# * Item identifiers start and end with a slash (e.g. “/about/” for the file
#   “content/about.html”). To select all children, grandchildren, … of an
#   item, use the pattern “/about/*/”; “/about/*” will also select the parent,
#   because “*” matches zero or more characters.
