summary: Orchestration platforms like Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Amazon ECS make
  running containerized services easier and more resilient by handling workload scheduling
  and request routing. But all of that makes monitoring more difficult. How can you
  reliably monitor a service which by design constantly changes the definition normal
  as it moves applications between hosts? The Datadog Agent can automatically track
  which services are running where, thanks to its Autodiscovery feature. This video
  will show you how easy it is to get started with Autodiscovery on Kubernetes with
  Datadog.
