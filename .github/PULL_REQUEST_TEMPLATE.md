### Merge instructions

If the PR is ready to be merged once it receives the required reviews, check the box below after you've created the PR.
-->

Merge readiness:
- [ ] Ready for merge

**For Datadog employees**:

Your branch name MUST follow the `<name>/<description>` convention and include the forward slash (`/`). Without this format, your pull request will not pass CI, the GitLab pipeline will not run, and you won't get a branch preview. Getting a branch preview makes it easier for us to check any issues with your PR, such as broken links.

If your branch doesn't follow this format, rename it or create a new branch and PR.

[6/5/2025] Merge queue has been disabled on the documentation repo. If you have write access to the repo, the PR has been reviewed by a Documentation team member, and all of the required checks have passed, you can use the **Squash and Merge** button to merge the PR. If you don't have write access, or you need help, reach out in the #documentation channel in Slack.

### Additional notes
<!-- Anything else we should know when reviewing?-->

<!-- Previewing the PR: Assuming you are a Datadog employee and named your branch `<yourname>/<description>`, a preview build will run and links to the preview output will be auto-generated and posted in the PR comments. The links will 404 until the preview build is finished running. -->
