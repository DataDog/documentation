The Log Management solution is an all-in-one comprehensive solution that comprises [collection][1], [processing][2], live tailing, [exploration][3], [graphing][4], [dashboarding][5], [alerting][6] and archival over all the logs generated by [your application][7], and your infrastructure.

## Logging Without Limits

Sometimes the amount of log events generated by your infrastructure is too large and/or fluctuates a lot, raising the issue of choosing which logs should be sent to a Log Management solution and which should be sent to an archive. But filtering your logs before sending them inevitably leads to gaps in coverage, and often filters out valuable data. 

Datadog log management removes these limitations by decoupling log ingestion from indexation, which makes it possible to cost-effectively collect, process, and archive all your logs.
Datadog Index Filters avoid complex Agent level configuration and control what you want to index dynamically.
You can now:

* [Ingest all your log events without server side filtering][8]
* [Process and enrich all of them][9]
* [Live Tail over the whole infrastructure][10]
* [Dynamically decide what to include or exclude from your indexes to control your costs][11]
* [Get alerted when volumes grows unexpectedly over an index][12]
* [Archive all enriched logs][13]

This flexibility is critical in some exceptional situations such as outages, when you can disable specific filters to send more data. The inverse is true as well; if you over-consume because of a seasonal reason (Black Friday, Christmas, etc...) you can decide to selectively reduce some volume to avoid overages.
