Datadog's Logs is currently available via private beta. You can apply for inclusion in the beta via <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/log-management/">this form</a>.

## Overview
{{< img src="logs/index/pipeline_sketch.png" alt="Pipelines sketch" responsive="true" >}}

## Getting started with the Agent

Log collection requires an Agent version >= 6.0. Older versions of the Agent do not include the `Log collection` interface that we'll be using.
If you are not using it already, please follow the installation (or update) instructions [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/docs/beta/upgrade.md).

Collecting logs is **disabled** by default in the Datadog Agent, you need to enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

    log_enabled: true

* [Restart your agent](https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/203764515-Start-Stop-Restart-the-Datadog-Agent)

## Enabling log collection from integrations

To start collecting logs for a given integration, you need to uncomment the logs section in that integration's yaml file, and configure it for your environment.

If an integration does not support logs by default, you may need to use use the custom file configuration below.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
During the beta phase of Datadog Logs, not all integrations include log configurations out of the box. A current list of supported integrations and example configuration files is available below:
</div>

* Apache: [apache.yaml.example](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/nils/Logs-integration-beta/apache/conf.yaml.example)
* AWS: [See our dedicated page](/logs/aws)
* Haproxy: [haproxy.yaml.example](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/nils/Logs-integration-beta/haproxy/conf.yaml.example)
* IIS: [iis.yaml.example](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/nils/Logs-integration-beta/iis/conf.yaml.example)
* Java: [See our dedicated page for log4j, Log4j2 and Slf4j](/logs/languages/java)
* Mongo: [mongo.yaml.example](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/nils/Logs-integration-beta/mongo/conf.yaml.example)
* Nginx: [nginx.yaml.example](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/nils/Logs-integration-beta/nginx/conf.yaml.example)

## Custom log collection

The Datadog Agent can collect logs from files or the network (TCP or UDP) and forward them to Datadog. To configure this, create a new yaml file named after your log source ( `python.yaml` for python logs, ...)in the Agent's **conf.d** directory and set these options:


* `type` : (mandatory) type of log input source (**tcp** / **udp** / **file**)
* `port` / `path` : (mandatory) Set `port` if `type` is **tcp** or **udp**. Set `path` if `type` is **file**.
* `service` : (mandatory) name of the service owning the log
* `source` : (mandatory) attribute that defines which integration is sending the logs. "If the logs do not come from an existing integration then this field may include a custom source name. But we recommend matching this value to the namespace of any related custom metrics you are collecting, e.g, `myapp` from `myapp.request.count`)"
* `sourcecategory` : (optional) Multiple value attribute. Can be used to refine the source attribtue. Example: source:mongodb, sourcecategory:db_slow_logs
* `tags`: (optional) add tags to each log collected.

### Tail existing files
Set `type` to **file** then specify the absolute `path` to the log file you want to tail.

Example: 
If you want to gather your python app logs for instance stored in **/var/log/myapp1.log** and **/var/log/python.log** you would create a `python.yaml` file as follows:

Please note that for the yaml file to be considered valid by the agent, they must include an "init_config" section and have at least one "instance" defined as shown below:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
    [{}]
#Log section
logs:

  - type: file
    path: /var/log/myapp1.log
    service: myapp1
    source: python
    sourcecategory: sourcecode
    tags: env:prod

  - type: file
    path: /var/log/python.log
    service: myapplication
    source: python
    sourcecategory: sourcecode
```

### Stream logs through TCP/UDP
Set `type` to **tcp** or **udp** depending of your protocol then specify the `port` of your incomming connection.

Example: 
If your PHP application does not log to a file, but instead forwards its logs via TCP, you will need to create a configuration file that specifies the port to receive as in the example below:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
    [{}]
#Log section
logs:
  - type: tcp
    port: 10518
    service: webapp
    source: php
    sourcecategory: front

``

### Filter logs

All logs are not equal and you may want to send only a specific subset of logs to Datadog.
To achieve this use the `log_processing_rules` parameter in your configuration file with the **exclude_at_match** `type`

If the pattern is contained in the message the log is excluded, and not sent to Datadog.

Example: Filter out logs where the user field matches the datadoghq.com domain

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
    [{}]

logs:
 - type: file
   path: /my/test/file.log
   service: cardpayment
   source: java
   log_processing_rules:
    - type: exclude_at_match
      name: exclude_datadoghq_users
      # Regexp can be anything
      pattern: User=\w+@datadoghq.com
```

### Search and replace content in your logs

If your logs contain sensitive information that you wish you redact, you can configure sequences to mask in your configuration file. This is accomplished by using the `log_processing_rules` parameter in your configuration file with the **mask_sequences** `type`

This replaces all matched groups with `replace_placeholder` parameter value.
Example: Redact credit card numbers

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
    [{}]

logs:
 - type: file
   path: /my/test/file.log
   service: cardpayment
   source: java
   log_processing_rules:
      - type: mask_sequences
        name: mask_credit_cards
        replace_placeholder: "[masked_credit_card]"
        #One pattern that contains capture groups
        pattern: (?:4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?|[25][1-7][0-9]{14}|6(?:011|5[0-9][0-9])[0-9]{12}|3[47][0-9]{13}|3(?:0[0-5]|[68][0-9])[0-9]{11}|(?:2131|1800|35\d{3})\d{11})
```

## Reserved attributes 

If your logs are formatted as JSON, please note that some attributes are reserved for use by Datadog:

### *date* attribute

By default Datadog generates a timestamp and appends it in a date attribute when logs are received. 
However, if a JSON formatted log file includes one of the following attributes, Datadog will interpret its value as the the log’s official date:

* `@timestamp`
* `timestamp`
* `_timestamp`
* `Timestamp`
* `eventTime`
* `date`
* `published_date`
* `syslog.timestamp`

You can also specify alternate attributes to use as the source of a log's date by setting a [log date remapper processor](/logs/processing/#log-date-remapper)

<div class="alert alert-info">
The recognized date formats are: <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">ISO8601</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">UNIX (the milliseconds EPOCH format)</a>  and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt">RFC3164</a>.
</div>

### *message* attribute

By default, Datadog will ingest the value of message as the body of the log entry. That value will then be highlighted and display in the [log list](/logs/explore/#log-list), where it will be indexed for [full text search](/logs/explore/#search-bar).

### *severity* attribute

Each log entry may specify a severity level which will be made available for faceted search within Datadog. However, if a JSON formatted log file includes one of the following attributes, Datadog will interpret its value as the the log’s official severity:

* `syslog.severity`

If you would like to remap some severities existing in the `severity` attribute, you can do so with the [log severity remapper](/logs/processing/#log-severity-remapper)

### *host* attribute

Using the Datadog Agent or the RFC5424 format automatically set the host value on your logs. However, if a JSON formatted log file includes the following attribute, Datadog will interpret its value as the the log’s host:

* `syslog.hostname`

### *service* attribute

Using the Datadog Agent or the RFC5424 format automatically set the service value on your logs. However, if a JSON formatted log file includes the following attribute, Datadog will interpret its value as the the log’s service:

* `syslog.appname`

### Edit reserved attributes

You can now control the global hostname, service, timestamp, and severity main mapping that are applied before the processing pipelines. This is particularly helpful if logs are sent in JSON or from an external agent.

To change the default values for each of the reserved attributes, go to the pipeline page and edit the `Reserved Attribute mapping`:
