It is not recommended to use the Agent for log collection only. Using metric collection ensures that your logs, metrics, and traces from the same host share the same hostname and therefore the same [tags][1].

However, it is still possible to configure the Agent to only collect logs.

The Agent sends metrics to a specific url that is specified in the `datadog.yaml` file.

1. Open `datadog.yaml` ([locate this configuration file on your instance][3])
2. Edit the `dd_url` attribute to any custom value, for example:

```yaml
dd_url: xyz
```

3. Configure the Agent to collect logs as explained in our [log documentation page][2].
4. [Restart the Agent][4]
