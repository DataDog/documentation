title: Use our Webhook Integration to create a trello card
kind: faq
customnav: main_references

You can easily use our [Webhook Integration](/integrations/webhooks) to instantly create a trello card using our [@-notification feature](/monitors/notifications).

This flow will utilize the Trello REST POST card api endpoint to post the @notification to a relevant Trello list.

## Steps to Success

* Get the Trello App key and Token

* Find the List in the Board you'd like to submit cards to

* Configure Webhook


## Getting the Keys

To get the Trello App Key and Token, simply navigate to Trello's relevant page [here](https://trello.com/app-key). If you are logged in, you should be able to see the App key immediately:

NOTE: Trello mentions API key in the url. For this article, API and APP keys are one and the same

To get the Token , simply click the Token link (Green Arrow) above, authorize a token with the Trello Account you are currently logged into, and grab the token in the subsequent link:

## Designate the Trello List

Click on a card in the list you'd like to add cards to and append .json to the url and navigate to that url

From there, find the value of idList

## Configure the Webhook

The API documentation for Trello cards are here and our webhook integration is here

In the configuration:

* name is the alias for how you will reference this hook. (@webhook-NAME)

* URL will be `https://api.trello.com/1/cards`

You must enable Custom Payload and fill in a json object that will look like:

```json
{
"name": "$USER : $EVENT_TITLE",
"desc": "$EVENT_MSG",
"key": "{APP_KEY}",
"token": "{TOKEN_KEY}",
"pos":"bottom",
"idList": "{ID_LIST_VALUE}"
}
```

* **name**: title of the card
* **desc**: description of the card
* **key**: application key
* **token**: token key
* **pos**: relative position of the card on the list
* **idList**: list id

The resulting config should look like this:

## Some points to consider

This flow involves Trello generating a server token for our application. As you can see in the the token disclaimer:
{{< img src="developers/faq/trello_disclaimer.png" alt="trello_disclaimer" responsive="true" >}}

The token provides read/write access to all your boards and teams, so this is a potential concern if you do not want to give away access like that.

A good workaround would be to create a specific trello user that is only joined to the board you designate. Have that user receive the server token.
