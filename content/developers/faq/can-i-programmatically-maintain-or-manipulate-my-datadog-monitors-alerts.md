Today, there are multiple community projects for maintaining or managing Monitors along with some other Datadog components via theÂ API's:

* https://github.com/trueaccord/DogPush
* https://github.com/winebarrel/barkdog
* https://github.com/airbnb/interferon
* https://github.com/rapid7/dogwatch
* https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/datadog/r/monitor.html

There is also an example from Brightcove and Shopify that demonstrates backing up both Monitors and Dashboards [here](/developers/faq/can-i-backup-dashboards-or-monitors).
