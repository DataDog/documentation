Tags must start with a letter, and after that may contain alphanumerics,
underscores, minuses, colons, periods and slashes. Other characters will get
converted to underscores. Tags can be up to 200 characters long and support
unicode. Tags will be converted to lowercase as well.

Note: An exception to this is with trailing underscores, which will be trimmed off of tags (e.g. path:thing_ becomes path:thing).
