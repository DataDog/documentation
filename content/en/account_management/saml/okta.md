Additional information on configuring SAML for your Datadog account is available on the [SAML documentation page][2].

In the event that you need to upload an `IDP.XML` file to Datadog before being able to fully configure the application in Okta, see [acquiring the idp.xml metadata file for a SAML template App article][3] for field placeholder instructions.
