It's recommended that you set up Datadog as an Okta application manually, as opposed to using a 'pre-configured' configuration.

## General details

* **Single Sign On URL**: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/saml/assertion
    (NOTE: If using IdP initiated login, use a public ID-specific URL which is generated after enabling IdP initiated login in Datadog. Find this URL at the '[Configure SAML][1]' page, in the 'Assertion Consumer Service URL' field. Example URL: `https://app.datadoghq.com/account/saml/assertion/id/` This also applies to the **Recipient URL** and the **Destination URL** fields respectively.)

* **Recipient URL**: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/saml/assertion (or check the box labeled "Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL" in Okta)

* **Destination URL**: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/saml/assertion (or check the box labeled "Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL" in Okta)

* **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/saml/metadata.xml

* **Default Relay State**:

* **Name ID Format**: EmailAddress

* **Response**: Signed

* **Assertion Signature**: Signed

* **Signature Algorithm**: RSA_SHA256

* **Digest Algorithm**: SHA256
* **Assertion Encryption**: Assertions can be encrypted, but unencrypted assertions are also accepted.
* **SAML Single Logout**: Disabled
* **authnContextClassRef**: PasswordProtectedTransport
* **Honor Force Authentication**: Yes
* **SAML Issuer ID**: `http://www.okta.com/`

## Attribute statements details

* **NameFormat**: urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri
* **sn**: user.lastName
* **givenName**: user.firstName

Additional information on configuring SAML for your Datadog account is available on the [SAML documentation page][2]. If you are using the custom sub-domain feature, your specific details are also available there.

In the event that you need to upload an `IDP.XML` file to Datadog before being able to fully configure the application in Okta, see [acquiring the idp.xml metadata file for a SAML template App article][3] for field placeholder instructions.
