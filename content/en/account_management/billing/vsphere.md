## Overview

Datadog bills for each Agent installed on a vCenter server and each VM monitored.

## vSphere VM exclusion

Use the `vsphere.yaml` file to filter your VMs monitored by Datadog by using regex. See the [sample vsphere.d/conf.yaml][1] for an example.

When adding limits to existing VMs, the previously discovered VMs could stay in the [Infrastructure List][2] up to 24 hours. During the transition period, VMs display a status of `???`. This does not count towards your billing.

## Troubleshooting

For technical questions, contact [Datadog support][3].

For billing questions, contact your [Customer Success][4] Manager.
