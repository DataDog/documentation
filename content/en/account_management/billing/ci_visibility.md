## Overview

This guide provides a non-exhaustive list of billing considerations for [CI Visibility][1].

## Counting committers

A committer is an active Git contributor, identified by their Git author email address. For billing purposes, a committer is included if they make at least three commits in a given month.

## Charges for commits made by bots or actions performed in the GitHub UI

Datadog does not charge for bot or commits resulting from actions made in the GitHub UI. These types of commits are excluded from billing calculations.

## Excluding commits from specific people

Yes, you can exclude commits from specific people by using [exclusion filters][2].
