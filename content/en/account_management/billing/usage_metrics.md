title: Estimated Usage Metrics
kind: documentation
---

## Overview

Datadog calculates your current estimated usage in near real-time. Estimated usage metrics enable you to:

* Graph your estimated usage
* Create [monitors][3] around your estimated usage based on thresholds of your choosing
* Get [monitor alerts][4] of spikes or drops in your usage
* Assess the potential impact of code changes on your usage in near real-time

**Note**: These usage metrics are estimates that are not always matched to billable usage given their real-time nature. There is a 10-20% difference between estimated usage and billable usage on average. Due to the nature of the estimations, the margin of error is larger for small usage.

## Types of usage

Estimated usage metrics are generally available for the following usage types:

## Multi-Org usage

For accounts with multiple organizations, you can roll up estimated usage from child organizations using the `from` field to monitor usage across your entire account.
