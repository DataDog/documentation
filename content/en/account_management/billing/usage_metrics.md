title: Estimated Usage Metrics
kind: documentation

## Overview

Datadog calculates your current estimated usage in near real-time. Estimate usage metrics enable you to:

* Graph your estimated usage
* Create monitors around your estimated usage based on thresholds of your choosing
* Get instant alerts of spikes or drops in your usage
* Assess the potential impact of code changes on your usage in near real-time

**Note**: These usage metrics are estimates that won't always match up to billable usage given their real-time nature. There is a 10-20% difference between estimated usage and billable usage on average.

### Types of usage

Estimated usage metrics are generally available for the following usage types:

| Usage Type           | Metric                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|

### Multi-Org usage

For accounts with multiple organizations, you can roll up estimated usage from child organizations using the `from` field to monitor usage across your entire account.
