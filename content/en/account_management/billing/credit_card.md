title: Credit Card Billing
---

## Overview

Datadog accepts payment by credit card through the [Plan][1] page. Administrators can access this page by hovering over their username at the bottom left, then navigate to: `Plan & Usage`--> `Plan`.

By default, when you sign up with a credit card you are on a monthly plan. If you want to switch to an annual plan, contact your [Customer Success][2] Manager.

## Payment

Payment is collected by Datadog near the 10th business day of each month. Datadog reattempts failed charges up to two more times. If you have recently changed your payment method from invoicing to credit card, connect with your [Customer Success][2] Manager to ensure past items are queued to be charged. Future bills are auto charged. Only one payment method is stored on file at a time.

## Edit

### Update

Update your credit card through the [Plan][1] page by clicking the **Edit** button.

### Remove

To remove your credit card from Datadog, first downgrade to the **Free** plan. Then use the **Remove Card** button on the [Plan][1] page.

## Troubleshooting
