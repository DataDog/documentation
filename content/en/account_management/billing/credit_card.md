## Overview

Datadog accepts payment by credit card through the [Plan][1] page. Administrators can access this page by hovering over their username at the bottom left, then navigate to: `Plan & Usage`--> `Plan`.

By default, when you sign up with a credit card you are on a monthly plan. If you want to switch to an annual plan, contact your [Customer Success][2] Manager.

## Update

Update your credit card through the [Plan][1] page by clicking the **Edit** button.

## Remove

To remove your credit card from Datadog, first downgrade to the **Free** plan. Then use the **Remove Card** button on the [Plan][1] page.

## Troubleshooting

For technical questions, contact [Datadog support][3].

For billing questions, contact your [Customer Success][2] Manager.
