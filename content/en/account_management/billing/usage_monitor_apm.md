Datadog has many pricing plans to fit your needs. For more information, see the [Pricing page][1].
Read APM documentation on [APM Billing][2] to understand how billing works for APM and Distributed Tracing.

**Note:** Indexed Spans were formerly known as Analyzed Spans and renamed with the launch of Tracing Without Limits on October 20th, 2020.

## Set alert on APM hosts

To get alerts in case a code deployment scales the number of hosts sending traces, set up monitor on APM host count. Get notified if the host volumes in any scope (`prod`, `availablity-zone`, etcâ€¦) of your infrastructure is growing unexpectedly:

{{< img src="tracing/faq/apm_host_monitor.mp4" alt="Analytics View" video="true"  style="width:90%;">}}

1. Go to Monitors -> New Monitor
2. Set up a [new metric monitor][4] with `datadog.apm.host_instance`
3. Define the rate you would like to set as a warning or error.
4. Define an explicit notification: The volume of hosts on this env just got too high has exceeded the allocated threshold value. Scale down the number of APM enabled hosts.

## Set alert on indexed spans

To get alerts in case a code deployment causes a spike in Indexed Spans generated, set up [Analytics monitors][5] on Indexed Spans. Get notified at any moment if the Indexed Span volumes in any infrastructure scope (for example,`service`, `availability-zone`) is growing unexpectedly:

1. Go to [Analytics view][6] in APM
2. Select the `env` (you can select `*`)
3. Select `count` (you can select `*`)
4. Select Export -> Export to Monitor
5. Define the Indexed Span volume rate you would like to set as a warning or error.
6. Define an explicit notification: The volume of Indexed Spans on this service just got too high. Define an additional exclusion filter or increase the filtering rate to put it back under control.
