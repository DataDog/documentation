## Set Alert on APM Hosts

To get alerts in case a code deployment scales the number of hosts sending traces, set up monitor on APM host count. Get notified if the host volumes in any scope (`prod`, `availablity-zone`, etc…) of your infrastructure is growing unexpectedly:

{{< img src="tracing/faq/apm_host_monitor.mp4" alt="Analytics View" video="true"  style="width:90%;">}}

1. Go to Monitors -> New Monitor
2. Set up a [new metric monitor][4] with `datadog.apm.host_instance`
3. Define the rate you would like to set as a warning or error.
4. Define an explicit notification: The volume of hosts on this env just got too high has exceeded the allocated threshold value. Scale down the number of APM enabled hosts.

## Set Alert on Analyzed Spans

To get alerts in case a code deployment causes a spike in Analyzed Spans generated, set up [App Analytics monitors][5] on Analyzed Spans. Get notified at any moment if the Analyzed Span volumes in any scope (`service`, `availability-zone`, etc…) of your infrastructure is growing unexpectedly:

1. Go to [App Analytics view][6] in APM
2. Select the `env` (you can select `*`)
3. Select `count` (you can select `*`)
4. Select Export -> Export to Monitor
5. Define the Analyzed Span volume rate you would like to set as a warning or error.
6. Define an explicit notification: The volume of Analyzed Spans on this service just got too high. Define an additional exclusion filter or increase the filtering rate to put it back under control.
