Datadog has many pricing plans to fit your needs. For more information, see the [Pricing page][1].
Read APM documentation on [APM Billing][2] to understand how billing works for APM and Distributed Tracing.

### Usage Page

If you are an admin of your account, you can view your account usage using the [Usage Page][3] which gets updated every 72 hours.

| Metric | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| APM Hosts | Shows the 99th percentile of all distinct APM hosts over all hours in the current month. |
| APM Events | Shows the sum of all APM events indexed over all hours in the current month. |
| Fargate Tasks | Shows the average of all Fargate tasks over all hours in the current month. |

### Set Alert on APM Hosts

To get alerts in case a code deployment scales the number of hosts sending traces, set up monitor on APM host count. Get notified if the host volumes in any scope (`prod`, `availablity-zone`, etc…) of your infrastructure is growing unexpectedly:

{{< img src="tracing/faq/apm_host_monitor.mp4" alt="Analytics View" video="true" responsive="true" style="width:90%;">}}

1. Go to Monitors -> New Monitor
2. Set up a [new metric monitor][4] with `datadog.apm.host_instance`
3.  Define the rate you would like to set as a warning or error.
4. Define an explicit notification: The volume of hosts on this env just got too high has exceeded the allocated threshold value. Scale down the number of APM enabled hosts.

### Set Alert on APM events

To get alerts in case a code deployment causes a spike in APM events generated, set up [trace analytics monitors][5] on APM events. Get notified at any moment if the APM event volumes in any scope (`service`, `availability-zone`, etc…) of your infrastructure is growing unexpectedly:

{{< img src="tracing/faq/apm_events_monitor.mp4" alt="Analytics View" video="true" responsive="true" style="width:90%;">}}

1. Go to [Trace Analytics view][6] in APM
2. Select the `env` (you can select `*`)
3. Select `count` (you can select `*`)
4. Select Export -> Export to Monitor
5. Define the APM event volume rate you would like to set as a warning or error.
6. Define an explicit notification: The volume of APM Events on this service just got too high. Define an additional exclusion filter or increase the filtering rate to put it back under control.
