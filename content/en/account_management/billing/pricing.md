Datadog has many pricing plans to fit your needs. For more information, see the [Pricing][1] page. Unless otherwise stated in your order, Datadog calculates fees based on product usage during each calendar month. Here are the most common pricing units:

## Infrastructure monitoring

* A **host** is a physical or virtual operating system instance. Each hour, Datadog records the number of unique hosts you are monitoring in the Infrastructure service.
  * On a high watermark plan (HWMP), these hourly measurements are ordered from highest to lowest at the end of the month, and Datadog charges based on the eighth highest measurement.
  * On a hybrid monthly/hourly plan (MHP), Datadog charges your minimum monthly commitment, and for any host hours above that commitment, Datadog charges an hourly rate.
* A **container** is a self-contained operating environment that includes application software and limited operating system libraries and settings. Once every five minutes, Datadog records the number of unique containers you are monitoring in the Datadog Infrastructure service. Datadog charges monthly based on the fractional hours of monitored containers.
* A [**custom metric**][2] is a single, unique combination of a metric name, host ID and any tags. Datadog charges based on the monthly average of unique custom metrics submitted to the Datadog Infrastructure service per hour.
* A **device** is a physical sensor comprising one or more single-board computers in a frame. Datadog records and charges for the number of devices and hosts you are concurrently monitoring in the Datadog Infrastructure service.
* A **cloud function** is application code setup to execute on a cloud platform’s serverless compute service in response to defined events or actions (for example, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, and Azure Function). The Datadog Infrastructure service records the number of functions executed or invoked one or more times each hour. Datadog charges based on the average number of functions across all hours in a month.
* An AWS **Fargate task** is a collection of containers setup through AWS’s ECS container orchestration platform. Datadog records the number of task instances you are monitoring in the Datadog Infrastructure (or APM) service at five-minute intervals. Datadog aggregates the interval-based measurements at the end of the month and charges you based on the total number of hours your applications were run and monitored.

## APM

* Datadog records the number of unique **APM hosts** you are monitoring in the Datadog APM service each hour.
  * On a high watermark plan (HWMP), these hourly measurements are ordered from highest to lowest at the end of the month, and Datadog charges based on the eighth highest measurement.
  * On a hybrid monthly/hourly plan (MHP), Datadog charges your minimum monthly commitment, and for any host hours above that commitment, Datadog charges an hourly rate.
* An **Analyzed Span** is an individual request against an individual service in your stack. Datadog charges based on the total number of Analyzed Spans submitted to the Datadog APM service.

## Log management

* A **log** is a text-based record of activity generated by an operating system, an application, or by other sources. Datadog charges for ingested logs based on the total number of gigabytes submitted to the Datadog Logs service.
* A **log event** is a log that is indexed by the Datadog Logs service. Datadog charges per million log events submitted for indexing at the rate designated for the retention policy you selected.

## Synthetics

* An **API test** is an HTTP or HTTPS request against a single URL. Datadog charges per ten thousand API tests runs executed to the Datadog Synthetics service.
* A **browser test** is a simulation of a scripted sequence of user actions on a web-based application using a virtualized web browser. Datadog charges per thousand browser tests executed to the Datadog Synthetics service.

## Network Performance Monitoring

* Datadog records the number of **Network Performance Monitoring** (NPM) hosts you are concurrently monitoring with the Datadog NPM service once per hour.
  * These hourly measurements are ordered from highest to lowest at the end of the month, and Datadog charges based on the eighth-highest measurement.
* Additionally, Datadog measures the total number of flows used by all NPM hosts per month. A **flow** is a record of traffic sent and received between a source (IP:Port) and destination (IP:Port), as measured over a five-minute time period.

## Real User Monitoring

* A **session** is a user journey on your web application. It expires after 15 minutes of inactivity.

* Datadog collects all the pages visited by your end users along with the telemetry that matters: resources loading (XHRs, images, CSS files, JS scripts, etc), frontend errors, and long tasks. All of this is included in the user session. Datadog charges per ten thousand (10,000) sessions ingested in the Datadog Real User Monitoring (RUM) service.
