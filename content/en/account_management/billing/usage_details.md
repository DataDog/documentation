## Overview

Administrators can access the [Usage][1] page by hovering over their username at the bottom left, then navigate to:
`Plan & Usage`--> `Usage`.

The Usage page shows usage grouped by product category. You can navigate to a product tab to view usage specific to that product category or the "All" tab to view usage of all products. Each tab provides the following information:

* Month-to-Date Summary
* Overall Usage (current and historical)

Certain product tabs also contain additional tools:

* Custom Metrics Tab: Top Custom Metrics
* Log Management Tab: Logs Usage by Index

## Month-to-date summary

This section summarizes your month-to-date usage. In the "All" tab, you will see your month-to-date usage of infrastructure hosts, containers, custom metrics, APM hosts, logs and any other part of the platform you've used during the month.

In product specific tabs, you will see your month-to-date usage of the products in that product category.

{{< img src="account_management/billing/usage-details-v2-02.png" alt="Usage Summary - Network" >}}

The month-to-date usage shown above is "All" usage, which includes non-billable usage such as product trials. Most accounts will also be able to view "Billable" usage, which only shows usage that contributes to your final bill. The "Billable" view also breaks out on-demand usage above your commitments and allocations.

Month-to-date usage of each product is calculated as follows:

Most accounts have access to the feature Included Lines, which allows you to see how your usage is tracking over the month. The graphs on your Usage page contain an "Included" line that shows commitments per product plus any allowances (such as, custom metrics, containers).

{{< img src="account_management/billing/usage-details-v3-01.png" alt="Usage graph with an Included line" >}}

## Top custom metrics

In the Custom Metrics tab, this table lists the following information about your Top 5000 custom metrics month-to-date usage and most recent day usage (i.e., usage on the date of the last update):

* Metric name
* Average custom metrics per hour
* Max custom metrics per hour
* The metric's contribution percentage to the overall custom metrics usage

This data can be downloaded as a CSV file.

For more details on your metrics, navigate to the [Metrics Summary][5] from the Usage page by hovering over the row of the metric you are interested in and clicking on the meter icon that shows up on the right-hand side.
