## Overview

Administrators can access the [Usage][1] page by hovering over their username at the bottom left, then navigate to:
`Plan & Usage`--> `Usage`.

The Usage page shows usage grouped by product category. You can navigate to a product tab to view usage specific to that product category or the "All" tab to view usage for all products. Each tab provides the following information:

* Month-to-Date Summary
* Overall Usage (current and historical)

Certain product tabs also contain additional tools:

* Custom Metrics Tab: Top Custom Metrics
* Log Management Tab: Logs Usage by Index

## Month-to-date summary

This section summarizes your month-to-date usage. In the "All" tab, view your month-to-date usage of infrastructure hosts, containers, custom metrics, APM hosts, logs, and any other part of the platform you've used during the month. 

{{< img src="account_management/billing/usage-details-v2-01.png" alt="Usage Summary - All tab" >}}

In product specific tabs, view your month-to-date usage of the products in that product category.

{{< img src="account_management/billing/usage-details-v2-02.png" alt="Usage Summary - Network" >}}

The month-to-date usage shown above is "All" usage, which includes non-billable usage such as product trials. Most accounts are able to view "Billable" usage, which only shows usage that contributes to your final bill. The "Billable" view breaks out on-demand usage above your commitments and allocations.

For API users, endpoints are available to access ["All"][2] usage and ["Billable"][3] usage.

Month-to-date usage of each product is calculated as follows:

## Usage trends

The [Usage Trends][5] section contains product usage graphs displaying summed usage for all organizations across an account. Usage reports are downloadable through the **Download as CSV** button. For each organization, these reports include an hourly breakdown of usage by product. 

{{< img src="account_management/billing/UsageTrendsOverviewAndCSV.png" alt="Usage Trends graphs page in the Datadog application with Download as CSV option highlighted" style="width:100%; align:left" >}}

For products with subtypes, each category is distinguished on the graph for that product. 

{{< img src="account_management/billing/UsageGraphsByProductTab.png" alt="Usage summary with infrastructure tab selected and multiple graphs for infrastructure usage subtypes such as infra hosts, agent hosts, and containers" style="width:100%; align:left" >}}

More detailed product subtype graphs can be found on each product's tab. For example, a breakdown by host type is available on the Infrastructure tab.

{{< img src="account_management/billing/UsageBreakdownByProductSubtype.png" alt="Usage trends section of the Infrastructure tab with Infra Hosts graph containing Agent hosts and AWS hosts, Indexed Logs graph containing Daily Indexed Live Logs and Cumulative Indexed Live Logs" style="width:100%; align:left" >}}
 
Cumulative usage over time is available for sum-based products.

{{< img src="account_management/billing/CumulativeUsageLine.png" alt="Graphs for Ingested Spans and Indexed Spans, each plotting data for the daily and cumulative sums of their respective spans" style="width:100%; align:left" >}}

Time selection contains options to view usage graphs at daily, weekly, monthly or yearly intervals.

{{< img src="account_management/billing/TimeGranularity.png" alt="Time intervals on usage graphs" style="width:100%; align:left" >}}

The dashed `Committed` line shows commitments per product, without any allowances (such as Custom Metrics or Containers). 

{{< img src="account_management/billing/CommittedLine.png" alt="Committed usage line on APM Hosts graph configured with the value 10" style="width:100%; align:left" >}}

 

## Top custom metrics

In the Custom Metrics tab, the Top Custom Metrics table provides two views for your month-to-date usage and most recent day usage, such as usage on the date of the last update).

The "Top 5000" view provides the following information about your Top 5000 custom metrics:
* Metric name
* Average custom metrics per hour
* Max custom metrics per hour
* The metric's contribution percentage to the overall custom metrics usage
* Search for a metric within your top 5000 custom metrics
* This data can be downloaded as a CSV file.

The "All" view provides the following information about all your custom metrics:
* Metric name
* Average custom metrics per hour
* Max custom metrics per hour
* Search for a metric within all your custom metrics
* This data can be downloaded as a CSV file, with a maximum of 300,000 custom metrics. You can download over 300,000 custom metrics using our [API endpoint][6].


For more details on your metrics, navigate to the [Metrics Summary][7] by hovering over the row of the metric you are interested in and clicking on the meter icon that shows up on the right side.

## Logs usage by index

In the Log Management tab, this table displays your hourly, daily, monthly, and annual indexed log usage by index name and retention period. It also shows the breakdown between live logs and [rehydrated logs][8]. The following information is provided:

* Index name
* Retention period in days
* Indexed log count
* The index's contribution percentage to the overall indexed log usage for the time period selected

This data can be downloaded as a CSV file.
