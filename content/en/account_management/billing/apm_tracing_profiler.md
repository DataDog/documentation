APM is available through three tiers: APM, APM Pro, and APM Enterprise. APM gives you deep visibility into your applications, with distributed tracing capabilities, seamless correlation between traces, logs, and other telemetry, and out-of-the-box performance dashboards for your service. With Continuous Profiler in APM Enterprise, you can pinpoint the slowest and most resource-intensive methods, in aggregate at the service and endpoint levels, as well as for every distributed trace. With Data Streams Monitoring (DSM) in APM Pro and APM Enterprise, you can easily track the end-to-end performance of your data streaming pipelines and event-driven applications that use Kafka and RabbitMQ.

| [APM Host][5]      | $31 per underlying [APM host][5] per month | 1 million Indexed Spans and 150 GB of Ingested Spans included per month with every APM host.   | Datadog records the number of [APM hosts][5] you are concurrently monitoring in the Datadog APM service once an hour. On a high watermark plan (HWMP), these hourly measurements are ordered from highest to lowest at the end of the month, and Datadog charges based on the ninth highest measurement.

The hourly measurements and billing for APM Pro are conducted the same as for APM Hosts.  |
| APM Enterprise (APM Host with Data Streams Monitoring & [Continuous Profiler)][6] | $40 per underlying [APM host][5]. Includes Data Streams Monitoring and [Continuous Profiler][6] with four profiled containers per host per month. | Same as APM Host | Datadog records the number of unique APM hosts in the APM service, unique DSM hosts, and unique Continuous Profiler hosts you are concurrently monitoring once per hour.

**Notes**:  
   - If you're using a non-Fargate container based environment, you get billed for the underlying host deploying the Datadog Agent.
   - One profiled container is a container that is running the Continuous Profiler service. This does not include containers that are not being profiled. For instance, a DNS service container that is NOT profiled, running concurrently with your application container that IS profiled, is not counted towards the four profiler containers allotment.
   - [Universal Service Monitoring][15] is included in all APM tiers (APM, APM Pro, APM Enterprise) at no additional cost.

## Database Monitoring

| Billing Parameter  | Normalized Queries                | Billing                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Database host      | 200 normalized queries are included per month with every database host. | Datadog records the number of database hosts you are concurrently monitoring with Database Monitoring once an hour. On a high watermark plan (HWMP), these hourly measurements are ordered from highest to lowest at the end of the month, and Datadog charges based on the ninth highest measurement. The month of February is an exception and Datadog charges based on the eighth highest measurement. |
| Normalized Queries | Billed when the configured threshold is in excess of normalized queries that are included with every database host. | A _normalized query_ represents an aggregate of queries with similar structure, differing only by the query parameters. Datadog charges based on the total number of configured normalized queries being tracked at any given time. |

## FAQ

**1. What is classified as an APM host for billing?**

A [host][4] is a physical or virtual operating system instance. Datadog records the number of hosts you are concurrently monitoring in the Datadog Infrastructure service once an hour. For billing APM, number of hosts with [APM installed][12] and sending traces are calculated every hour. At the end of the month, you are billed based on your 99th percentile usage for [APM hosts][5].

**2. How is billing calculated when deploying one Agent per container?**

It is recommended that you set up _one Agent per underlying host_ for container deployment. If you choose instead to run one Agent per container, then each container is treated as a single host. The price is then (Price Per APM host) * (Number of containers).

**3. What is classified as an APM Fargate task for billing?**

A Fargate task is a collection of containers that are scheduled to run on AWS Fargate as a serverless compute engine. Datadog records the number of tasks you are concurrently monitoring in Datadog at five-minute intervals. For billing APM, Datadog bills based on the average number of Fargate tasks that send traces to Datadog per hour across the month of your account.

**4. What happens to your bill when scaling your environment?**

Your APM bill is calculated using the top 99 percentile of active agents sending traces every hour of each month. At the end of the month, Datadog disregards the top 1% value, giving a shield against being billed for unexpected spikes.

**5. Do you get charged for pause containers in Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes creates pause containers to acquire the respective pod's IP address and set up the network namespace for all other containers that join that pod. Datadog excludes all pause containers from your quota and does not charge for them (requires Agent 5.8+). For Kubernetes, APM is priced by nodes not by pods.

**6. How is the host billing related to your services?**

APM is billed on the basis of [hosts][5] deployed with agents sending traces and not services. Additionally, over the monthly allocation by host, APM is billed on the basis of Ingested span volume and Indexed span count. To estimate how many ingested and indexed spans each of your services is sending, see the [ingestion][2] and [retention][13] documentation.

**7. What happens to your existing App Analytics filters?**

As of October 20, 2020, all existing App Analytics filters are automatically transitioned to Retention Filters. You can continue to let the filters remain unchanged or modify them as needed. Transitioned filters are marked with an *i* representing Legacy App Analytics Filters within the [retention filters][3] page.

**8. How do you estimate your ingested or indexed span volume?**

Datadog provides the metrics `datadog.estimated_usage.apm.ingested_bytes` and `datadog.estimated_usage.apm.ingested_spans` for monitoring ingested and indexed span volume. More information is available in the [Usage Metrics][14] documentation.

**9. Is the Continuous Profiler available as a standalone product?**

Yes. Let Datadog know if you are interested in buying the Continuous Profiler without APM. Reach out to [Sales][8] or your [Customer Success Manager][9].

**10. Is Data Streams Monitoring available as a standalone product?**

Yes. Let Datadog know if you are interested in buying Data Streams Monitoring without APM. Reach out to [Sales][8] or your [Customer Success Manager][9].
