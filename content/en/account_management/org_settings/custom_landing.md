title: Custom Organization Landing Page

## Overview

The Datadog organization landing page is the first page your users see when they log on to Datadog or navigate to the Datadog root page. Datadog sets a default landing page for your organization. If you use APM, Datadog sets the APM root as the landing page. If you donâ€™t use APM, then the list of dashboards is the default landing page.

As an alternative to the default page, Datadog allows administrators to set a dashboard as the landing page for the organization. A custom landing page helps a large or small organization control the narrative for their users.

You can customize a dashboard with the information you want your users to see when they first log on to Datadog. Use [Organization settings][1] to set that dashboard as the custom landing page for your organization.

## Set a custom landing page

Only users with the Datadog Admin Role or the Org Management (`org_management`) permission can set the custom landing page for an organization.

To set a custom landing page, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to [Organization settings][1].
2. From the tabs on the left, select **Preferences**.
3. In the Datadog Homepage section, click the **Dashboard** button.
4. Use the dropdown list to select a dashboard.
5. Click the **Save** button.

## Use the default landing page

Only users with the Datadog Admin Role or the Org Management (`org_management`) permission can change the landing page for an organization.

To restore the default landing page of APM Home, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to [Organization settings][1].
2. From the tabs on the left, select **Preferences**.
3. In the Datadog Homepage section, click the **Default: APM Home** button.
4. Click the **Save** button.
