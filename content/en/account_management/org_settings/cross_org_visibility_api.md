  Cross-organization visibility is in <strong>private beta</strong> for customers with Enterprise plans. If you're interested in the feature, reach out to your Technical Account Manager or Customer Success Manager.

[Cross-organization visibility][1] allows customers to share data between different organizations in the same account, and show insights from multiple organizations in one place.

This document describes how to configure cross-organization connections through the API. To configure connections through the UI, see [cross-organization visibility][1].

## API endpoint

Configure connections through the public API `/api/v2/org_connections` endpoint. The application key you use to authenticate to the endpoint must have the [`org_management`][2] permission.

## List connections

List all the connections this organization participates in, either as a source organization or as a destination organization.

https://{datadog_site}/api/v2/org_connections?api_key={datadog_api_key}&application_key={datadog_application_key}

## Create a connection

Creates a connection from this organization to the destination organization. You must perform this operation in the to-be-source organization.

<span style="padding:3px" class="font-semibold text-api-post bg-bg-api-post">POST</span> https://{datadog_site}/api/v2/org_connections?api_key={datadog_api_key}&application_key={datadog_application_key}

**Note:** The payload of this call requires the destination organization UUID. Get the destination organization's UUID from the "List your managed organizations" [endpoint][3].
