  The Domain Allowlist feature is available for customers on the Enterprise plan
{{< /callout >}} 

The [Domain Allowlist][1] enables you to restrict the email domains to which notifications can be sent. You can access and modify your Domain Allowlist in Datadog, or by using the API.

Access your [**Domain Allowlist**][1] under **Organization Settings**. To read or edit your Domain Allowlist, you need the **Org Management** permission.

## Usage

### Enable or disable Domain Allowlist

Use the **Enable** or **Disable** button on the [Domain Allowlist][1] page.

To enable Domain Allowlist, you must add one or more domains to the allowlist. If you remove all domains from the allowlist, Domain Allowlist automatically becomes disabled.

If Domain Allowlist is disabled, all notifications are unrestricted, even if the allowlist contains domains.

### Add, edit, or remove a domain
