title: Plan and Usage Settings
---

[Administrators][1] can access the [organization settings][2] by clicking Plan & Usage from the Account menu in the bottom of the left side navigation or by selecting Plan & Usage from the header dropdown at the top of the Personal Settings page.

## Usage reports

View hourly usage of your account across all billable parameters as well as the top 5000 custom metrics submitted. If your organization is the parent-organization in a [multi-org account][3], you can also view the usage of child-organization accounts by toggling between "Overall" and "Individual Organizations" at the top of the page. Individual child-organization accounts are isolated. They are only able to view their own usage and custom metrics.

**Note**: Allow up to 72 hours for this section to update.

Further detailed usage reports can also be created [on request][4] by your account representative.

## Plan settings

Upgrade or downgrade your account from the **Plan** tab on the Plan & Usage section.

**Note**: Contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com][4] to add or remove paid features that are not part of standard plans.


## Billing history

Your account billing history is available from the **Billing History** tab in the [Plan & Usage section][2]. For specific billing questions, contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com][4].
