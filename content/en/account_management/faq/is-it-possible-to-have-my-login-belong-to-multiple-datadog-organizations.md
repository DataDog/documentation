Yes. The [multi-account feature][1] enables you to create new organizations. To enable this feature for your organization, contact [Datadog support][2].

Once this feature has been enabled, access the [organization creation page][3] to define new organizations:

Note: your new organization name must be **32 characters or fewer**.

Users need the the Org Management (`org_management`) permission to access the organization creation page. Hover over your avatar in the lower left corner, then click "New Organization".

After creating your organizations, switch between them using the menu that pops up when you hover over your avatar.

Once the new organization has been set up, invite people to your new organization from the Team page.
