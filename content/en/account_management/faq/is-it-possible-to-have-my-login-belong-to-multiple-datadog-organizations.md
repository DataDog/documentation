Yes. The [multi-account feature][1] enables you to create new organizations. To enable this feature for your organization, contact [Datadog support][2].

Once this feature has been enabled, you can access the [organization creation page][3] to define new organizations:

{{< img src="account_management/faq/createorg1.png" alt="createorg1"  >}}

Note: your new organization name must be **32 characters or fewer**.

Administrators users can access this organization creation page from the menu that appears when hovering over their avatar in the lower left corner, and then clicking on "Create New Organization":

{{< img src="account_management/faq/createorg2.png" alt="createorg2"  >}}

After creating your organizations, you can switch between any Datadog accounts you're associated with from this same menu.

Once the new organization has been set up, you can invite people to your new organization from the Team page, just as you would your regular account.
