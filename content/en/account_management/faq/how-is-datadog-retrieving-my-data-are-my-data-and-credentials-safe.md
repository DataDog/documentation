title: How is Datadog retrieving my data? Are my data and credentials safe?
kind: faq

* Traffic is always initiated by the Agent to Datadog. No sessions are ever initiated from Datadog back to the Agent.
* All traffic is sent over SSL.
* All communication to Datadog is via HTTPS.
* [The full license agreement][1].
* [The Agent is entirely open source][2].
* Some installations (for example, installing the Agent on CentOS 5), request your password. The password is needed because it's installing packagesâ€”Datadog does not retain it in any way. You can also use the step-by-step directions if you prefer to see exactly what the script is doing.

See the [list of IPs and ports used by Datadog][3] for more information.
