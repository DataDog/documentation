Datadog offers 3 ways to quickly provision users to their respective organizations:

* Batches of users can be added via Datadog within the [Team tab][1]
* [API user creation][2]
* Use an authentication service like [SAML][3]. [Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning][4] can be enabled allowing users with valid single sign-on credentials to have their Datadog organization automatically created when they attempt to log in.
