title: Help! My Password email never came through!
---

When a new user creates an account, your login email (or "handle") defaults to your email address. This can cause some confusion when a user wants to update their email.

Users can update their communications email independently in Datadog, but they aren't able to update their handle without help from [support][1]. This means that after updating their communication email address on their own, they still need to sign in with their old email address.

When attempting to reset your password, check if you previously changed your email within Datadog.

Confirm this from the team page as shown here:

{{< img src="account_management/faq/handle_image.png" alt="handle image" >}}

Enter your email address using the password reset link:

`http://{{< region-param key="dd_full_site" >}}/account/forgot_password`

If you have confirmed your email address is correct and you still have not received your password reset email, check your spam and filtered emails.  

Once you have confirmed that you have not received your email, contact [Datadog support][1].
