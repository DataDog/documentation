title: As a parent account admin, how do I create new sub-organizations?
---

Users can access the [Create New Organization][1] feature in the settings (reach out to your account representative to enable this feature).

This feature allows all users with the Org Management (`org_management`) permission in the parent account to create new sub-organizations. New sub-organizations are treated as completely separate entities, allowing users to be part of multiple Datadog organizations, each with data accessible only to users within those organizations.
