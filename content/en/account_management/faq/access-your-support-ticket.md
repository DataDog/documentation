If you have opened at least one Datadog support ticket, follow this process to access all your Datadog support tickets:

* Get a password from Zendesk by clicking this link on the sign in page of this website: `https://help.datadoghq.com`
    {{< img src="help/sign_in.png" alt="sing in" responsive="true" >}}

After you receive the password, log in. You are then directed to this location: `https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/requests`

From here, you are able to see your requests:
    {{< img src="help/my_activities.png" alt="my activities" responsive="true" >}}

If you don't see this after logging in, click on your name in the upper right hand corner, and then select "My Activities" from there.

If you would like to view your entire organization's tickets, reach out to [Datadog support][1].
