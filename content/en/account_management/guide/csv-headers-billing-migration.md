The headers for Plan & Usage Cost Chargebacks CSV files will be updated the week of February 19, 2024. The updates align the costs in the CSV file with the cost data shown in-app. 

If you have automation that relies on the CSV headers in the cost chargebacks file you download from the Usage page, these headers are changing and your automation needs to be updated. Below is the section where the changes are taking place, and includes an example of the new CSV headers to support the migration.
