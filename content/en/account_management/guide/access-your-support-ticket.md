## Troubleshooting
### Error: Refused to connect
**Refused to connect** errors come from privacy settings that block third-party cookies. To solve this issue, make sure the browser allows third-party cookies from Zendesk. Find instructions on how to [Clear, enable, and manage cookies in Chrome][1] in Google Chrome Help.

If your browser has ad-blockers, turn them off to see if this allows you to sign in. Some ad-blockers have their own list of exceptions. In this case, add **datadog.zendesk.com** to the allow list.
