## Manage access to individual resources

Some resources allow you to restrict access to individual resources by roles, [Teams][1], or users.

Use the different principals to control access patterns in your organization and encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration:
- Use Teams to map access to functional groups in your organizations. For example, restrict editing of a dashboard to the application team that owns it.
- Use roles to map access to personas. For example, restrict editing of payment methods to billing administrators.
- Allocate access to individual users only when necessary.

### Elevate access to individual resources

A user with the `user_access_manage` permission can elevate their access to any individual resource that supports restrictions based on team, role, and user or service account. Resources with only role-based access restrictions are not supported. To get access, click the **Elevate Access** button in the granular access control modal.
