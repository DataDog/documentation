Once your roles are created, assign or remove permission to this role directly by [updating the role in the Datadog application][1], or through the [Datadog Permission API][2]. Find below a list of available permissions.

## Overview

### General permissions

General permissions provide the base level of access for your role. [Advanced Permissions](#advanced-permissions) are explicitly defined permissions that augment the base permissions.

{{< permissions group="General" >}}

**Note**: There is no `read-only` permission as it is defined by the lack of both the `admin` and `standard` permissions for a role.

### Advanced permissions

By default, existing users are already associated with one of the three out-of-the-box Datadog Admin, Standard, or Read-Only Roles, so all users already have permissions to read all data types, and Admin or Standard users already have write permissions on assets.

**Note**: When adding a new custom role to a user, make sure to remove the out-of-the-box Datadog role associated with that user in order to enforce the new role permissions.

In addition of the general permissions, it is possible to define more granular permissions for specific assets or data types. Permissions can be either global or scoped to a subset of elements. Find below the details of these options and the impact they have on each available permission.
