  Datadog CloudPrem is in Preview.

## Dashboards

CloudPrem provides an out-of-the-box dashboard that monitors CloudPrem's key metrics

### Setup

These metrics are exported by [DogStatsD][1]. You can either:

- Run DogStatsD as a standalone service, or
- Run the Datadog Agent (which includes DogStatsD by default)

Configure either option with your organization's API key to export these metrics. As soon as your CloudPrem cluster is connected to Datadog, the OOTB dashboard is automatically created, and you can access it from your [Dashboards list][2].
