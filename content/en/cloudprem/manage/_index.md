## Dashboards

CloudPrem provides an Out-Of-The-Box dashboard which monitors CloudPrem's key metrics:
- RED metrics for ingest, search and metastore requests.
- Indexing throughput, pending merge metric and object storage GET/PUT metrics

As soon as your CloudPrem cluster is connected to Datadog, the OOTB dashboard is automatically created. You can have access to it in your [dashboards page](https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists?q=cloudprem&p=1).

## Alerts, autoscaling, upgrades
