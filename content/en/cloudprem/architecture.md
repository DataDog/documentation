## Overview

{{< img src="/cloudprem/overview_architecture.png" alt="CloudPrem architecture showing Indexers, Searchers, Metastore, and Control Plane components interacting with object storage" style="width:100%;" >}}

CloudPrem uses a decoupled architecture which separates the compute (indexing and searching) and data on an object storage. This allows for independent scaling and optimization of different cluster components based on workload demands.

## Components

The CloudPrem cluster, typically deployed on Kubernetes (EKS), consists of several components:

**Indexers**
: Responsible for receiving logs from Datadog Agents. Indexers process, index, and store logs in index files called _splits_ to the object storage (for example, Amazon S3).

**Searchers**
: Handle search queries from the Datadog UI, reading metadata from Metastore and index data from the object storage.

**Metastore**
: Stores metadata about the indexes, including splits locations on the object storage. CloudPrem uses PostgreSQL for this purpose.

**Janitor/Control Plane**
: Responsible for tasks like indexing tasks scheduling and delete tasks.
