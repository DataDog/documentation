## Overview

{{< img src="/cloudprem/overview_diagram_cloudprem.png" alt="CloudPrem architecture overview showing how logs flow from sources through CloudPrem to the Datadog platform" style="width:100%;" >}}

Datadog CloudPrem is a self-hosted log management solution that enables cost-effective log ingestion, processing, indexing, and search capabilities within your own infrastructure. Built to meet data residency, stringent security, and high-volume requirements, CloudPrem integrates with the Datadog platform to provide log analysis, visualization, and alerting â€” all while keeping your log data at rest within your infrastructure boundaries.

## Key features

- **Self-hosted**: Deploy CloudPrem within your own infrastructure and store your logs on your object storage.
- **Cost-effective**: Low infrastructure costs thanks to decoupled compute and storage architecture and fast search on object storage.
- **Scalable**: Horizontally scalable architecture to handle high-volume log ingestion.
- **Integrated in Datadog**: CloudPrem works with Datadog's log core features such as full-text search, Dashboards, monitors and more.
