## Overview

Symbol Database enhances the user experience of [Dynamic Instrumentation][1]  by adding IDE-like features like search and autocomplete. 

Symbol Database uploads nonsensitive symbols and metadata from your application to Datadog. The uploaded data includes the names of classes, methods, arguments, fields, and local variables, along with related metadata, like line numbers.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Symbol Database requires the following:

- [Dynamic Instrumentation][1] is enabled for your service.
- [Datadog Agent][2] 7.45.0 or higher is installed alongside your service.
- [Remote Configuration][3] is enabled in the Agent.
- The [Unified Service Tagging][4] tags `service`, `env`, and `version` are applied to your deployment.

### Enable Symbol Database for your service

With Symbol Database, the user experience of Dynamic Instrumentation is improved to behave more like an IDE.

Symbol Database provides search for class and method names:

When you select a method in the Dynamic Instrumentation configuration, the code for that method is displayed:

Symbol Database also provides autocomplete for log templates and other templates that use the [Dynamic Instrumentation expression language][5]:
