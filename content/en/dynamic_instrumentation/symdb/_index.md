## Overview

Autocomplete and search enhance the user experience of [Dynamic Instrumentation][1] by adding IDE-like features like class and method search and autocomplete for [Dynamic Instrumentation Expression Language][5].

To provide autocomplete and search, nonsensitive symbols and metadata are uploaded from your application to Datadog. The uploaded data includes the names of classes, methods, arguments, fields, and local variables, along with related metadata, like line numbers.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Autocomplete and search require the following:

- [Dynamic Instrumentation][1] is enabled for your service.
- [Datadog Agent][2] 7.45.0 or higher is installed alongside your service.
- [Remote Configuration][3] is enabled in the Agent.
- The [Unified Service Tagging][4] tags `service`, `env`, and `version` are applied to your deployment.

### Enable autocomplete and search for your service

Select your runtime below:

## Explore autocomplete and search

With autocomplete and search, the user experience of Dynamic Instrumentation is improved to behave more like an IDE.

Dynamic Instrumentation provides search for class and method names:

When you select a method in the Dynamic Instrumentation configuration, the code for that method is displayed:

Dynamic Instrumentation also provides autocomplete for log templates and other templates that use the [Dynamic Instrumentation expression language][5]:
