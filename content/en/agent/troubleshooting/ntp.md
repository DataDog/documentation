If you have noticed any of the following issues, they may be related to the NTP offset on the hosts that are reporting metrics through the Agent:

* Incorrect alert triggers
* Metric delays
* Gaps in graphs of metrics

To check the NTP offset for a host, run the Agent [status command][1], using the instructions appropriate for your OS, and look for the Clocks section:

```
  Clocks
  ======
    NTP offset: -0.0036 s
    System UTC time: 2015-02-12 22:10:49.524660
```

Any significant offset can have undesired effects. To prevent NTP issues, leverage Datadog's monitor for NTP offset to alert you when there is drift on a host thanks to the [NTP Integration][2].
Alternatively, use Datadog's [Check Summary page][3] and inspect the check `ntp.in_sync` to see the list of hosts that have NTP issues.

**Note**: Outgoing UDP traffic over the port `123` should be allowed so the Agent can confirm that the local server time is reasonably accurate according to the Datadog NTP servers.
