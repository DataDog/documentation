If you have not yet installed the Datadog Agent, go [to the dedicated Agent integration page][1] for installation instructions. If you just installed the Agent, it may take a few moments before you start seeing metrics appear. The first place you should check for metrics is the [Metrics Explorer][2].

If you think you might be experiencing issues, follow this checklist first:

* Is your host connected to the internet or able to access it through a proxy?
* If using a proxy: is your [Agent configured for this proxy][3]?
* Is the Datadog API key set up in your `datadog.yaml` configuration file [the API key corresponding to your Datadog platform][4]?
* Is the site configured in your `datadog.yaml` configuration file [matching the one from your organization][5]?
* Is there only one Datadog Agent running on your host?
* Did you restart the Datadog Agent after editing a yaml configuration file?

If the answer to all questions above is `yes`, then [run the status command][6] for more details about your Agent and its integrations status. You can also check the [Agent logs][7] directly and enable debug mode to [get more logging from the Agent][8].

If you're still unsure about the issue, you may reach out to the [Datadog support team][9] with [a flare][10] from your Agent.
