title: RPM GPG Key Rotation for Agent v6
kind: faq
---

Starting with v6.14.0, the Agent RPM packages are signed with a new GPG key.

The previous GPG key is over 4 years old, so to better follow security best practices we are rotating our key.

Hosts using RPM packages located in the [Datadog Yum repository][1] to install or upgrade the Agent v6.14.0+ are affected by this change and need to trust this new key by importing the associated public key in their hosts' keyrings.

Trying to install or upgrade the Agent package without trusting the new key results in `NOKEY` errors when installing the package.

The fingerprint of the associated public key is: `A4C0B90D7443CF6E4E8AA341F1068E14E09422B3`.

If you're using the latest version for one of the following officially supported install methods, then your hosts will automatically trust the new key and no further action is needed.

* Datadog [Chef cookbook][3]

* `Datadog.datadog` [Ansible role][4]

* Datadog Agent [Puppet module][5]

* Datadog [SaltStack formula][6]


## How to check if a host trusts the new GPG key

To check that a particular host does trust the new key, run this command on the host:
```bash
rpm -q gpg-pubkey-e09422b3
```

If the new key is trusted, the command has a 0 exit code and outputs:
```bash
gpg-pubkey-e09422b3-57744e9e
```

Otherwise, the command returns a non-0 exit code and the following output:
```bash
package gpg-pubkey-e09422b3 is not installed
```

## How to manually trust the new GPG key

To manually trust the new key, run the following command on the host:

```bash
rpm --import https://yum.datadoghq.com/DATADOG_RPM_KEY_E09422B3.public
```

Then check if the new key is trusted by following the steps in [How to check if a host trusts the new GPG key](#how-to-check-if-a-host-trusts-the-new-gpg-key).
