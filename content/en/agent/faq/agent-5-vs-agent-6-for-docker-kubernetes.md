In Datadog Agent 5, Docker and Kubernetes support relies on Python integrations: see the [Docker integration][1] and the [Kubernetes integration][2], respectively. Configuration happens partially in `datadog.conf`, and partially in the integration YAMLs.

In Agent 6, however, there are a few changes. For Docker, the configuration is found in `docker.d/conf.yaml`. For Kubernetes, configuration is partly in `datadog.yaml` and partly in `kubelet.d/conf.yaml`.

Both Agent 5 and Agent 6 have the following Python checks:

- [`kubernetes_state`][3], a Python Prometheus check that reaches a `kube-state-metrics` pod
- [`kube_dns`][4], for monitoring DNS metrics
- [`kube_proxy`][5], for metrics from `kube_proxy` states
