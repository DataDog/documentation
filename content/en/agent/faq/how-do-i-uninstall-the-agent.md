2. Drag the Datadog application from the application folder to the trash bin.
3. Run:

```
sudo rm -rf /opt/datadog-agent
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/datadog-agent
sudo rm -rf ~/.datadog-agent/**â€‹ #to remove broken symlinks
```
Then, reboot your machine for changes to take effect.

**It's important that the original account used to install the Agent is also used to remove it, otherwise it's possible remnants are left behind and it won't be cleanly removed.**
