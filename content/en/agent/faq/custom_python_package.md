Custom Python packages can be installed using the Agent's embedded Python using the following command in Powershell:

```
C:\"Program Files"\Datadog\"Datadog Agent"\embedded\python -m install <package_name>
```

Or the package can be added in the library zipped folder that can be found at 
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Datadog\Datadog Agent\files
```

then [restart your Agent][1].
