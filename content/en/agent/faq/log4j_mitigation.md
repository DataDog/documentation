If you are using the Datadog Agent between versions v7.17.0/v6.17.0 and v7.32.2/v6.32.2, you may be impacted by the vulnerability presented by Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046). If you are using an Agent earlier than v7.17.0/v6.17.0, you should not be impacted by the vulnerability unless you configured log4j to log with the JMS Appender (an option that is not supported by the Agent, but if you did it, disable the appender).

**The best way to mitigate the vulnerability is to upgrade your Datadog Agent to v7.32.3 (v6.32.3) or later.**

If you are not sure which version of the Agent you are using, read [Seeing if your Agent Version is vulnerable](#seeing-if-your-agent-version-is-vulnerable).

## Upgrading your Agent

To update the Datadog Agent core between two minor versions on your host or container, run the [install command for your platform][1].

## If you can't upgrade your Agent version

If you are not able to upgrade your Agent at this time, you can use these instructions either [delete the JndiLookup.class](#delete-jndilookupclass) or to [implement an environment variable](#set-log4j_format_msg_no_lookups-environment-variable) (`LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS="true"` on the JMXFetch process or the Agent process) to partially mitigate the vulnerability.

# Delete JndiLookup.class

**The best way to mitigate the vulnerability is to upgrade your Datadog Agent to v7.32.3 (v6.32.3) or later.**

Removing the JndiLookup.class [fully mitigates CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046][2].

**Note**: This mitigation is not needed for 7.32.3/6.32.3. In these versions, JMXFetch uses log4j v2.12.2, which is not affected by CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-44228.

### Linux and macOS

Save the following code as a bash script `jndi_cleanup.sh`, then run the script to patch the provided jmxfetch.jar in place.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

YUM_CMD=$(which yum)
APT_GET_CMD=$(which apt-get)

TARGET="/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar"
JNDI_CLASS="org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class"

set -e

VALIDATE=0
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
	case "$1" in
		-c)
			VALIDATE=1 ;;
		*)
			echo "$1 is not a supported option"
			exit 1 ;;
	esac
fi

if ! command -v zip &> /dev/null
then

	if [[ ! -z $YUM_CMD ]]; then
		yum install zip
	elif [[ ! -z $APT_GET_CMD ]]; then
		apt-get update
		apt-get -y install zip
	fi
fi

if [ $VALIDATE -eq 0 ]; then
	zip -q -d $TARGET $JNDI_CLASS
else
	if [ -z $(zip -sf /opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar  | grep -i jndilookup.class) ]; then
		echo "The $TARGET JAR is now safe to run.";
	else
		echo "The $TARGET JAR is not safe to run as it still contains $JNDI_CLASS!";
		exit 1;
	fi
fi

exit 0;

```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./jndi_cleanup.sh
```

Remove the JndiLogger.class from the jmxfetch.jar by running:

```bash
sudo ./jndi_cleanup.sh
```

Validate the JndiLogger.class was removed by running:

```bash
.\jndi_cleanup.sh -c
```

If the operation was successful the expected out is:

```
The C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\agent\dist\jmx\jmxfetch.jar is now safe to run.
```

Finally, restart the Datadog Agent service with `sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent` (Linux systemd-based systems), `sudo restart datadog-agent` (Linux upstart-based systems) or from the Datadog Agent app in the menu bar (macOS).

### Windows

Save the following PowerShell code as `jndi_cleanup.ps1`.

```powershell
Param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
    [Switch]$Validate

)

[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('System.IO.Compression')

$zipfile = "C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\agent\dist\jmx\jmxfetch.jar"
$files   = "JndiLookup.class"

$stream = New-Object IO.FileStream($zipfile, [IO.FileMode]::Open)
$update_mode   = [IO.Compression.ZipArchiveMode]::Update
$read_mode   = [IO.Compression.ZipArchiveMode]::Read

if ($Validate -eq $true) {
	$mode = $read_mode
} else {
	$mode = $update_mode
}

$zip    = New-Object IO.Compression.ZipArchive($stream, $mode)

if ($Validate -eq $true) {
	$found = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[System.Object]
	($zip.Entries | ? { $files -contains $_.Name }) | % { $found.Add($_.Name) }

    if ($found.Count -eq 0) {
        Write-Output "The $zipfile is now safe to run."
    } else {
        Write-Output "Dangerous file still present, something failed during the JNDI cleanup."
    }
} else {
	($zip.Entries | ? { $files -contains $_.Name }) | % { $_.Delete() }
}

$zip.Dispose()
$stream.Close()
$stream.Dispose()
```

From an **elevated** (run as admin) PowerShell, stop the Datadog Agent service before applying the patch:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" stopservice
```

Apply the patch to remove the JndiLogger.class from the jmxfetch.jar:

```powershell
.\jndi_cleanup.ps1
```

Validate the JndiLogger.class was removed by running:

```powershell
.\jndi_cleanup.ps1 -Validate
```

If the operation was successful the expected out is:

```
The C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\agent\dist\jmx\jmxfetch.jar is now safe to run.
```

Finally, start the Datadog Agent service to apply the changes.

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" start-service
```

### AIX

`Jmxfetch.jar` is included in the AIX agent install bundle, but there is no code in the AIX agent that runs the `jmxfetch` code. If you are not manually starting the `jmxfetch` process, the `jmxfetch.jar` is not used and can be deleted from `/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar`.

### Containerized ecosystems

If you are running the Datadog Agent as a container (such as in Kubernetes, Nomad or vanilla Docker), and use the JMX version (image name ends in `-jmx`), to remove the JndiLookup.class you will need to build a custom image of the Datadog Agent.

Use the following Dockerfile to build the custom image:

```
ARG AGENT_VERSION=7.32.2

FROM gcr.io/datadoghq/agent:$AGENT_VERSION-jmx

RUN apt update && apt install zip -y

RUN zip -q -d /opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class

RUN apt purge zip -y
```

From where the Dockerfile is located, proceed to build, tag and push the custom image to your Container Registry.
For example if you are running `7.21.1`:

```
docker build -t <Your_Container_Registry>/agent:7.21.1-jmx-patched --build-arg AGENT_VERSION=7.21.1 .
docker push <Your_Container_Registry>/agent:7.21.1-jmx-patched
```

Then use this patched image in your clusters.

NB: This only works for Linux and uses the architecture of the machine building the image. If you need to support multiple architectures, use dedicated machines or tools such as `Docker buildx`.


# Set LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS environment variable

**The best way to mitigate the vulnerability is to upgrade your Datadog Agent to v7.32.3 (v6.32.3) or later.**

**Note**: If you are running v7.32.2 or v6.32.2, you do not strictly need to perform these steps. The Agent v7.32.2 (and v6.32.2) [starts jmxfetch with a property][3] that achieves the same result. However, in all cases, the best option is to upgrade your Datadog Agent to v7.32.3 (v6.32.3) or later.

**Note**: Setting the `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` environment variable to `true` will reduce the risk of remote code execution but it is not a complete mitigation.

## Host installs

On Linux, the instructions depend on the init system and on the distribution:

### Systemd-based systems:

#### RedHat/CentOS 7 and 8; Amazon Linux 2; SUSE 12+; Ubuntu 16.04+/Debian 8+

1. Create an override file with the following contents at `/etc/systemd/system/datadog-agent.service.d/log4j_override.conf`:
    ```
    [Service]
    Environment="LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true"
    ```
2. Reload the systemd service definitions: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
3. Restart the datadog-agent service: `sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent`


### Upstart-based systems

Instructions are different depending on the Linux distribution:

#### Ubuntu 14.04

1. Create an override file with the following contents at `/etc/init/datadog-agent.override`:
    ```
    env LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true
    ```
2. Stop and start the datadog-agent service: `sudo stop datadog-agent && sudo start datadog-agent`

**Note**: Use `start` and `stop`, because `restart` does not pick up the service configuration change.

#### RedHat/Centos 6; Amazon Linux 1:

1. Add the following line at the end of the existing `/etc/init/datadog-agent.conf` file:
    ```
    env LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true
    ```
2. Stop and start the datadog-agent service: `sudo stop datadog-agent && sudo start datadog-agent`

**Note**: Use `start` and `stop`, because `restart` does not pick up the service configuration change.

**Note**: The `/etc/init/datadog-agent.conf` file is overwritten when the Agent is re-installed, upgraded, or downgraded, you must run these steps again if you upgrade, downgrade, or reinstall the Agent until you upgrade the Agent to v7.32.3/v6.32.3 or above.

### Windows

1. Run an administrator PowerShell on the machine.
2. Run the following snippet:
    ```
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS", "true", "Machine")
    ```
3. Restart the Datadog Agent service to apply the changes.

**Note**: This applies to all JVMs running on the host.

### AIX

`Jmxfetch.jar` is included in the AIX agent install bundle, but there is no code in the AIX agent that runs the `jmxfetch` code. If you are not manually starting the `jmxfetch` process, the `jmxfetch.jar` is not used and can be deleted from `/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch.jar`.

If you are manually running the `jmxfetch.jar`, pass the following flag to the Java process: `‚ÄêDlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True`


## Containerized Agent

**Note**: Setting the LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS environment variable to true will reduce the risk of remote code execution but it is not a complete mitigation.

### Docker (Linux and Windows)

Specify the following environment variable when running the datadog-agent container, by adding it to the `docker run` command: `-e LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS="true"`

### Kubernetes

Set the environment variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS="true"` on the `agent` container, or on all Datadog containers. With the official Datadog Helm chart, add the environment variable to the list under the `datadog.env` value, for example:

```
datadog:
  env:
    - name: "LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS"
      value: "true"
```

## Seeing if your Agent version is vulnerable

### With a dashboard

To see if your Datadog Agent (>= 6.17.0 - <= 6.32.2; >= 7.17.0 - <= 7.32.2) is the recommended version (6.32.3/7.32.3 or later) and not running on a Log4j vulnerable version, [import][4] the following dashboard template to your Datadog account:

[**Datadog Agent Version Check dashboard template**][5]
</br>
</br>
{{< img src="agent/faq/dashboard.png" alt="Datadog Agent Version Check dashboard showing vulnerable Agents" >}}

To create multiple version of this dashboard for multiple Datadog accounts or hosts, you can automate the creation process with the dashboards API. Run the following command in the directory where the JSON file is saved:

```curl
curl -X POST "https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/dashboard" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "DD-API-KEY: ${DD_API_KEY}" \
-H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: ${DD_APP_KEY}" \
-d @DatadogAgentVersionCheck.json
```

**Note**: The Datadog Agent Version Check dashboard does not show older versions of the Datadog Agent (v5), because those versions are not vulnerable.

### With the CLI

You can also check specific Agent version information with the Agent CLI `version` subcommand. For more information, see the [Agent CLI documentation][6].
