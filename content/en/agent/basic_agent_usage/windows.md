## Overview

This page outlines the basic features of the Datadog Agent for Windows. If you haven't installed the Agent yet, see the installation instructions below or [follow the instructions in the app][1].

## Install the Agent

### Requirements

- **Windows version**: Windows Server 2016 or later, or Windows 10 or later. See the Agent Supported Platforms documentation for [supported OS versions][2].
- **Datadog account**: Ensure you have access to a Datadog account and have your Datadog API key.
- **Administrator privileges**: Administrator access is required on the Windows machine.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Standard installation" %}}

The core and APM/trace components of the Windows Agent run under the `ddagentuser` account. The Live Processes component, if enabled, runs under the `LOCAL_SYSTEM` account. Learn more about the [Datadog Windows Agent User][3].

### Install with the GUI

1. Download the [Datadog Agent installer][4] to install the latest version of the Agent.
2. Run the installer by opening `datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi`. When prompted, enter your Administrator credentials.
3. Follow the prompts, accept the license agreement, and enter your [Datadog API key][5].

When the install finishes, you are given the option to launch the Datadog Agent Manager.

### Install with the command line

1. Open PowerShell with **Administrator** privileges.
2. Run the following command to install the Datadog Agent:
    ```powershell
    Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList '/qn /i datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi APIKEY="<YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY>"'
    ```

{{% tab "Installation in Active Directory Domains" %}}

When deploying the Datadog Agent in an Active Directory environment, Datadog recommends using a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA).

Using gMSA can enhance security and simplify management. Some of the benefits include:
- Deployment across multiple servers: Unlike traditional Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) or standalone Managed Service Accounts (sMSAs), gMSAs can be deployed across multiple servers.
- Automated password management: The passwords for gMSAs are handled at the operating system level, and are rotated on a regular basis without requiring manual intervention. 

When running with a gMSA, the core and APM/trace components of the Windows Agent run under the configured account. The Live Processes component, if enabled, runs under the `LOCAL_SYSTEM` account. Learn more about the [Datadog Windows Agent User][3].

### Prerequisites

- An Active Directory environment
- Permission to create and manage gMSAs
- See further [requirements in the Microsoft documentation][4].

**Note**: For a comprehensive understanding of setting up gMSAs, see [Microsoft's Group Managed Service Accounts Overview][5].

### Create and configure a gMSA

1. Create a Security Group:
   1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.
   2. Navigate to the appropriate **Organizational Unit (OU)**.
   3. Right-click and select **New** > **Group**.
   4. Name the group. For example, `DatadogAgentsGroup`.
   5. Set the correct group scope for your organization. For example, **Domain local**.
   6. Set the type to **Security**.


2. Create the gMSA:
   1. Open PowerShell with **Administrator** privileges.
   2. Run the following command to create the gMSA, replacing `<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>` with your domain name:
        ```powershell
        New-ADServiceAccount -Name DatadogGMSA -DNSHostName <YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME> -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword DatadogAgentsGroup
        ```


3. Verify that the gMSA can be used on the target machine:

   1. Ensure the target machine is part of the `DatadogAgentsGroup`.
   2. On the target machine, open PowerShell and run:
        ```powerhsell
        Install-ADServiceAccount -Identity DatadogGMSA
        ```
      Ensure the command ran without errors.

### Install the Agent

   <div class="alert alert-info">If you need to install a specific version of the Agent, see the <a href="https://ddagent-windows-stable.s3.amazonaws.com/installers_v2.json">installer list</a>.</div>

#### Install via the GUI

1. Download the [Datadog Agent installer][1] to install the latest version of the Agent.
2. Run the installer by opening `datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi`. When prompted, enter your Administrator credentials.
3. Follow the prompts, accept the license agreement, and enter your [Datadog API key][2].
4. When prompted for the "Datadog Agent User Account", enter the username of the gMSA. For example, `<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>\DatadogGMSA$` and **no password**.
When the install finishes, you are given the option to launch the Datadog Agent Manager.

#### Install with the command line

1. Open PowerShell with **Administrator** privileges.
2. Run the following command to install the Datadog Agent:

**Note:** Replace `DatadogGMSA$` with the username of your gMSA. The username **must end with a $ symbol.**
  ```powershell
  Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList '/qn /i datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi APIKEY="<YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY>" DDAGENTUSER_NAME="<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>\DatadogGMSA$'
  ```

**Notes**

- The `/qn` option runs a quiet install. To see the GUI prompts, remove it.
- Some Agent versions may cause a forced reboot. To prevent this, add the parameter: `REBOOT=ReallySuppress`.
- Some Agent components require a kernel driver to collect data. To know if a kernel driver is required for your component, see its documentation page or search for `kernel driver` in the associated Agent configuration files.
- If a valid `datadog.yaml` is found, that file takes precedence over all specified command line options.

#### More Agent configuration options

Each of the following configuration options can be added as a property to the command line when installing the Agent on Windows. 

**Note**: If a valid `datadog.yaml` is found, that file takes precedence over all specified command line options.

**Note:**
Agent 7 only supports Python 3. Before upgrading, confirm that your custom checks are compatible with Python 3. See the [Python 3 Custom Check Migration][13] guide for more information. If you're not using custom checks or have already confirmed their compatibility, upgrade normally.

If you're upgrading from a Datadog Agent version < 5.12.0, first upgrade to a more recent version of Agent 5 (>= 5.12.0 but < 6.0.0) using the [EXE installer][14] and then upgrade to Datadog Agent version >= 6.

#### Installation log files

You can find Agent installation log files at `%TEMP%\MSI*.LOG`.

#### Validation

To verify your installation, follow the instructions in the [Agent Status and Information](#agent-status-and-information) section.

## Agent commands

The execution of the Agent is controlled by the Windows Service Control Manager.

* The main executable name is `agent.exe`. The location is as follows depending on the Agent version:
	- Agent versions <= 6.11: `"C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\agent.exe"`
	- Agent versions >= 6.12: `"C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe"`
* The configuration GUI is a browser-based configuration application (for Windows 64-bit only).
* Commands can be run from the an **elevated(run as Admin)** command line (PowerShell or Command Prompt) using the syntax `<PATH_TO_AGENT.EXE> <COMMAND>`.

    "%ProgramFiles%\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" launch-gui
    "%ProgramFiles%\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" flare
    ```

## Configuration

Use the [Datadog Agent Manager][6] to enable, disable, and configure checks. Restart the Agent for your changes to be applied.


The main Agent configuration file is located at:
`C:\ProgramData\Datadog\datadog.yaml`

Configuration files for integrations are in:
`C:\ProgramData\Datadog\conf.d\` OR
`C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Datadog\conf.d\`

**Note**: `ProgramData` is a hidden folder.

## Uninstall the Agent

There are two different methods to uninstall the Agent on Windows. Both methods remove the Agent, but do not remove the `C:\ProgramData\Datadog` configuration folder on the host.

### Add or remove programs

1. Press **CTRL** and **Esc** or use the Windows key to run Windows Search.
1. Search for `add` and click **Add or remove programs**.
1. Search for `Datadog Agent` and click **Uninstall**.

### PowerShell

**Note:** Enable WinRM to use the commands below.

Use the following PowerShell command to uninstall the Agent without rebooting:

{{< code-block lang="powershell" >}}
$productCode = (@(Get-ChildItem -Path "HKLM:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall" -Recurse) | Where {$_.GetValue("DisplayName") -like "Datadog Agent" }).PSChildName
start-process msiexec -Wait -ArgumentList ('/log', 'C:\uninst.log', '/q', '/x', "$productCode", 'REBOOT=ReallySuppress')
{{< /code-block >}}

## Troubleshooting

### Agent status and information

To verify the Agent is running, check if the `DatadogAgent` service in the Services panel is listed as *Started*. A process called *Datadog Metrics Agent* (`agent.exe`) should also exist in the Task Manager.

To receive more information about the Agent's state, start the Datadog Agent Manager:

* Right click on the Datadog Agent system tray icon -> Configure, or
* Run `launch-gui` command from an **elevated(run as Admin)** command line
	- PowerShell: `& "<PATH_TO_AGENT.EXE>" launch-gui`
	- cmd: `"<PATH_TO_AGENT.EXE>" launch-gui`

Then, open the status page by going to *Status* -> *General*.
Get more information on running checks in *Status* -> *Collector* and *Checks* -> *Summary*.

The status command is available for PowerShell:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" status
```

or cmd.exe:

```cmd
"%ProgramFiles%\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" status
```

### Logs location

The Agent logs are located in `C:\ProgramData\Datadog\logs\agent.log`.

**Note**: `ProgramData` is a hidden folder.

### Send a flare

## Use cases

###  Monitoring a Windows service

On your target host, launch the Datadog Agent Manager and select the "Windows Service" integration from the list. There is an out-of-the-box example; however, this example uses DHCP.

To get the name of the service, open `services.msc` and locate your target service. Using DHCP as the target, you can see the service name at the top of the service properties window:

{{< img src="agent/faq/DHCP.png" alt="DHCP" style="width:75%;">}}

When adding your own services, be sure to follow the formatting exactly as shown. If formatting is not correct the integration fails. **Note**: Special characters in a service name must be escaped. For example, the name `MSSQL$BILLING` can be added with `MSSQL\$BILLING`.

Also, whenever you modify an integration, the Datadog service needs to be restarted. You can do this from services.msc or from the UI sidebar.

For Services, Datadog doesn't track the metrics—only their availability. (For metrics, use the [Process](#monitoring-windows-processes) or [WMI][7] integration). To set up a Monitor, select the [Integration monitor type][8] then search for **Windows Service**. From *Integration Status -> Pick Monitor Scope*, choose the service you would like to monitor.

### Monitoring system load for Windows

The Datadog Agent collects a large number of system metrics by default. The most commonly used system metrics are `system.load.*` but these metrics are **Unix** specific.

While Windows does not offer the `system.load.*` metrics, an equivalent option that's available by default is `system.proc.queue.length`. This metric shows the number of threads observed as delayed in the processor ready queue that are waiting to be executed.

### Monitoring Windows processes

You can monitor Windows processes with [Live Process Monitoring][9]. To enable this on Windows, edit the [Agent main configuration file][10] by setting the following parameter to true:

`datadog.yaml`:

```yaml
process_config:
  enabled: "true"
```

After configuration is complete, [restart the Agent][11].
