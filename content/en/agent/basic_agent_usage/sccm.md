Microsoft SCCM (Systems Center Configuration Manager) is a configuration management solution that comes packaged with Microsoft's Systems Center suite of tools. This page covers installing and configuring the Datadog Agent using SCCM.

## Prerequisites

- The Agent supports SCCM version 2103 or greater.
- Before you install the Agent, make sure you've installed and configured [Distribution Points][1] in Configuration Manager.

## Setup

### Create a deployable Datadog Agent application

1. Download the latest Windows Datadog Agent installer file (MSI) to the SCCM server from the [Agent page][2].
1. In SCCM, create an application and use the location of the Datadog Agent MSI.

1. Click **Next** until you get to the **General Information** page.
1. Under **Installation program**, paste the following command, replacing `MY_API_KEY` with your API key:

   ```powershell
   start /wait msiexec /qn /i datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi APIKEY="MY_API_KEY" SITE="datadoghq.com"
   ```

   For more installation options, see full list of [installation variables][3].

1. Ensure that **Install behavior** is set to **Install for system**.
1. Click **Next** and follow the prompts to create the application.

1. To verify the application has been created, look for it in **Software Library** > **Overview** > **Application Management** > **Applications**.

### Deploy the Datadog Agent application

<div class="alert alert-warning">Before deploying the Datadog Agent application, make sure you've installed and configured <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/install-and-configure-distribution-points">Distribution Points</a> in Configuration Manager</div>

1. Go to **Software Library** > **Overview** > **Application Management** > **Applications** and select the Datadog Agent application you created earlier.
1. From the **Home** tab in the **Deployment** group, select **Deploy**.

### Agent configuration

SCCM packages allow you to deploy configuration files to your Datadog Agents, overwriting their default settings. An Agent configuration consists of a `datadog.yaml` configuration file and optional `conf.yaml` files for each integration. You must create a package for each configuration file you want to deploy.

1. Collect your `datadog.yaml` and `conf.yaml` files in a local SCCM machine folder. See the [sample `config_template.yaml` file][4] for all available configuration options.
1. Create an SCCM Package and select **Standard program**.
1. Select the location that contains the configuration file that you want to deploy to your Agents.
1. Select a [Device collection][5] to deploy the changes to.
1. Configure deployment settings to pre-install the package on the targets immediately.

### Restart the Datadog Agent

Restart the Agent service to observe your configuration changes:
1. Create a PowerShell script to restart the Datadog Agent using [Agent commands][6].
1. Run the script to restart the Datadog Agent.
1. Check for new data in the Datadog UI.
