## Overview

This page outlines the basic features of the Datadog Agent for macOS.

See the [Supported Platforms][5] documentation for the complete list of supported macOS distributions and versions.

## Install the Agent 
To install the Agent on macOS, follow the [in-app instructions in Fleet Automation][6], and run the generated script on your hosts.

{{< img src="/agent/basic_agent_usage/macos_img_installation.png" alt="In-app installation steps for the Datadog Agent on a MacOS host." style="width:90%;">}}

<div class="alert alert-info">
By default, the Agent is installed in a sandbox located at <code>/opt/datadog-agent</code>. You can move this folder anywhere; however, this documentation assumes a default installation location.
</div>


## Commands

The `launchctl` service manager controls the Agent lifecycle, while other commands can be executed through the Agent binary, systray app, or web GUI.


| Description          | Command          |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Start Agent as a service           | `launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent` or systray app |
| Stop Agent running as a service    | `launchctl stop com.datadoghq.agent` or systray app  |
| Restart Agent running as a service | Stop and then start the Agent with:<br>`launchctl stop com.datadoghq.agent`<br>`launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent`<br>Or use the systray app |
| Status of Agent service            | `launchctl list com.datadoghq.agent` or systray app  |
| Status page of running Agent       | `datadog-agent status` or web GUI                    |
| Send flare                         | `datadog-agent flare` or web GUI                     |
| Display command usage              | `datadog-agent --help`                               |
| Run a check                        | `datadog-agent check <CHECK_NAME>`                   |


## Configuration

The [Datadog Agent configuration file][7] is located in `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`. This YAML file holds the host-wide connection details used to send data to Datadog including:

- `api_key`: your organization's [Datadog API key][8] 
- `site`: target Datadog region (for example `datadoghq.com`, `datadoghq.eu`, `ddog-gov.com`)  
- `proxy`: HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoints for outbound traffic (see [Datadog Agent Proxy Configuration][9])  
- Default tags, log levels, and Datadog configurations.

A fully commented reference file, located in `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml.example`, lists every available option for comparison or copy-paste. Alternatively, see the [sample config_template.yaml file][10] for all available configuration options.

### Integration files
Configuration files for integrations are found in `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/`. Each integration has its own sub-directory, `<INTEGRATION>.d/`, which contains:
- `conf.yaml`: the active configuration controlling how the integration gathers metrics and logs  
-  `conf.yaml.example`: a sample illustrating supported keys and defaults



## Uninstall the Agent

To uninstall the Agent, run the following command:

## Troubleshooting

See the [Agent Troubleshooting documentation][2] for troubleshooting steps.

## Working with the embedded Agent

The Agent contains an embedded Python environment at `/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/`. Common binaries such as `python` and `pip` are contained within `/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/`.

See the instructions on how to [add packages to the embedded Agent][3] for more information.
