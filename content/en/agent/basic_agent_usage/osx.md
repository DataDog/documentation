## Overview

This page outlines the basic features of the Datadog Agent for macOS. If you haven't installed the Agent yet, instructions can be found in the [Datadog Agent Integration][1] documentation.

By default, the Agent is installed in a sandbox located at `/opt/datadog-agent`. You can move this folder wherever you like; however, this documentation assumes a default installation location.

**Note**: macOS 10.12 and above are supported by the Agent v6, macOS 10.10 and above by the Agent v5.

## Commands

In Agent v6 and v7, the `launchctl` service manager provided by the operating system is responsible for the Agent lifecycle, while other commands must be run via the Agent binary directly. Alternatively, lifecycle commands can also be managed via the systray app, and other commands can be executed via the web GUI.

## Working with the embedded Agent

The Agent contains an embedded Python environment at `/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/`. Common binaries such as `python` and `pip` are contained within `/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/`.

See the instructions on how to [add packages to the embedded Agent][3] for more information.
