## Overview

This page outlines the basic features of the Datadog Agent for Linux environments. See [Supported Platforms][5] for the complete list of supported Linux distributions and versions. 

## Install the Agent
To install the Agent on Linux, follow the [in-app instructions in Fleet Automation][6], and run the generated script on your hosts.

## Configure the Agent
The Datadog Agent configuration file is located in `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`. This YAML file holds the host-wide connection details used to send data to Datadog including:
- `api_key`: Your organizationâ€™s [Datadog API key][7] 
- `site`: Target Datadog region (`datadoghq.com`, `datadoghq.eu`, `us3.datadoghq.com`, `us5.datadoghq.com`, `ddog-gov.com`)  
- `proxy`: HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoints for outbound traffic (see [Datadog Agent Proxy Configuration][8])  
- Default tags, log level, and Datadog product configurations.

A fully commented reference file, located in `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml.example`, lists every available option for comparison or to copy and paste. Alternatively, see the sample `config_template.yaml` file for all available configuration options.

### Integration Files
Configuration files for integrations live in `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/`. Each integration has its own sub-directory, `<INTEGRATION>.d/`, that contains:
- `conf.yaml`: The active configuration controlling how the integration gathers metrics and logs  
- `conf.yaml.example`: A sample illustrating supported keys and defaults



## Commands

| Description   | Command               |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Start Agent as a service           | `sudo systemctl start datadog-agent`                   |
| Stop Agent running as a service    | `sudo systemctl stop datadog-agent`                    |
| Restart Agent running as a service | `sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent`                 |
| Status of Agent service            | `sudo systemctl status datadog-agent`                  |
| Status page of running Agent       | `sudo datadog-agent status`                            |
| Send flare                         | `sudo datadog-agent flare`                             |
| Display command usage              | `sudo datadog-agent --help`                            |
| Run a check                        | `sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent check <CHECK_NAME>` |

**Note:** For upstart-based systems, such as `CentOS/RHEL 6` or `SUSE 11`, swap `systemctl <action>` with just `<action>`. For example, when starting an Agent as a service on a `SUSE 11` system, use `sudo start datadog-agent`.


## Uninstall the Agent

To uninstall the Agent, run the command for the appropriate Linux environment.


### For CentOS, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, and Red Hat

```shell
sudo yum remove datadog-agent
```

### For Debian, Ubuntu
```shell
sudo apt-get remove datadog-agent -y
```

### For SUSE
```shell
sudo zypper remove datadog-agent
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

**The above commands remove the Agent, but do not remove**:
* The `datadog.yaml` configuration file
* User-created files in the `/etc/datadog-agent` configuration folder
* User-created files in the `/opt/datadog-agent` folder
* The `dd-agent` user
* Datadog log files

**If you also want to remove these elements, run this command after removing the Agent:**
```shell
sudo userdel dd-agent \
&& sudo rm -rf /opt/datadog-agent/ \
&& sudo rm -rf /etc/datadog-agent/ \
&& sudo rm -rf /var/log/datadog/
```

**Note:** To uninstall remaining Agent artifacts for `Debian` and `Ubuntu` run:

```shell
sudo apt-get remove --purge datadog-agent -y
```

</div>


### Uninstall Single Step APM Instrumentation
If you installed the Agent with Single Step APM Instrumentation, and you want to uninstall the Agent, you need to run additional commands to uninstall APM Instrumentation.


## Troubleshooting

See the [Agent Troubleshooting documentation][2] for troubleshooting steps.

## Working with the embedded Agent

The Agent contains an embedded Python environment at `/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/`. Common binaries such as `python` and `pip` are contained within `/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/`.

See the instructions on how to [add packages to the embedded Agent][3] for more information.
