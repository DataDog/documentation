## Data collected

### Metrics

Amazon ECS metrics collected with the Datadog Agent:

{{< get-metrics-from-git "amazon_ecs" "ecs." >}}

**Note**: Metrics prefixed with `ecs.containerinsights.*` come from the [AWS CloudWatch agent][1].

### Events

To reduce noise, the Amazon ECS integration is automatically set up to include only events that contain the following words: `drain`, `error`, `fail`, `insufficient memory`, `pending`, `reboot`, `terminate`. See example events below:

{{< img src="integrations/amazon_ecs/aws_ecs_events.png" alt="AWS ECS Events" >}}

To remove the whitelist and receive all events from your Datadog Amazon ECS integration, reach out to [Datadog support][2].
