## Overview

Community developed integrations for the Datadog Agent are stored in the Datadog [integrations-extra][1] GitHub repository. They are not packaged with the Agent, but can be installed as add-ons.

## Setup

For new users, download and install the latest version of the [Datadog Agent][2].

### Installation

Choose your version of the Agent:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+" %}}

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+:

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

    ```
    datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-<INTEGRATION_NAME>==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
    ```
   The version for the integration can be found in the respective changelog on the integration's Github repository
2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][1].
3. [Restart the Agent][2].

**Note**: If necessary, prepend `sudo -u dd-agent` to the install command.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Docker" %}}

The recommended way to use a community integration with the Docker Agent is to build the Agent with the integration installed. Use the following Dockerfile to build an updated version of the Agent that includes the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` from integrations-extras.

```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/datadoghq/agent:latest
RUN datadog-agent integration install -r -t datadog-<INTEGRATION_NAME>==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
```

The `agent integration install` command run inside Docker issues the following harmless warning: `Error loading config: Config File "datadog" Not Found in "[/etc/datadog-agent]": warn`. This warning can be ignored.

Use this new Agent image in combination with [Autodiscovery][1] to enable the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>`.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Agent earlier versions" %}}

For Agent < v7.21 / v6.21:

1. Download the files in the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>/datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION_NAME>/` folder from the [integrations-extra repository][1].
2. Place `<INTEGRATION_NAME>.py` and any other Python files in the Agent's `checks.d` directory.
3. Create a new `<INTEGRATION_NAME>.d/` folder in your [Agent configuration directory][2].
4. Place the `conf.yaml.example` file from the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>/datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION_NAME>/data/` folder in the created directory.
4. Rename this file to `conf.yaml`.
5. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][3].
6. [Restart the Agent][4].

If your site restricts network access, ensure you have added all of the [`ip-ranges`][3] to your inclusion list, or download the integration manually.
