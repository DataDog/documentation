## Overview

The Datadog Agent v6 Manager GUI is browser-based. The port the GUI runs on can be configured in your `datadog.yaml` file. Setting the port to `-1` disables the GUI. By default it is enabled on port 5002 for Windows and Mac and is disabled on Linux.

### Requirements

1. Cookies must be enabled in your browser. The GUI generates and saves a token in your browser which is used for authenticating all communications with the GUI server.

2. The GUI is only launched if the user launching it has the correct user permissions. If you are able to open `datadog.yaml`, you are able to use the GUI.

3. For security reasons, the GUI can only be accessed from the local network interface (localhost/127.0.0.1), so you must be on the same host that the Agent is running to use it. In other words, you can't run the Agent on a VM or container and access it from the host machine.

### Start the Datadog Agent Manager

After the Agent is [installed][1] on your Windows host, start the Datadog Agent Manager to manage the Agent graphically.

From the Windows start menu:

* Click on the Datadog folder.
* Right click on Datadog Agent Manager.
* Choose `Run as Administrator`.

From an elevated Powershell prompt:

```powershell
& "%PROGRAMFILES%\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\agent.exe" launch-gui
```

The Datadog Agent Manager launches in your default web browser. The web address is `http://127.0.0.1:5002`.

The following sections provide information on the options in the left navigation bar.

### Settings

The settings page displays the contents of the Agent's main configuration file `datadog.yaml`. You can edit this file directly from the Datadog Agent Manager. After making a change, click **Save** in the upper right then [restart the Agent](#restart-agent).

See the [sample config_template.yaml][2] for all available configuration options.

### Checks

#### Manage checks

The manage checks page displays the contents of enabled check configuration files. You can edit these files directly from the Datadog Agent Manager. After making a change, click **Save** in the upper right then [restart the Agent](#restart-agent).

To add a check, select **Add a Check** in the drop-down. This displays a list of available checks to install. Reference the specific check's [integration][3] page for configuration details.

#### Checks summary

The checks summary page displays a list of the checks running, number of instances for each check, and the check's status.

### Flare

If you are having issues with the Agent, the flare page assists you with troubleshooting with the [Datadog support][4] team. Enter your ticket number (optional) and email address then click **Submit**. This transmits a copy of your Agent logs and config files to Datadog support. More information on flares is available in the [Agent Flare][5] documentation.

### Restart Agent

Clicking **Restart Agent** from the left navigation bar restarts the Agent immediately. There is no page or confirmation prompt. After restarting the Agent, you are forwarded to the [general status](#general) page.
