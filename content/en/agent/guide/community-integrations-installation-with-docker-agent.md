Community developed integrations for the Datadog Agent are stored in the [Integrations-extra][1] Github repository. They are not packaged and built into the Datadog Agent, but can be installed as add-ons by following these instructions:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Agent above v6.8" %}}

To install the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` check on your host:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][1].
2. Clone the integrations-extras repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras.git.
    ```

3. Update your `ddev` config with the `integrations-extras/` path:

    ```
    ddev config set extras ./integrations-extras
    ```

4. To build the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` package, run:

    ```
    ddev -e release build <INTEGRATION_NAME>
    ```

5. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][2].
6. Run the following command to install the integrations wheel with the Agent:

    ```
    datadog-agent integration install -w <PATH_OF_INTEGRATION_NAME_PACKAGE>/<ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl
    ```

7. Configure your integration like [any other packaged integration][3].
8. [Restart the Agent][4].

{{% tab "Docker" %}}

The best way to use an integration from integrations-extra with the Docker Agent is to build the Agent with this integration installed. Use the following Dockerfile to build an updated version of the Agent that includes the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` integration from integrations-extras.

```text
FROM python:3.8 AS wheel_builder
WORKDIR /wheels
RUN pip install "datadog-checks-dev[cli]"
RUN git clone https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras.git
RUN ddev config set extras ./integrations-extras
RUN ddev -e release build <INTEGRATION_NAME>

FROM datadog/agent:latest
COPY --from=wheel_builder /wheels/integrations-extras/<INTEGRATION_NAME>/dist/ /dist
RUN agent -c /etc/datadog-agent/datadog-docker.yaml integration install -r -w /dist/*.whl
```

Then use this new Agent image in combination with [Autodiscovery][1] in order to enable the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` check.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Agent prior to 6.8" %}}

To install the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` check on your host:

1. [Download the Datadog Agent][1] on your host.
2. Download the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>.py` file in the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>/datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION_NAME>/` folder from the [integrations-extra repository][2]
3. Place it in the Agent's `checks.d` directory.
4. Download the `conf.yaml.example` file in the `<INTEGRATION_NAME>/datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION_NAME>/data/` folder from the [integrations-extra repository][2]
5. Rename this file into `conf.yaml`.
6. Create a new `<INTEGRATION_NAME>.d/` folder in your [Agent configuration directory][3].
7. Place the `conf.yaml` file in the directory created in step 6.
8. Configure your integration like [any other packaged integration][4].
9. [Restart the Agent][5].
