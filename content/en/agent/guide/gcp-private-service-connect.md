[Private Service Connect][1] (PSC) allows you to send telemetry to Datadog without using the public internet.

Datadog exposes some of its data intake services in Google Cloud Platform as PSC [_published services_][2], as seen in the [table of published services](#published-services). 

You can configure a GCP PSC endpoint to expose a private IP address for each Datadog intake service; this IP address routes traffic to the Datadog backend. You can then configures a GCP [_Private DNS Zone_][3] to override the DNS names corresponding to the products for each endpoint that is consumed.

## Setup

### Connect an endpoint

1. In your GCP console, navigate to **Network services** > **Private Service Connect**.
2. Go to the **Endpoints** section. Click on **Connect endpoint**.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/connect-endpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of a 'Connect endpoint' page in the GCP console" >}}
   
   - Under **Target**, select _Published service_.
   - For **Target service**, enter the _PSC target name_ that corresponds to the Datadog intake service that you want to use. You can find your PSC target name in the [table of published services](#published-services).
   - For **Endpoint name**, enter a unique identifier to use for this endpoint. You can use `datadog-<SERVICE>`. For example: `datadog-metrics`.
   - For **Network** and **Subnetwork**, choose the network and subnetwork where you want to publish your endpoint.
   - For **IP address**, click the dropdown and select _Create IP address_ to create an internal IP from your subnet dedicated to the endpoint. Select this IP.
   - Check **Enable global access** if you intend to connect the endpoint to virtual machines outside of the `us-central1` region.

   **Note**: Datadog exposes PSC producer endpoints from the `us-central1` region. These endpoints support global access, allowing services to connect from any region. However, the forwarding rule must be created in the `us-central1` region.

3. Click **Add endpoint**. Verify that your status is _Accepted_. Take note of the IP address, as this is used in the next section.

### Create a DNS zone
1. In your GCP console, navigate to **Network services** > **Cloud DNS**.
2. Click on **Create zone**.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/create-a-dns-zone.png" alt="Screenshot of a 'Create a DNS zone' page in the GCP console" >}}

   - Under **Zone type**, select _Private_.
   - For **Zone name**, enter a descriptive name for your zone.
   - For **DNS name**, enter the _private DNS name_ that corresponds to the Datadog intake service that you want to use. You can find your DNS name in the [table of published services](#published-services).
3. Next, create an `A` record that points to the endpoint IP. On the _Zone details_ page of the zone you created, click on **Add record set**.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/create-record.png" alt="Screenshot of the 'Create record set' page in the GCP console." >}}

   - For **DNS name**, leave the field unmodified.
   - For **Resource record type**, select `A`.
   - Under **IPv4 Address**, enter the IP address that was displayed at the end of the previous section.

### Additional required steps for metrics and traces

To set up DNS for the metrics or traces endpoint (`metrics.agent.`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} or `trace.agent.`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}), you must create additional `A` records.
This is because Datadog Agents submit telemetry using a versioned endpoint of the form `<VERSION>-app.agent.`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}. 

#### Metrics endpoint

After completing the setup steps for the metrics endpoint, follow the [connect an endpoint](#connect-an-endpoint) steps for the _traces_ endpoint. Take note of the IP address of this endpoint.

Then, in the DNS zone you created for the metrics endpoint, add the following two records:

| DNS name | Resource record type | IPv4 address |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `*`      | A                    | IP address for your metrics endpoint |
| `trace`  | A                    | IP address for your traces endpoint |

#### Traces endpoint

After completing the setup steps for the traces endpoint, follow the [connect an endpoint](#connect-an-endpoint) steps for the _metrics_ endpoint. Take note of the IP address of this endpoint.

Then, in the DNS zone you created for the traces endpoint, add the following two records:

| DNS name | Resource record type | IPv4 address |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `*`      | A                    | IP address for your traces endpoint |
| `metrics`  | A                    | IP address for your metrics endpoint |

### Validation

To verify your configuration, SSH into one of your local nodes and run a `dig` command similar to the following:

```shell
> dig +noall +answer 7-49-0-app.agent.us5.datadoghq.com
```

The response resembles:
```
7-49-0-app.agent.us5.datadoghq.com. 300 IN A        10.1.0.4
```

Ensure that the IP address in the response matches the one associated with your PSC target.

## Setup

### Connect an endpoint

1. In your GCP console, navigate to **Network services** > **Private Service Connect**.
2. Go to the **Endpoints** section. Click on **Connect endpoint**.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/connect-endpoint-eu.png" alt="Screenshot of a 'Connect endpoint' page in the GCP console" >}}
   
   - Under **Target**, select _Published service_.
   - For **Target service**, enter the _PSC target name_ that corresponds to the Datadog intake service that you want to use. You can find your PSC target name in the [table of published services](#published-services).
   - For **Endpoint name**, enter a unique identifier to use for this endpoint. You can use `datadog-<SERVICE>`. For example: `datadog-metrics`.
   - For **Network** and **Subnetwork**, choose the network and subnetwork where you want to publish your endpoint.
   - For **IP address**, click the dropdown and select _Create IP address_ to create an internal IP from your subnet dedicated to the endpoint. Select this IP.
   - Check **Enable global access** if you intend to connect the endpoint to virtual machines outside of the `europe-west3` region.

   **Note**: Datadog exposes PSC producer endpoints from the `europe-west3` region. These endpoints support global access, allowing services to connect from any region. However, the forwarding rule must be created in the `europe-west3` region.

3. Click **Add endpoint**. Verify that your status is _Accepted_. Take note of the IP address, as this is used in the next section.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/connect-endpoint-success-eu.png" alt="Screenshot of a success message after adding an endpoint in the GCP console. Includes an IP address" >}}

### Create a DNS zone
1. In your GCP console, navigate to **Network services** > **Cloud DNS**.
2. Click on **Create zone**.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/create-a-dns-zone-eu.png" alt="Screenshot of a 'Create a DNS zone' page in the GCP console" >}}

   - Under **Zone type**, select _Private_.
   - For **Zone name**, enter a descriptive name for your zone.
   - For **DNS name**, enter the _private DNS name_ that corresponds to the Datadog intake service that you want to use. You can find your DNS name in the [table of published services](#published-services).
3. Next, create an `A` record that points to the endpoint IP. On the _Zone details_ page of the zone you created, click on **Add record set**.
   {{< img src="agent/guide/psc/create-record-eu.png" alt="Screenshot of the 'Create record set' page in the GCP console." >}}

   - For **DNS name**, leave the field unmodified.
   - For **Resource record type**, select `A`.
   - Under **IPv4 Address**, enter the IP address that was displayed at the end of the previous section.

### Additional required steps for metrics and traces

To set up DNS for the metrics or traces endpoint (`metrics.agent.`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} or `trace.agent.`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}), you must create additional `A` records.
This is because Datadog Agents submit telemetry using a versioned endpoint of the form `<VERSION>-app.agent.`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}. 

#### Metrics endpoint

After completing the setup steps for the metrics endpoint, follow the [connect an endpoint](#connect-an-endpoint) steps for the _traces_ endpoint. Take note of the IP address of this endpoint.

Then, in the DNS zone you created for the metrics endpoint, add the following two records:

| DNS name | Resource record type | IPv4 address |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `*`      | A                    | IP address for your metrics endpoint |
| `trace`  | A                    | IP address for your traces endpoint |

#### Traces endpoint

After completing the setup steps for the traces endpoint, follow the [connect an endpoint](#connect-an-endpoint) steps for the _metrics_ endpoint. Take note of the IP address of this endpoint.

Then, in the DNS zone you created for the traces endpoint, add the following two records:

| DNS name | Resource record type | IPv4 address |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `*`      | A                    | IP address for your traces endpoint |
| `metrics`  | A                    | IP address for your metrics endpoint |

### Validation

To verify your configuration, SSH into one of your local nodes and run a `dig` command similar to the following:

```shell
> dig +noall +answer  7-49-0-app.agent.datadoghq.eu
```

The response resembles:
```
7-49-0-app.agent.datadoghq.eu. 300 IN A        10.3.0.7
```

Ensure that the IP address in the response matches the one associated with your PSC target.
