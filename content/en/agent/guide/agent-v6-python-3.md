Starting with v6.14.0, the Agent v6 integrates both Python 2 and Python 3 runtimes. This means that Agent Checks can be run either with Python 2 or Python 3, depending on the Agent configuration.

By default, the Agent v6 uses the Python 2 runtime. To switch to the Python 3 runtime:

{{% tab "Host Agent" %}}

1. Set the `python_version` configuration option [in your `datadog.yaml` configuration file][1]:

    ```yaml
    python_version: 3
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][2].

Alternatively, the `DD_PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable can be set to `2` or `3` to choose which Python runtime is used. If it is set, the `python_version` option in `datadog.yaml` is ignored.

This is an Agent-wide configuration option: **all Python checks launched by an Agent use the same Python runtime**.

Since the only change between Agent v6.x and Agent v7.x is that the Agent v7.x includes the Python 3 runtime, contrary to Agent v6.x which includes only the Python 2 runtime, you can switch Python runtimes by switching Agent versions. To switch from one Python runtime to another, choose the appropriate Agent image:

* **Python 2** runtime: Agent v6 images have the following format: `datadog/agent:6.<AGENT_MINOR_VERSION>`, or `datadog/agent:6.<AGENT_MINOR_VERSION>-jmx` for images supporting JMX checks.

* **Python 3** runtime: Agent v7 images have the following format: `datadog/agent:7.<AGENT_MINOR_VERSION>`, or `datadog/agent:7.<AGENT_MINOR_VERSION>-jmx` for images supporting JMX checks.
