The Agent v6 status page displays information about your running Agent. See [Agent Commands][1] to find the status command for your environment. The sections below provide details on the contents of the status page.

**Note**: The status page may have minor differences between Agent versions.

## Agent version

General information for Agent is displayed under the Agent version, for example:
```text
  Status date: 2019-08-29 18:16:41.526203 UTC
  Agent start: 2019-08-29 18:04:18.060507 UTC
  Pid: 12141
  Go Version: go1.11.5
  Python Version: 2.7.16
  Check Runners: 4
  Log Level: info
```

### Paths

This section displays the paths to the Datadog config file, `conf.d` directory, and `checks.d` directory, for example:
```text
    Config File: /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
    conf.d: /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d
    checks.d: /etc/datadog-agent/checks.d
```

### Clocks

This section displays the [NTP offset][2] and system UTC time, for example:
```text
    NTP offset: 2.095ms
    System UTC time: 2019-08-29 18:16:41.526203 UTC
```

### Host info

This section displays information on the host the Agent is running on, for example:
```text
    bootTime: 2019-08-29 18:01:27.000000 UTC
    kernelVersion: 4.4.0-109-generic
    os: linux
    platform: ubuntu

### Hostnames

This section displays the hostnames found by the Agent (see the example below). The `hostname` is the final hostname reported to the backend. For more information, see [How does Datadog determine the Agent hostname][3].

```text
    hostname: ubuntu-xenial
    socket-fqdn: ubuntu-xenial
    socket-hostname: ubuntu-xenial
    hostname provider: os
    unused hostname providers:
      aws: not retrieving hostname from AWS: the host is not an ECS instance, and other providers already retrieve non-default hostnames
      configuration/environment: hostname is empty
      gce: unable to retrieve hostname from GCE: Get http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/hostname: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
```

### Config errors

This section only displays if there are checks with config errors, for example:

```text
    test
    ----
      Configuration file contains no valid instances
```

### Loading errors

This section only displays if there are checks with loading errors, for example:

```text
    test
    ----
      Core Check Loader:
        Check test not found in Catalog

      JMX Check Loader:
        check is not a jmx check, or unable to determine if it's so

      Python Check Loader:
        unable to import module 'test': No module named test
```

## JMXFetch

This section displays a list of initialized and failed JMX checks even if there are no checks, for example:

```text
  Initialized checks
  ==================
    no checks

  Failed checks
  =============

```

## Forwarder

The forwarder uses a number of workers to send payloads to Datadog.

If you see the warning `the forwarder dropped transactions, there is probably an issue with your network`, this means that all the workers were busy. You should review your network performance and tune the `forwarder_num_workers` and `forwarder_timeout` options.

### Transactions

This section displays the transactions made by the forwarder, for example:

```text
    CheckRunsV1: 2
    Dropped: 0
    DroppedOnInput: 0
    Events: 0
    HostMetadata: 0
    IntakeV1: 2
    Metadata: 0
