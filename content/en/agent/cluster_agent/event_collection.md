If you haven't yet, review the [setup instructions to install the Datadog Cluster Agent][1] and enable event collection.

1. Disable leader election in your Datadog Node Agent Daemonset by setting the `leader_election` variable or `DD_LEADER_ELECTION` environment variable to `false`.

2. In your Cluster Agent deployment file, set the `DD_COLLECT_KUBERNETES_EVENTS` and `DD_LEADER_ELECTION` environment variable to `true`:

      ```yaml
        - name: DD_COLLECT_KUBERNETES_EVENTS
          value: "true"
        - name: DD_LEADER_ELECTION
          value: "true"
      ```

Enabling the leader election in this way ensures that only one Cluster Agent collects the events.
