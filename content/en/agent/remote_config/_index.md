## Overview
Remote Configuration is a Datadog capability that allows you to remotely configure and change the behavior of Datadog components (for example, Agents, tracing libraries, and Observability Pipelines Worker) deployed in your infrastructure, for select product features. Use Remote Configuration to apply configurations to Datadog components in your environment on demand, decreasing management costs, reducing friction between teams, and accelerating issue resolution times.

For Datadog security products, Application Security Management and Cloud Security Management Threats (CSM Threats), Remote Configuration-enabled Agents and compatible tracing libraries provide real-time security updates and responses, enhancing security posture for your applications and cloud infrastructure.

## How it works
When Remote Configuration is enabled on the Datadog Agent, it periodically polls the configured [Datadog site][1], to determine whether there are configuration changes to apply to your Remote Configuration-enabled Agents or tracing libraries.

After you submit configuration changes in the respective Datadog product UI for a Remote Configuration-enabled product feature, the changes are stored in Datadog.

The following diagram illustrates how Remote Configuration works:

{{<img src="agent/remote_config/RC_Diagram_v5.png" alt="Users configure features in the UI, the config is stored in Datadog, the Agent requests config updates." width="90%" style="center">}}

1. You configure select product features in the Datadog UI.
2. The product feature configurations are securely stored within Datadog.
3. Agents in your environments securely poll, receive, and automatically apply configuration updates from Datadog. Tracing libraries, deployed in your environments, communicate with Agents to request and receive configuration updates from Datadog.

**Note**: Configuration changes applied through Remote Configuration are not shown in your Agent configuration file.

## Supported products and feature capabilities
The following products and features are supported with Remote Configuration:

### Application Security Management (ASM)

- **1-click ASM activation**: Enable ASM in 1-click from the Datadog UI.
- **In-App attack patterns updates**: Receive the newest Web Application Firewall (WAF) attack patterns automatically as Datadog releases them, following newly disclosed vulnerabilities or attack vectors.
- **Protect**: Block attackers' IPs, authenticated users, and suspicious requests that are flagged in ASM Security Signals and Traces temporarily or permanently through the Datadog UI.

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

- **Configuration at runtime** (Beta): Change a service's trace sampling rate, Log Injection enablement, and HTTP header tags from within the Service Catalog UI, without having to restart the service. Read [Configuration at Runtime][22] for more information.
- **Remotely set Agent sampling rate** (Public Beta): Remotely configure the Datadog Agent to change its trace sampling rates and set rules to scale your organization's trace ingestion according to your needs, without needing to restart your Datadog Agent.


### Dynamic Instrumentation

- Send critical metrics, traces, and logs from your live applications with no code changes.

### CSM Threats

<div class="alert alert-info">Remote Configuration for default Agent rules is in beta.</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">Remote Configuration for custom rules is in private beta. Fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5Emr7y_Jg3ShcC44HlYtalxKgHUocFAz8dq87xSkjfeALTg/viewform">form</a> to request access.</div>

- **Automatic default Agent rule updates**: Automatically receive and update the default Agent rules maintained by Datadog as new Agent detections and enhancements are released. See [Setting Up CSM Threats][3] for more information.
- **Automatic deployment of custom Agent rules**: Automatically deploy your custom Agent rules to designated hosts (all hosts or a defined subset of hosts).

### Observability Pipelines
<div class="alert alert-info">This feature is in public beta.</div>

- **Remotely deploy and update [Observability Pipelines Workers][4] (OPW)**: Build and edit pipelines in the Datadog UI, rolling out your configuration changes to OPW instances running in your environment.

## Security considerations

Datadog implements the following safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of configurations received and applied by your Datadog components:

* Agents deployed in your infrastructure request configurations from Datadog.
* Datadog never sends configurations unless requested by Agents, and only sends configurations relevant to the requesting Agent.
* Because the configuration requests are initiated from your Agents to Datadog over HTTPS (port 443), there is no need to open additional ports in your network firewall.
* The communication between your Agents and Datadog is encrypted using HTTPS, and is authenticated and authorized using your Datadog API key.
* Only users with the [`api_keys_write`][5] permissions are authorized to enable or disable Remote Configuration capability on the API key and use the supported product features.
* Your configuration changes submitted through the Datadog UI are signed and validated on the Agent and requesting Datadog components, verifying integrity of the configuration.

## Enabling Remote Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Datadog Agent version `7.41.1`  (`7.42.0` for APM sampling rate, `7.43.0` for APM Remote Instrumentation) or higher installed on your hosts or containers. 
- For Datadog products that use tracing libraries, you also need to upgrade your tracing libraries to a Remote Configuration-compatible version. For ASM Protection capabilities and ASM 1-click activation, see [ASM compatibility requirements][6]. For Dynamic Instrumentation, see [Dynamic Instrumentation prerequisites][20].

### Setup

To enable Remote Configuration:

1. Ensure your RBAC permissions include [`org_management`][7], so you can enable Remote Configuration for your organization.

2. Ensure your RBAC permissions include [`api_keys_write`][5], so you can create a new API key with the Remote Configuration capability, or add the capability to an existing API key. Contact your organization's Datadog administrator to update your permissions if you don't have it. A key with this capability allows you to authenticate and authorize your Agent to use Remote Configuration.

3. On the [Remote Configuration][8] page, enable Remote Configuration. This enables Datadog components across your organization to receive configurations from Datadog.
**Note:** Beginning April 8, 2024, Remote Configuration is on-by-default for:
* New child organizations that are created by existing Datadog customers who already have enabled Remote Configuration at the parent organization level **and** are in the same Datadog site as their parent organization.
* Organizations created by new Datadog customers.
  
To opt-out of Remote Configuration use, see the [opt-out section][23].

6. Select an existing API key or create a new API key, and enable the Remote Configuration capability on the key. If your new organization fulfills the conditions mentioned in step 3, Remote Configuration is enabled on your API keys be default.

   {{<img src="agent/remote_config/RC_Key_updated.png" alt="API Key properties with Remote Configuration capability Enable button." width="90%" style="center">}}

7. Update your Agent configuration file:
**Note:** This step is required only for Agent versions 7.46.0 or lower. Starting with Agent version 7.47.0, `remote_configuration.enabled` is set to `true` by default in the Agent. To opt-out of Remote Configuration use, see the [opt-out section][23].

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Configuration YAML file" %}}
Add the following to your configuration YAML file, specifying the API key that has Remote Configuration capability enabled:
```yaml
api_key: xxx
remote_configuration:
  enabled: true
``` 

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Environment variable" %}}
Add the following to your Datadog Agent manifest, specifying the API key that has Remote Configuration capability enabled:
```yaml
DD_API_KEY=xxx
DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED=true
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Helm" %}}
Add the following to your Helm chart, specifying the API key that has Remote Configuration capability enabled:
```yaml
datadog:
  apiKey: xxx
remoteConfiguration:
  enabled: true
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


6. Restart your Agent for the changes to take effect. 

After you perform these steps, your Agent requests its configuration from Datadog, and the features that use remote configuration are enabled:
- [CSM Threats default agent rules][9] update automatically as released.
- [APM Agent-level sampling rates][10] are applied.  
- [Dynamic Instrumentation][11] is enabled.
- [ASM 1-Click enablement, IP blocking, and attack pattern updates][12] are enabled.

## Best practices

### Datadog Audit Trail

Use [Datadog Audit Trail][13] to monitor organization access and Remote Configuration enabled events. Audit Trail allows your administrators and security teams to track the creation, deletion, and modification of Datadog API and application keys. After Audit Trail is configured, you can view events related to Remote Configuration enabled features and who has requested these changes. Audit Trail allows you to reconstruct sequences of events, and establish robust Datadog monitoring for Remote Configuration. 

### Monitors

Configure [monitors][14] to receive notifications when an event of interest is encountered.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues using Remote Configuration, use the following troubleshooting guidelines. If you need further assistance, contact [Datadog support][15].

### Restart the Agent

After the Agent configuration is updated in the [`datadog.yaml`][16] file, restart the Agent for this change to take effect. 

### Ensure Datadog Remote Configuration endpoints are reachable from your environment	

To use Remote Configuration, both the Agent and the Observability Pipelines Worker deployed in your environment communicate to Datadog Remote Configuration [endpoints][17]. For private network connection between your environment and Datadog, you can also connect to Remote Configuration Virtual Private Cloud [endpoints][25]. Ensure that outbound HTTPS has access to Remote Configuration endpoints from your environment. If you also have a proxy in between Datadog and your environment, update your [proxy settings][18] to incorporate Remote Configuration endpoints.

### Enable Remote Configuration at the organization level

To enable Remote Configuration at the [Organization][8] level in the Datadog UI, follow the **Organization Settings > Security > Remote Configuration** menu. This allows your authenticated and authorized Datadog components to remotely receive configurations and security detection rules of supported features from Datadog. Only users who have the [`org_management`][7] RBAC permission can enable Remote Configuration at the Organization level.

### Enable Remote Configuration on the API key

To authenticate and authorize the Agent to receive configurations and security detection rules, and to allow the Observability Pipelines Worker to receive configurations, enable Remote Configuration on the relevant API Key. Only users who have the [`api_keys_write`][5] RBAC permission can enable Remote Configuration on the API Key.

**Note:** If you have [`api_keys_write`][5] RBAC permission, but are missing Remote Configuration [Organization][8] level permissions, you cannot enable Remote Configuration on a new or an existing API Key. You only have permission to disable Remote Configuration on an existing API Key.

### Review Remote Configuration status of Agents and Tracing libraries

Gain visibility into the Remote Configuration status of your Agent and Tracing library through the [Remote Configuration UI][8]. 

The following table describes the meaning of each Agent status:

  | Agent Status     | Description                                      |
  |------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | CONNECTED      | The Agent deployed in your environment is able to reach, authenticate, and authorize successfully to Datadog. This is the optimal state you want your Agents to be in for Remote Configuration.                                               |    
  | UNAUTHORIZED          | The Agent deployed in your environment is able to reach Datadog but is not able to authenticate and authorize with Datadog for Remote Configuration operation. The most likely cause is the API Key used by the Agent is not Remote Configuration-enabled. To fix the issue, enable Remote Configuration capability on the API Key used by the Agent.                                                 | 
  | CONNECTION ERROR        |   The Agent deployed in your environment has `remote_config.enabled` set to true in its `datadog.yaml` configuration file, however, the Agent cannot be found in the Remote Configuration service. The most likely cause is that the Agent is unable to reach Remote Configuration [endpoints][17]. To fix the issue, allow outbound HTTPS access to Remote Configuration endpoints from your environment. This status displays when the Agent version is `7.45.0` or higher. 
  | DISABLED       |   The Agent deployed in your environment has `remote_config.enabled` set to false in its `datadog.yaml` configuration file. Set `remote_config.enabled` to true if you want to enable Remote Configuration on the Agent. This status displays when the Agent version is `7.45.0` or higher. | 
  | NOT CONNECTED       | The Agent cannot be found in the Remote Configuration service and could have `remote_config.enabled` set to true or false in its `datadog.yaml` configuration file. Check your local Agent configuration or your proxy settings. This status displays when the Agent version is higher than `7.41.1` but lower than `7.45.0`.            | 
  | UNSUPPORTED AGENT   | The Agent is on a version that is not Remote Configuration capable. To fix this issue, update the Agent to the latest available version. |

The following table describes the meaning of each Tracing library status:

  | Tracing library Status| Description                                      |
  |------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | CONNECTED      | The Tracing library is successfully connected to the Remote Configuration service through the associated Agent. This is the optimal state you want your Tracing library to be in for Remote Configuration.                                               |    
  | UNAUTHORIZED          | The Tracing library is associated with an Agent which doesn't have `Remote Config Read` permission on its API key. To fix the issue, you need to enable Remote Configuration capability on the API Key used by the Agent associated with the Tracing library.| 
  | CONNECTION ERROR        |   The Tracing library deployed in your environment is associated with an Agent that has remote_config.enabled set to true in its `datadog.yaml` configuration file, however, the agent cannot be found in the Remote Configuration service. The most likely cause of this is that the associated Agent is unable to reach Remote Configuration [endpoints][17]. To fix the issue, you need to allow outbound HTTPS access to Remote Configuration endpoints from your environment.  
  | DISABLED       |   The Tracing library deployed in your environment is associated with an Agent that has `remote_config.enabled` set to false in its `datadog.yaml` configuration file. This could be set deliberately or mistakenly. To enable Remote Configuration on the associated Agent, set `remote_config.enabled` to true.  | 
  | NOT CONNECTED       | The Tracing library cannot be found in the Remote Configuration service and is associated with an Agent that could have `remote_config.enabled` set to true or false in its `datadog.yaml` configuration file. Check your local Agent configuration or your proxy settings.| 
  | UNSUPPORTED AGENT   | The Tracing library is associated with an Agent which is not Remote Configuration capable. To fix this issue, update the associated Agent software to the latest available version. |
  | NOT DETECTED   | The Tracing library does not support Remote Configuration. To fix this issue, update the Tracing library software to the latest available version. |
  | UNKNOWN   | The Tracing library status is unknown, and it can't be determined if an Agent is associated with the Tracing library. For example, this could be because the Agent is deployed on a fully managed serverless container service like AWS Fargate. |

## Opting out of Remote Configuration 
To opt-out of Remote Configuration use, you can disable Remote Configuration at the organization level. Optionally, you can also disable Remote Configuration capability at the API key level and Agent level.

### At the Organization level
Disable Remote Configuration at the organization level on the [Remote Configuration][8] page. This disables Datadog components across your organization to receive configurations from Datadog. You need the [`org_management`][7] permission to disable Remote Configuration at the organization level.

### At the API key level
Disable the API key of your choice on the [API Keys][24] page. You need the [`api_keys_write`][5] permission to disable Remote Configuration on an API key.

### At the Agent level
Starting with Agent version 7.47.0, `remote_configuration.enabled` is set to `true` by default in the Agent. This setting causes the Agent to request configuration updates from the Datadog site.

To receive configurations from Datadog, you also need to take the following steps:
- Enable Remote Configuration at the organization level.
- Enable Remote Configuration capability on your API Key from the Datadog UI.
- Allow outbound HTTPS access to Remote Configuration [endpoints][17] from your environment.

If you don't want your Agent to send configuration requests to Datadog, you can set `remote_configuration.enabled` to `false` in the Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Configuration YAML file" %}}
Change `remote_configuration.enabled` from `true` to `false` in your [configuration YAML file][101]:
```yaml
remote_configuration:
  enabled: false
``` 

[101]: /agent/configuration/agent-configuration-files/?tab=agentv6v7#agent-main-configuration-file
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Environment variable" %}}
Add the following to your Datadog Agent manifest:
```yaml
DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED=false
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Helm" %}}
Add the following to your Helm chart:
```yaml
datadog:
  remoteConfiguration:
    enabled: false
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Supported environments

Remote Configuration works in environments where the Datadog Agent is deployed. For a Serverless Container service like AWS Fargate, the underlying hosts do not appear in the Remote Configuration onboarding workflow. Remote Configuration does not support Serverless Container Managed Apps (AWS App Runner, Azure Container Apps, Google Cloud Run) and Functions deployed with Container Packaging (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions)
.
