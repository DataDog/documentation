Installing the Agent directly on your host (rather than having the Agent run in a Pod) provides additional visibility into your ecosystem, independent of Kubernetes.

To gather your kube-state metrics:

1. Download the [Kube-State manifests folder][1].

2. Apply them to your Kubernetes cluster:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f <NAME_OF_THE_KUBE_STATE_MANIFESTS_FOLDER>
  ```

## Setup the kube-dns integration
### Configuration

Since [Agent v6][2], Kubernetes DNS integration works automatically with the [Autodiscovery][3].

Note: these metrics are unavailable for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 

## Collect container logs

**Available for Agent >6.0**

Two installations are possible:

- On the node where the Agent is external to the Docker environment
- Deployed with its containerized version in the Docker environment

Take advantage of DaemonSets to [automatically deploy the Datadog Agent on all your nodes][4]. Otherwise follow the [container log collection steps][5] to start collecting logs from all your containers.

To get a better idea of how (or why) to integrate your Kubernetes service, see the related series of [Datadog blog posts][6].
