The default configuration targets Kubernetes 1.7.6 and later, as the Agent relies on features and endpoints introduced in this version. More installation steps are required for older versions:

- [RBAC objects][1] (`ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings`) are available since Kubernetes 1.6 and OpenShift 3.3, but are available under different `apiVersion` prefixes:

  * `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` in Kubernetes 1.8+ (and OpenShift 3.9+), the default apiVersion we target
  * `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` in Kubernetes 1.5 to 1.7 (and OpenShift 3.7)
  * `v1` in Openshift 3.3 to 3.6

    Apply the Datadog Agent yaml manifests with the following `sed` invocations:

    ```
    sed "s%authorization.k8s.io/v1%authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1%" clusterrole.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    sed "s%authorization.k8s.io/v1%authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1%" clusterrolebinding.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    or for Openshift 3.3 to 3.6:

    ```
    sed "s%rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1%v1%" clusterrole.yaml | oc apply -f -
    sed "s%rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1%v1%" clusterrolebinding.yaml | oc apply -f -
    ```

- The `kubelet` check retrieves metrics from the Kubernetes 1.7.6+ (OpenShift 3.7.0+) prometheus endpoint. [Enable cAdvisor port mode][2] for older versions.

- The default DaemonSet makes use of the [downward API][3] to pass the kubelet's IP to the agent. This only works on versions 1.7 and up. For older versions, here are other ways to enable kubelet connectivity:

  * On version 1.6, use `fieldPath: spec.nodeName` and verify your node name is resolvable and reachable from the pod.
  * If `DD_KUBERNETES_KUBELET_HOST` is unset, the Agent retrieves the node hostname from docker and tries to connect there. See `docker info | grep "Name:"` and verify the name is resolvable and reachable.
  * If the IP of the docker default gateway is constant across your cluster, pass that IP in the `DD_KUBERNETES_KUBELET_HOST` envvar. You can retrieve the IP with the `ip addr show | grep docker0` command.

- The default configuration relies on [bearer token authentication][4] to the API server and kubelet. On 1.3, the kubelet does not support bearer token auth, setup client certificates for the `datadog-agent` serviceaccount and pass them to the agent.
