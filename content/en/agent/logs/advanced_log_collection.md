This document contains a set of advanced log collection configuration functions for your Datadog Agent, learn how to: 

* [Filter logs](#filter-logs)
* [Scrub sensitive data in your logs](#scrub-sensitive-data-in-your-logs)
* [Do multi-line aggregation](#multi-line-aggregation)
* [Tail multiple directories or whole directories by using wildcards](#tail-multiple-directories-or-whole-directories-by-using-wildcards)
* [Use a Proxy for log collection](#use-a-proxy-for-log-collection)


## Filter logs

To send only a specific subset of logs to Datadog use the `log_processing_rules` parameter in your configuration file with the **exclude_at_match** or **include_at_match** `type`.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "exclude_at_match" %}}

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `exclude_at_match` | If the specified pattern is contained in the message, the log is excluded and not sent to Datadog. |

For example, filtering out logs that contain a Datadog email address:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /my/test/file.log
    service: cardpayment
    source: java
    log_processing_rules:
    - type: exclude_at_match
      name: exclude_datadoghq_users
      ## Regexp can be anything
      pattern: \w+@datadoghq.com
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "include_at_match" %}}

| Parameter          | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `include_at_match` | Only logs with a message that includes the specified pattern are sent to Datadog. |

For example, sending only logs that contain a Datadog email address:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /my/test/file.log
    service: cardpayment
    source: java
    log_processing_rules:
    - type: include_at_match
      name: include_datadoghq_users
      ## Regexp can be anything
      pattern: \w+@datadoghq.com
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

**Note**: If you set up multiple processing rules, they are applied sequentially. Each rule is applied on the result of the previous one.

## Scrub sensitive data in your logs

If your logs contain sensitive information that you want to redact, configure the Datadog Agent to scrub sensitive sequences by using the `log_processing_rules` parameter in your configuration file with the **mask_sequences** `type`.

This replaces all matched groups with `replace_placeholder` parameter value.

For example, redact credit card numbers:

```yaml
logs:
 - type: file
   path: /my/test/file.log
   service: cardpayment
   source: java
   log_processing_rules:
      - type: mask_sequences
        name: mask_credit_cards
        replace_placeholder: "[masked_credit_card]"
        ##One pattern that contains capture groups
        pattern: (?:4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?|[25][1-7][0-9]{14}|6(?:011|5[0-9][0-9])[0-9]{12}|3[47][0-9]{13}|3(?:0[0-5]|[68][0-9])[0-9]{11}|(?:2131|1800|35\d{3})\d{11})
```

## Multi-line aggregation

If your logs are not sent in JSON and you want to aggregate several lines into one single entry, configure the Datadog Agent to detect a new log using a specific regex pattern instead of having one log per line. This is accomplished by using the `log_processing_rules` parameter in your configuration file with the **multi_line** `type` which aggregates all lines into one single entry until the given pattern is detected again.

For example, every Java log line starts with a timestamp in `yyyy-dd-mm` format. These lines include a stack trace that can be sent as two logs:

```
2018-01-03T09:24:24.983Z UTC Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16)
        at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25)
        at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14)
2018-01-03T09:26:24.365Z UTC starting upload of /my/file.gz
```

To achieve this, you need to use the following `log_processing_rules`:

```yaml
logs:
 - type: file
   path: /var/log/pg_log.log
   service: database
   source: postgresql
   log_processing_rules:
      - type: multi_line
        name: new_log_start_with_date
        pattern: \d{4}\-(0?[1-9]|1[012])\-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
```

More examples:

| **Raw string**           | **Pattern**                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 14:20:15                 | `\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}`                        |
| 11/10/2014               | `\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4}`                      |
| Thu Jun 16 08:29:03 2016 | `\w{3}\s+\w{3}\s+\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}` |
| 20180228                 | `\d{8}`                                    |

**Note**: Regex patterns for multi-line logs must start at the **beginning** of a log. Patterns cannot be matched mid-line.

## Tail multiple directories or whole directories by using wildcards

If your log files are labeled by date or all stored in the same directory, configure your Datadog Agent to monitor them all and automatically detect new ones by using wildcards in the `path` attribute.

* Using `path: /var/log/myapp/*.log`:
  * Matches all `.log` file contained in the `/var/log/myapp/` directory.
  * Doesn't match `/var/log/myapp/myapp.conf`.

* Using `path: /var/log/myapp/*/*.log`:
  * Matches `/var/log/myapp/log/myfile.log`.
  * Matches `/var/log/myapp/errorLog/myerrorfile.log`
  * Doesn't match `/var/log/myapp/mylogfile.log`.

Configuration example:

```yaml
logs:
 - type: file
   path: /var/log/myapp/*.log
   service: mywebapp
   source: go
```

**Note**: The Agent requires read and execute permissions on a directory to list all the available files in it.

## Use a Proxy for log collection

[Refer to the Agent proxy documentation][1] to learn how to forward your Logs with a proxy.
