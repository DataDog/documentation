Log collection requires the Datadog Agent v6.0+. Older versions of the Agent do not include the `log collection` interface. If you are not using the Agent already, follow the [Agent installation instructions][1].

## Activate log collection

Collecting logs is **disabled** by default in the Datadog Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "HTTP compressed" %}}

Datadog recommends that you send compressed logs over HTTPS with the Datadog Agent v6.14+, enable log collection in the Agent's [main configuration file][1] (`datadog.yaml`):

```yaml
logs_enabled: true
logs_config:
  use_http: true
  use_compression: true
```

To send logs with environment variables, configure the following:

* `DD_LOGS_ENABLED`
* `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_USE_HTTP`
* `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_USE_COMPRESSION`

For more details about the compression perfomances and batching size, refer to the [HTTPS section][2].

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "HTTP uncompressed" %}}

To send logs over HTTPS with the Datadog Agent v6.14+, enable log collection in the Agent's [main configuration file][1] (`datadog.yaml`):

```yaml
logs_enabled: true
logs_config:
  use_http: true
```

Use `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_USE_HTTP` to configure this through environment variable.

For more details about the compression perfomances and batching size, refer to the [HTTPS section][2].

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "TCP" %}}

TCP log forwarding is the default behaviour of the Datadog Agent. Enable log collection in the Agent's [main configuration file][1] (`datadog.yaml`):

```yaml
logs_enabled: true
```

By default, the Datadog Agent sends its logs to Datadog over TLS-encrypted TCP. This requires outbound communication over port `10516`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

After activating log collection, the Agent is ready to forward logs to Datadog. Next, configure the Agent on where to collect logs from.

## Enabling log collection from integrations

To collect logs for a given integration, uncomment the logs section in that integration's `conf.yaml` file and configure it for your environment.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Consult the <a href="/integrations/#cat-log-collection">list of supported integrations</a>  that include out of the box log configurations.
</div>

If you're using Kubernetes, make sure to [enable log collection in your DaemonSet setup][2]. If you're using Docker, [enable log collection for the containerized Agent][3]. For more information about log collection from containerized environments, refer to the [Container Log Collection][4] documentation. If an integration does not support logs by default, use the custom log collection.

## Custom log collection

Datadog Agent v6 can collect logs and forward them to Datadog from files, the network (TCP or UDP), journald, and Windows channels:

1. Create a new `<CUSTOM_LOG_SOURCE>.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` directory at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][5].
2. Create a new `conf.yaml` file in this new folder.
3. Add a custom log collection configuration group with the parameters below.
4. [Restart your Agent][6] to take into account this new configuration.
5. Run the [Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `<CUSTOM_LOG_SOURCE>` under the Checks section.

Below are examples of custom log collection setup:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Tail files" %}}

To gather logs from your `<APP_NAME>` application stored in `<PATH_LOG_FILE>/<LOG_FILE_NAME>.log` create a `<APP_NAME>.d/conf.yaml` file at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][1] with the following content:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: "<PATH_LOG_FILE>/<LOG_FILE_NAME>.log"
    service: "<APP_NAME>"
    source: "<SOURCE>"
```

**Note**: When tailing files for logs, the Datadog Agent v6 for **Windows** requires the log files have UTF8 encoding.

[1]: /agent/guide/agent-configuration-files
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "TCP/UDP" %}}

To gather logs from your `<APP_NAME>` application that forwards its logs with TCP over port **10518**, create a `<APP_NAME>.d/conf.yaml` file at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][1] with the following content:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: tcp
    port: 10518
    service: "<APP_NAME>"
    source: "<CUSTOM_SOURCE>"
```

If you are using Serilog, `Serilog.Sinks.Network` is an option for connecting with UDP.

**Note**: The Agent supports raw string, JSON, and Syslog formatted logs. If you are sending logs in batch, use line break characters to separate your logs.

[1]: /agent/guide/agent-configuration-files
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "journald" %}}

To gather logs from journald, create a `journald.d/conf.yaml` file at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][1] with the following content:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: journald
    path: /var/log/journal/
```

Refer to the [journald integration][2] documentation for more details regarding the setup for containerized environments and units filtering.

[1]: /agent/guide/agent-configuration-files
[2]: /integrations/journald
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Windows Events" %}}

To send Windows events as logs to Datadog, add the channels to `conf.d/win32_event_log.d/conf.yaml` manually or use the Datadog Agent Manager.

To see your channel list, run the following command in a PowerShell:

```text
Get-WinEvent -ListLog *
```

To see the most active channels, run the following command in a PowerShell:

```text
Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | sort RecordCount -Descending
```

Then add the channels to your `win32_event_log.d/conf.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: windows_event
    channel_path: "<CHANNEL_1>"
    source: "<CHANNEL_1>"
    service: "<SERVICE>"
    sourcecategory: windowsevent

  - type: windows_event
    channel_path: "<CHANNEL_2>"
    source: "<CHANNEL_2>"
    service: "<SERVICE>"
    sourcecategory: windowsevent
```

Edit the `<CHANNEL_X>` parameters with the Windows channel name you want to collect events from.
Set the corresponding `source` parameter to the same channel name to benefit from the [integration automatic processing pipeline setup][1].

Finally, [restart the Agent][2].

## Send logs over HTTPS

**Compressed HTTPS log forwarding is the recommended configuration** because a 200 response is returned only if the logs have been written in the Datadog storage:

{{< img src="agent/HTTPS_intake_reliability_schema.png" alt="HTTPS Intake Schema"  style="width:80%;">}}


```yaml
logs_enabled: true
logs_config:
  use_http: true
  use_compression: true
  compression_level: 6
```

The Agent sends HTTPS batches with the following limits:

* Maximum content size per payload: 1MB
* Maximum size for a single log: 256kB
* Maximum array size if sending multiple logs in an array: 200 entries logs.

### Log compression

The `compression_level` parameter (or `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`) accepts values from `0` (no compression) to `9` (maximum compression but higher resource usage). The default value is `6`.

See the [Datadog Agent overhead section][10] for more information about Agent resource usage when compression is enabled.

### Configure the batch wait time

The Agent waits up to 5 seconds to fill each batch (either in content size or number of logs). Therefore, in the worst case scenario (when very few logs are generated) switching to HTTPS might add a 5-second latency compared to TCP, which sends all logs in real time.

To change the maximum time the Datadog Agent waits to fill each batch, add the following in the Agent's [main configuration file][3] (`datadog.yaml`):

```yaml
logs_config:
  batch_wait: 2
```

Or use the `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_BATCH_WAIT` environment variable.
The unit is seconds and must be an integer between `1` and `10`.

### HTTPS Proxy configuration

When logs are sent through HTTPS, use the same [set of proxy settings][11] as the other data types to send logs through a web proxy.
