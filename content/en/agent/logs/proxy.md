Log collection requires the Datadog Agent v6.0+. Older versions of the Agent do not include the `log collection` interface.

By default, Datadog transports logs over TCP/SSL. Hence, there is a different [set of proxy settings][1] than other data types that the Datadog Agent forwards in HTTPS.
Configure the Agent to send logs in HTTPS using the same set of proxy settings as other data types.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "TCP" %}}

If you use a proxy for TCP transmission, configure the Datadog Agent to send logs to your proxy through TCP using the following parameters in the `datadog.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
logs_config:
  logs_dd_url: "<PROXY_ENDPOINT>:<PROXY_PORT>"
  logs_no_ssl: true
```

The parameters above can also be set with the following environment variables:

* `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_LOGS_DD_URL`
* `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_LOGS_NO_SSL`

**Note**: The parameter `logs_no_ssl` is required to make the Agent ignore the discrepancy between the hostname on the SSL certificate (`agent-intake.logs.datadoghq.com` or `agent-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu`) and your proxy hostname. It is recommended to use a SSL encrypted connection between your proxy and Datadog intake endpoint.

* Then configure your proxy to listen on `<PROXY_PORT>` and forward the received logs to:
    * For `app.datadoghq.com`: `agent-intake.logs.datadoghq.com` on port `10516` and activate SSL encryption.
    * For `app.datadoghq.eu`: `agent-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu` on port `443` and activate SSL encryption.

* Download the `CA certificates` for TLS encryption for the SSL encryption with the following command:
    * `sudo apt-get install ca-certificates` (Debian, Ubuntu)
    * `yum install ca-certificates` (CentOS, Redhat)
  And use the certificate file located in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`(Debian, Ubuntu) or `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` (CentOS, Redhat)

{{% tab "SOCKS5" %}}

To send your logs to your Datadog account with a SOCKS5 proxy server use the following settings in your `datadog.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
logs_config:
  socks5_proxy_address: "<MY_SOCKS5_PROXY_URL>:<MY_SOCKS5_PROXY_PORT>"
```

The parameter above can also be set with the following environment variable:

* `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_SOCKS5_PROXY_ADDRESS`

When the Agent is [configured to send logs through HTTPS][1], use the same [set of proxy settings][2] as the other data types in order to send logs through a web proxy.
