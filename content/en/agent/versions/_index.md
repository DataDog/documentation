## Changes between major Agent versions

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Agent v7 vs v6" %}}

Agent v7 is the latest major version of the Datadog Agent. The only change from Agent v6 is that **this version only includes support for Python 3 for integrations and custom checks**.

See the [Upgrade to Agent v7 documentation][1] to learn how to upgrade your Agent to version 7. All official integrations support Python 3 out-of-the-box. Follow the [Python 3 Custom Check Migration guide][2] to migrate your custom checks to Python 3.

**Note**: You can test this migration with Agent v6, by [Using Python 3 with Datadog Agent v6][3].

**Agent version 6 main changes**:

The big difference between Agent 5 and Agent 6 is that Agent 6 is a complete rewrite of the core Agent in Golang. Golang has allowed the Agent to take advantage of concurrency. In place of the three processes the Agent v5 used to run—_the Forwarder_, _the Collector_, and _DogStatsD_—there is now only one process: _the Agent_. It also comes with a number of other core improvements:

- Agent v6 has significantly improved resource usage over Agent v5:

  - Decreased CPU usage
  - Decreased memory usage
  - Fewer file descriptors
  - All around decreased footprint

- Agent 6 uses [two additional ports][1]:

  - `5000` to expose its runtime metrics.
  - `5001` for the [Agent CLI/GUI commands][2].

    **Note**: You can specify different ports for `expvar_port` and `cmd_port` in the `datadog.yaml` file.

- Custom build your Agent v6 and [DogStatsD][3] much easier and with many more configuration options, to include or exclude almost anything.

**Agent v6 new functionalities**:

To see all changes between Agent v5 and v6, consult the [Datadog Agent dedicated changes][4] documentation. The following are key differentiators:

- [Distributions metrics][5] can be performed on the server directly to calculate real, effective global percentiles. (NOTE: this feature is in BETA. Contact support for details on how to have it enabled for your account.)
- [DogStatsD][3] can be used over a Unix socket instead of over UDP.
- [Live Process monitoring is available for Windows][6].
- [Prometheus OpenMetrics is supported natively][7].
- [All your logs can be sent to Datadog for alerting, analysis, and correlation with metrics][8].
