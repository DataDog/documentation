## Overview

The FIPS Agent is a flavor of the Datadog Agent that natively supports Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliance. The FIPS Agent's compliance is based on its use of the FIPS 140-2 validated [Cryptographic Module - Certificate #4282][1]. See the related [security policy][2] for information about validated operating environments and restrictions. 

The FIPS Agent also includes [limited support for integrations][3] that need to collect observability data that is external to the host.

**It is your responsibility to ensure operating environment compliance with the security policy and wider FIPS guidance.**

## Supported platforms and limitations


Supported platforms:

|||
| ---  | ----------- |

| Cloud and container| Amazon ECS<br>AWS EKS (Helm)<br>Docker|

Supported products (Agent 7.65.0 and above):
- Metrics
- Logs
- APM traces
- APM profiles
- Processes
- Orchestrator Explorer
- Runtime Security
- Serverless Monitoring

The Datadog FIPS Agent does **not** support the following:

## Prerequisites
<div class="alert alert-warning">
The following prerequisites are a rough guideline of the additional controls required for the compliance of the deployed system. The compliance needs are likely to be unique in most circumstances. It is therefore the customer's responsibility to evaluate their needs and ensure overall system compliance.
</div>
The following are generally requirement for each platform, your system may require additional controls:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Linux" %}}
- A non-containerized Linux host.
- Your Linux OS must be in FIPS-compliant mode. See your OS vendor's documentation on what steps are required to meet this requirement.
- FIPS-compliant storage backing the host file system.
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Windows" %}}
- A non-containerized Windows host.
- Windows must be in [FIPS-compliant mode][1].
- FIPS-compliant storage backing the host file system.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "AWS Lambda" %}}
- Use a FIPS-compliant region (for example, AWS GovCloud)
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "AWS ECS" %}}
- Use a FIPS-compliant region (for example, AWS GovCloud)
- Configure AWS compute services (EC2 or Fargate) in FIPS mode
- Use FIPS-compliant storage for your ECS tasks
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
- Use a FIPS-compliant region (for example, AWS GovCloud)
- Configure EKS worker nodes in FIPS mode
- Use FIPS-compliant storage for your EKS worker nodes
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

In addition to the Operating System (OS) requirements above:
- You must have access to a FIPS-compliant Datadog environment (US1-FED).
- The Agent version must be 7.65.0 and above to access the FIPS Agent

## Installation

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Linux" %}}

1. Install the Agent with FIPS support.

   **Note:** FIPS support is only available on Agent versions 7.65.0 and above:
   1. If you're using the Agent install script, specify the `DD_AGENT_FLAVOR="datadog-fips-agent"` environment variable in your installation command. For example:

      ```sh
      DD_SITE="ddog-gov.com" DD_API_KEY="MY_API_KEY" DD_AGENT_FLAVOR="datadog-fips-agent" â€¦ bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh)"
      ```
   1. If you're installing with a package, [follow the instructions][1] to install the latest `datadog-fips-agent` package available for your platform.
   1. Add `GOFIPS=1` to your Datadog environment variables, reload all service units, and restart the Datadog Agent service (`datadog-agent.service`). For example, if your host is using systemd:

      ```sh
      echo "GOFIPS=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/datadog-agent/environment
      systemctl daemon-reload
      systemctl restart 'datadog-agent*'
      ```
1. Run the `datadog-agent status` command and make sure you see `FIPS Mode: enabled` in the status output.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Windows" %}}

1. Follow the [Windows instructions][1] to uninstall any existing Datadog Agent on the machine.
1. Run the command below to install the FIPS Agent, replacing `DATADOG_API_KEY` with your API key:

   **Note:** FIPS support is only available on Agent versions 7.65.0 and above:

   {{< code-block lang="powershell" >}}
$p = Start-Process -Wait -PassThru msiexec -ArgumentList '/qn /i https://windows-agent.datadoghq.com/datadog-fips-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi /log C:\Windows\SystemTemp\install-datadog.log APIKEY="<DATADOG_API_KEY>" SITE="ddog-gov.com"'
if ($p.ExitCode -ne 0) {
   Write-Host "msiexec failed with exit code $($p.ExitCode) please check the logs at C:\Windows\SystemTemp\install-datadog.log" -ForegroundColor Red
}
{{< /code-block >}}

1. Run the Agent `status` command and make sure you see `FIPS Mode: enabled` in the status output.

   ```powershell
   & "$env:ProgramFiles\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\agent.exe" status
   ```

   {{< img src="/agent/fips-powershell.png" alt="Agent status command output with FIPS Mode enabled - Windows" style="width:100%;" >}}


**Note**: The program name for the FIPS Agent in **Add or Remove Programs** is "Datadog FIPS Agent."

{{% tab "AWS Lambda" %}}

For AWS Lambda FIPS compliance, follow the instructions in the [AWS Lambda FIPS Compliance](/serverless/aws_lambda/fips-compliance/) documentation.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "AWS ECS" %}}

When following the [ECS installation instructions](/containers/amazon_ecs/), make sure to use these FIPS-specific configuration values for your Task Definition:
- Set `image` in the `containerDefinitions` object to `public.ecr.aws/datadog/agent:7-fips`  
- Set `DD_SITE` environment variable to `ddog-gov.com`

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}

When following the [Datadog Agent installation on Kubernetes](/containers/kubernetes/installation/) instructions, make sure to include these FIPS-specific configuration values in the `datadog-agent.yaml` file depending on your chosen installation method:

For the Datadog Operator:
```yaml
datadog:
   site: "ddog-gov.com"
useFIPSAgent: true
```

For the Datadog Helm Chart:
```yaml
spec:
   global:
      site: "ddog-gov.com"
      useFIPSAgent: true
```

## Security and hardening

You, the Datadog customer, are responsible for **host** security and hardening.

**Security considerations:**
- While the Datadog images provided are constructed with security in mind, they have not been evaluated against CIS benchmark recommendations or DISA STIG standards.
- If you rebuild, reconfigure, or modify the Datadog FIPS Agent to fit your deployment or testing needs, you might end up with a technically working setup, but Datadog cannot guarantee FIPS compliance if the Datadog FIPS Agent is not used exactly as explained in the documentation.
- If you did not follow the installation steps listed above exactly as documented, Datadog cannot guarantee FIPS compliance.
