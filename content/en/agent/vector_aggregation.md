## Overview 

The Datadog Agent can be used along with [Vector][1]. In this scenario Agents send data
to Vector, which aggregates data from multiple upstream Agents:

`Agents -> Vector -> Datadog`

This scenario differs from using a [proxy][2] since Vector is able to process data before sending
it to Datadog and other destinations. Vector capabilities include:

* [Log parsing, structuring, and enrichment][3]
* Cost reduction through [sampling][4]
* [Redaction of PII][5] and sensitive data before it leaves your network
* [Deriving metrics from logs][6] for cost effective analysis
* [Routing to multiple destinations][7]

**Notes**:

- Only logs aggregation is supported.
- Vector can directly collect logs from alternative sources. When doing so, third party logs may not include proper tagging. A convenient way to [add tags][8], source or service values is to use the [Vector Remap Language][9].

## Configuration

### Agent configuration
To send logs to Vector, update the Agent configuration file, `datadog.yaml`.
Only the logs data type is supported. Update the following values in the `datadog.yaml` file:

```yaml
logs_config:
  logs_dd_url: "<VECTOR_HOST>:<VECTOR_PORT>"
  logs_no_ssl: true # If TLS/SSL is not enabled on the Vector side
  use_http: true # Vector `datadog_logs` source only supports HTTP
```

Where `VECTOR_HOST` is the hostname of the system running Vector and `VECTOR_PORT` is the TCP port on which
the Vector `datadog_logs` source is listening.

### Vector configuration
To receive logs from Datadog Agent, configure Vector with a [datadog_logs source][10].
To send logs to Datadog, Vector must be configured with at least one [datadog_logs sink][11].

See the official [Vector documentation][12] for all available configuration parameters and
transforms that can be applied to logs while they are processed by Vector.

Here is a configuration example that adds a tag to every log using the Vector Remap Language:

```yaml
sources:
  datadog_agents:
    type: datadog_logs
    address: "[::]:8080" # The <VECTOR_PORT> mentioned above should be set to the port value used here

transforms:
  add_tags:
    type: remap
    inputs:
      - datadog_agents
    source: |
      .ddtags = .ddtags + ",sender:vector"

sinks:
  to_datadog:
    type: datadog_logs
    inputs:
       - add_tags
    default_api_key: "${DATADOG_API_KEY_ENV_VAR}"
    encoding:
      codec: json
```

### Using Kubernetes

Using the official Datadog chart the [Agent configuration settings](#agent-configuration) described above can be added 
to the `agents.customAgentConfig` value. **Note**: `agent.useConfigMap` must be set to `true`
for `agents.customAgentConfig` to be taken into account.

For additional details about the Datadog Helm chart, see [the Kubernetes documentation][13].

Vector provides an [official chart for aggregating data][14] that comes with a Datadog
logs source preconfigured. For more information about installing Vector using Helm,
see to the [official Vector documentation][15].

To send logs to Datadog, a `datadog_logs` sink need to be added to the Vector
configuration. Vector's chart can hold any valid Vector configuration in the `values.yaml` file using the
`customConfig` field. To enable `datadog_logs` the same kind of configuration as 
described under [Vector configuration](#vector-configuration) can be directly included as-is in the Vector chart configuration.

## Manipulating Datadog logs with Vector

Logs sent to Vector can benefit from the full capabilities of Vector, including [Vector Remap Language][3] for log transformations.
When received by Vector, logs sent by the Datadog Agent are structured using the expected schema. When
submitting logs directly to the Datadog API, see the [API documentation][16]
for a complete schema description.

Logs collected by Vector from other sources can be [fully enriched][8]. VRL can be used to adjust those logs
to fill relevant fields according to the expected schema.
