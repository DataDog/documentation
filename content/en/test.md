**Custom tooltip shortcode**

Here's an example of a {{< tooltip text="tooltip" tooltip="This is additional information that appears in the tooltip" >}} in action. This is a real glossary tooltip {{< tooltip glossary="alert value" tooltip="This is additional information that appears in the tooltip" >}}.

**Glossary shortcode (default)**

By default, the {{< tooltip glossary="Agent" >}} is installed in a sandbox located at `/opt/datadog-agent`.
