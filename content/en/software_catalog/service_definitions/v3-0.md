## Overview

Schema v3.0 introduces several new features and enhancements to provide more flexibility and detailed definitions.

## Key features

- **Expanded data model**: v3.0 supports multiple kinds of entities. You can organize your systems using various components such as systems, services, queues, and datastores.

- **Multi-ownership**: You can assign multiple owners to any objects defined through the v3.0 schema to specify multiple points of contact.

- **Enhanced relationship mapping**: With APM and USM data, you can automatically detect dependencies among components. v3.0 supports manual declaration to augment auto-detected system topology to ensure a complete overview of how components interact within your systems.

- **Inheritance of system metadata**: Components within a system automatically inherit the system's metadata. It's no longer necessary to declare metadata for all related components one-by-one as in v2.1 and v2.2. 

- **Precise code location**: You can add the mapping of your code location for your service. The `codeLocations` section in v3.0 specifies the locations of the code with the repository that contains the code and its associated `paths`. The `paths` attribute is a list of [globs][4] that should match paths in the repository.  

## Metadata Schema v3.0

The Entity Definition Schema is a structure that contains basic information about an entity. See the [full schema on GitHub][1].

<div class="alert alert-info">In v3.0, the <code>application</code> field has been replaced with <code>system</code> in the documentation to match the updated public schema terminology. </div>

### Example YAML for `kind:system`
{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}
apiVersion: v3
kind: system
metadata:
  name: myapp
  displayName: My App
  tags:
    - tag:value
  links:
    - name: shopping-cart runbook
      type: runbook
      url: https://runbook/shopping-cart
    - name: shopping-cart architecture
      provider: gdoc
      url: https://google.drive/shopping-cart-architecture

### Specify common components that are part of multiple systems
If a single component is part of multiple systems, you must specify that component in the YAML for each system. For example, if the datastore `orders-postgres` is a component of both a postgres fleet and a web application, specify two YAMLs:

For the postgres fleet (`managed-postgres`), specify a definition for `kind:system`:
{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}
apiVersion: v3
kind: system
spec:
  components:
    - datastore:orders-postgres
    - datastore:foo-postgres
    - datastore:bar-postgres
metadata:
  name: managed-postgres
  owner: db-team
{{< /code-block >}}

For the web application (`shopping-cart`), declare a separate definition for `kind:system`:
{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}

apiVersion: v3
kind: system
spec:
  lifecycle: production
  tier: critical
  components:
    - service:shopping-cart-api
    - service:shopping-cart-processor
    - queue:orders-queue
    - datastore:orders-postgres
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart
  owner: shopping-team
  additionalOwners:
    - name: sre-team
      type: operator
---
apiVersion: v3
kind: datastore
metadata:
  name: orders-postgres
  additionalOwners:
    - name: db-team
      type: operator
---
apiVersion: v3
kind: service
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-api
---
apiVersion: v3
kind: service
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-processor
---
{{< /code-block >}}

### Explicit and implicit metadata inheritance 

#### Explicit Inheritance 
{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}
inheritFrom:<entity_kind>:<name>
{{< /code-block >}}

The `inheritFrom` field instructs the ingestion pipeline to inherit metadata from the entity's metadata referenced by `<entity_kind>:<name>`.

**Note**: The entity reference only applies to an entity from the same YAML file. 

#### Implicit Inheritance 
Components (`kind:service`, `kind:datastore`, `kind:queue`, `kind:ui`) inherit all metadata from the system that they belong to under the following conditions:
- There is only one system defined in the YAML file.
- The clause `inheritFrom:<entity_kind>:<name>` is absent in the YAML file.

### v3.0 API endpoints
To view v3.0 API endpoints, see the latest [API documentation][5].

## Schema Overview
You can see the [full schema definitions on Github][1]. Here is an overview of the schema structure:
- `api_version` is the schema version: 2.0, 2.1, 3.0
- `kind` field is new and defines the type of component: service, queue, datastore, system, or API
- `metadata` includes naming, description, ownership, links (documentation, runbooks, repositories, contacts, dashboards), and tags
- `spec` includes tier, lifecycle, language, type, and relationships to other components
- `integrations` includes connections to PagerDuty & OpsGenie
- `datadog` includes ways to filter and link to other Datadog data, such as code locations, pipelines, logs, and events

### Migrating to v3.0
v3.0 supports the same methods of creating metadata as previous versions, including Github, API, Terraform, Backstage, ServiceNow, and the UI. However, there are new [API endpoints][5] and a new [Terraform module][6] for v3.0.

You can see the [full schema definitions on Github][1]. V3.0 contains the following changes from v2.2:
- `schema_version` is now `api_version`
- `kind` field is new and defines the type of component: service, queue, datastore, system, or API
- `dd-service` is now `metadata.name`
- `team` is now `owner` and `additionalOwners` if there are multiple teams
- `lifecycle`, `tier`, `languages`, and `type` are now under `spec`
- `links`, `contacts`, and `description`, and `tags` are now under metadata
- `application` has been enhanced to become its own kind: `system`. It no longer exists as a discrete field on a service
