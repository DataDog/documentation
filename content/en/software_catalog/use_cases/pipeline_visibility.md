The Delivery tab in Software Catalog helps you assess and optimize your service's pre-production status by providing insights into CI pipelines and static analysis violations. 

{{< img src="tracing/software_catalog/pipeline-visibility-software-delivery.png" alt="The Delivery tab for monitoring pre-production status in Software Catalog" style="width:100%;" >}}

With Delivery, you can:

- Monitor the performance of CI pipelines related to your services.
- Identify security and code quality issues from [Static Analysis][1].
- Troubleshoot pre-production slowdowns and failures.
- Track Change Lead Time by integrating with [DORA Metrics][2].

By default, your service is linked to CI pipelines through its repository URL. To add or remove a pipeline associated with your service:

1. Click on your service in [Software Catalog][4] to open the service side panel, click on the Ownership tab, and find the edit options for Entity Metadata.

   **Note**: This is only available for [Software Catalog schema v2.2][3].

2. Edit the service metadata to add or remove a pipeline:

   - **Edit in UI**: Find the Software Delivery section, then search for and select the pipelines you want to associate with the service.

   - **Edit in GitHub**: Manually add a pipeline fingerprint under `ci-pipeline-fingerprints` in the service metadata YAML file (see [this example][6]). To find a pipeline's fingerprint, go to the [Pipelines][5] page, click on the pipeline, and select the gear icon. 

      {{< img src="tracing/software_catalog/pipeline-visibility-pipeline-fingerprint.png" alt="An example of a pipeline fingerprint" style="width:100%;" >}}

For more details on CI status and static analysis violations for the pipelines associated with a particular service, click on the service and navigate to the **Delivery** tab.
