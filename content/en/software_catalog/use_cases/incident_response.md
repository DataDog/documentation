Software Catalog enhances incident response by:

- Improving the on-call experience by verifying and consolidating ownership details, communication channels, and monitoring and troubleshooting resources.
- Embedding solutions and tools--like runbooks and documentation--directly into existing observability workflows.
- Accelerating incident recovery by simplifying the process of identifying owners of upstream and downstream dependencies.

Software Catalog also integrates with [Datadog Incident Management][1] and [PagerDuty][2], allowing you to view related incidents in the Reliability tab on the Service Details page.

**Note**: Datadog Incidents automatically link to Software Catalog, but you should apply `SERVICE` tags to incidents to ensure each service's incident data are accurate. The PagerDuty integration must be manually set up to integrate with incident information in Software Catalog.

To view incident statuses for upstream and downstream dependencies, click a service in Software Catalog to open the Service Details page, and then click on the Dependencies tab.
