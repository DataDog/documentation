Datadog's Software Catalog automates key tasks and centralizes essential resources (such as docs, runbooks, [scorecards][1], and [templates][2]) to reduce time-to-first-commit and optimize the overall developer experience.

## Quick access to documentation and standards

Software Catalog acts as a single source of truth for your engineering environment. Newly onboarded developers can:

- Quickly locate relevant [APIs][3], services, repositories, and dependencies.
- Access up-to-date documentation, code snippets, and runbooks, enabling them to start making meaningful contributions.
- Navigate [organized metadata and organizational inventory][4] to understand the team's structure, communication channels, and best practices.

## Automate onboarding workflows

[Software Templates][2] reduces the manual toil of onboarding by standardizing and streamlining common tasks. With Software Templates, you can:

- Kick off onboarding workflows that automatically provision Git repos, assign PagerDuty schedules, or notify relevant Slack channels.
- Integrate with third-party tools and systems to ensure every new developer starts with the correct permissions, environments, and resources.
- Scale onboarding processes as your team grows while maintaining consistency and quality across new hires.

[Explore App Builder blueprints][5] to automate developer onboarding tasks.
