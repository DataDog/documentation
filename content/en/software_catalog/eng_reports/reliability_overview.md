## Overview

The Reliability Overview Dashboard supports aggregated views of SLOs and Incidents to help executive leadership understand your organization's reliability at a glance. With this dashboard, you can:
- Customize your SLO or Incident groupings to be based on service, team, or other tags/properties that have been added to your SLOs/Incidents.
- Use a summary Score, based on the remaining error budget of the underlying SLOs, to understand SLO performance across different groups and identify areas of improvement.
- Explore daily, weekly, and monthly historical reliability trends (for the last 12 months) to understand performance over time.

Access the Reliability Overview Dashboard by clicking on the "Overview" tab in IDP and selecting "Reliability Overview" in the lefthand menu. 

**Note:** If you have not opted into our Datadog IDP Preview, you can access the Reliability Overview Dashboard by clicking on the "Reports" tab at the top of the Software Catalog page.


## Interact with your Reliability Overview Dashboard

By default, the Reliability Overview Dashboard offers a view aggregated by service or team (based on the service or team tag added to your SLOs, and the services or teams properties added to your Incidents). This allows you to view your organization's SLO performance by service/team groupings to understand which services/teams are performing best and worst.
