## Overview

The Scorecards Performance report includes an organization-wide view of Scorecard performance by teams and rules as well as historical trends. With this report, you can:
- Quickly identify highest and lowest performing teams by Scorecards and rules. 
- Filter information down based on team, scorecard, rule, application, tier, and lifecycle.
- Explore historical info for the last 12 months to identify key trends over time.

Access the Scorecards Performance report by clicking on the "Overview" tab in IDP and selecting "Scorecards Performance" in the lefthand menu. 

**Note:** If you have not opted into our Datadog IDP Preview, you can access the Scorecards Performance report by clicking on the "Reports" tab at the top of the Software Catalog page.


## Interact with your Scorecard Performance report

By default, the Scorecards Performance report includes data that is broken down by team. This allows you to easily identify highest and lower performing teams across all Scorecards, for specific Scorecards, or for specific rules.
