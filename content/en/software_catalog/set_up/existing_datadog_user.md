Learn how Software Catalog discovers services from Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Universal Service Monitoring (USM), Real User Monitoring (RUM), infrastructure metrics, and logs.

## Automatic discovery with APM, USM, and RUM

Datadog Software Catalog is pre-populated with entries detected through [APM][5], eBPF-based autodiscovery with [Universal Service Monitoring][6], and RUM applications.

All automatically detected components appear in the Component Selector within Software Catalog.

APM and USM automatically detect the following component types: `service`,`datastore`, `queue`, `external providers`, `inferred services`, and `endpoints`. APM SDKs identify dependencies of instrumented services and classify them as databases, queues, or third-party APIsâ€”even if those dependencies are not directly instrumented. Custom instrumentation may affect how components are auto-discovered and how the `service tag` is assigned. To learn more, see [APM Inferred Services][12].

RUM is responsible for discovering `frontend apps` components.

**Managing automatically-named services:**
- You can opt-in to [inferred entities][7] to filter out entities by type (database, queue, third-party).
- You can optionally [remove service overrides][8] such as `service:my-service-http-client` from your catalog or map.

For information about discovering endpoints, see [Discovering Endpoints from APM][10].

## Import components from Infrastructure and Logs 

You can import services from other Datadog telemetry containing the `DD_SERVICE` [tag][2] to populate your Software Catalog. To discover `kind:service` components through Datadog infrastructure metrics or logs, navigate to the Software Catalog [**Import Entries** tab][11].

After importing, entries appear in the **Explore** tab. Entries may expire unless you add metadata, such as the owner or contacts, by [using the API][3] or the [GitHub integration][4].

To remove imported services from the default **Explore** view, click **Clear Previously Imported Services** on the [**Import Entries** tab][11]. This removes all services that do not have metadata or do not have APM, Universal Service Monitoring (USM), or Real User Monitoring (RUM) telemetry.
