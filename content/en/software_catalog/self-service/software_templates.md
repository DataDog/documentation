Use Software Templates within Self-Service to help developers quickly provision infrastructure and create microservices that align with your best practices.

## Create a Software Template

A Software Template is stored in a Git repository and serves as a reusable framework. [Build apps][2] to collect inputs and pass them into the template repository to generate customized configurations.

To create a Software Template, you can:
- Start from an example using pre-built blueprints.
- Start from scratch by defining your own template and workflows.

### Start from an example

Use [App Builder Blueprints][9] to quickly configure an app or workflow. These blueprints provide working examples that you can customize by modifying inputs, integrating with source control or cloud providers, and adjusting permissions.

Example blueprints:

- **[Scaffold New Service blueprint][11]**: Create a form that collects developer inputs, integrates with GitHub, and generates a new repository or pull request.
- **[Create S3 Bucket blueprint][10]**: Generate Terraform code for an S3 bucket using a form in GitHub.
- **[Provision EKS Cluster blueprint][13]**: Generate Terraform code for a Kubernetes cluster in GitHub.
- **[Provision RDS Instance blueprint][14]**: Provision an RDS instance in AWS through an API call.

To use a blueprint:

1. Select a blueprint in [**App Builder Blueprints**][9].
1. Customize the form fields to capture required inputs.
1. Click **Save as New App** to create an app linked to a templating workflow.

### Start from scratch

To build a Software Template from scratch:

1. Create a form using App Builder:

    1. Navigate to **Actions** > **App Builder** from the left-hand menu, and select **New App**.
    1. Enter a name and description, and use the drag-and-drop editor to create a form that collects the required parameters.
       - You can use the `Form` component or build a custom UI.
    1. Select **New Query**, and use the **Trigger workflow** action to call your workflow and pass in parameters. 
       - Explore [Actions Catalog][7] for built-in integrations, or use the `HTTP` action to interact with any integrations not available.
    1. Create a **Button** that submits the form and triggers your workflow.
    1. Save and publish the app.

2. [Create a workflow][6] for your template:
   
   1. Navigate to [Workflow Automation][3] and click **New Workflow**. 
   1. Enter a name, add relevant tags, and define the input parameters you want to collect from users.
  
3. Configure the templating workflow:

   1. Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [actions][7] to retrieve your template files.
   1. Use the Apply Template [action][7] to manipulate your template repository and pass in your input parameters.
   1. Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [actions][7] to upload the project files to the repository.
   1. Save the workflow.

4. Test your app and workflow:

   1. Click **View App** to preview the app as a standalone page.
   1. Monitor the templating process in [Workflow Automation][3].

## Publish your app 

Once your Software Template is configured and tested, publish it so your team can use it. The publishing flow lets you:

- Define permissions to control access.
- Add the app to a Dashboard or the Self-Service portal for easy discovery.
