## Overview

Datadog Incident Management enables collaboration and response by integrating with a variety of third-party tools and platforms. Integrations allow you to connect your incident workflows with popular ticketing systems, communication channels, or status pages to ensure that your teams can coordinate, escalate, and resolve incidents, all within the context of your existing tools.

**How integrations work in Incident Management**

- **Automated Workflows:** Trigger actions in external systems (such as creating Jira tickets or updating Statuspage) directly from Datadog incidents.
- **Centralized Communication:** Sync incident updates and notifications with chat tools, ticketing platforms, and on-call systems to keep stakeholders informed.
- **Customizable Responses:** Tailor integration settings to match your organization's incident response processes, ensuring the right people and systems are engaged at the right time.

## Integration settings

You can configure and manage all incident-related integrations in the **Incident Settings** page. This includes connecting tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams to automate notifications, ticket creation, and collaboration during incidents. For more information, see [Incident Settings: Integrations][1].
