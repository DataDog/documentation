## Overview

Status Pages is a way to keep internal and external stakeholders informed during service disruptions by publishing real-time updates about system health.

This integration enables responders to publish and update status page notices directly from Incident Management.
-Eliminate context switching by managing public communications without leaving your incident workflow
-Publish notices quickly and consistently during high-severity incidents
- Keep incident timelines and public-facing updates in sync to reduce confusion and messaging mistakes
