## Overview

Datadog Incident Management integrates with popular collaboration tools, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Jira, Confluence, ServiceNow, Google Meet, and Google Drive.

## Integrations

To integrate Incident Management with a third-party application, install that application's integration in the [Datadog integrations library][13].

Then, configure the integration for Incident Management by navigating to [**Incidents > Settings > Integrations**][1].

## Slack

To use Incident Management's Slack features, you must first [install the Slack integration for Datadog][2].

After you do that, go to **[Service Management > Incidents > Settings > Integrations][1]** to configure the Slack features for Incident Management.

### Declaring incidents in Slack

When you connect a Slack workspace to a Datadog organization, users in the workspace can use slash commands and shortcuts related to Incident Management:

* `/datadog incident` declares an incident
* `/datadog incident test` declares a test incident (if test incidents are enabled for the incident type)

To allow any Slack user or non-guest Slack user to declare incidents in your Slack workspace, enable "Allow Slack users to declare incidents without a connected Datadog account" in Incident Management settings.

You can also declare incidents directly from a Slack message. To do this, mouse over the Slack message, click the "More actions" button, and then select "Declare incident". When you declare an incident in this way, Datadog posts a message to the Slack message thread indicating that you declared an incident.

### Incident channels

#### Automatic channel creation

You can configure Incident Management to automatically create an incident Slack for each incident or for incidents meeting criteria you define.

When enabling this, you can define a channel name template for Datadog to follow when creating the channel. The following variables are availble in channel name templates:

* `{{public_id}}`: Incident's numeric ID
* `{{title}}`: Incident's title
* `{{created}}`: Incident's creation date in format MM_DD_YYYY
* `{{yyyy}}`: Incident's four-digit creation year
* `{{mm}}`: Incident's two-digit creation month
* `{{dd}}`: Incident's two-digit creation day of month
* `{{random_adjective}}`: Random adjective
* `{{random_noun}}`: Random noun

#### Incident commands

The following commands can be run inside the incident Slack channel to manage the incident:

* `/datadog incident update` updates the channel's incident
* `/datadog incident private` converts the incident to a private incident (if private incidents are enabled for the incident type)
* `/datadog incident responders` allows you to add new responders and manage responder types
* `/datadog task` creates a new incident task
* `/datadog task list` shows the incident's tasks

#### Channel message syncing

You can configure Incident Management to push all incident Slack channel messages to the incident timeline. Alternatively, you can configure it to sync a Slack message only when you add a ðŸ“Œ reaction to it.

The author of a synced message does not need an Incident Management or Incident Response seat for the message to be recorded. In organizations with usage-based billing for Incident Management, the author is not be counted as a monthly active user.

#### Other incident channel features

You can configure Incident Management to:

* Push incident timeline messages to the incident Slack channel
* Add important links to the incident Slack channel's bookmarks
* Add team members to the incident channel when a Datadog team is added to the incident
* Send a notification to the Slack channel when a meeting has been started
* Automatically archive an incident Slack channel after the incident is resolved

### Other Slack features

*Send incident updates to a global channel*: You can configure Incident Management to inform a selected channel when an incident's state, severity, title, or incident commander changes.

If you want to customize this behavior, deactivate this setting and [define a notification rule][12] instead.

## Microsoft Teams

To use Incident Management's Microsoft Teams features, you must first [install the Microsft Teams integration for Datadog][14].

After you do that, go to **[Service Management > Incidents > Settings > Integrations][1]** to configure the Microsoft Teams features for Incident Management.

### Declaring incidents in Microsoft Teams

To declare an incident from a particular team, you must first [add the Datadog application to the team][15].

After doing that, you can post `@Datadog incident` to declare an incident.

### Incident channels
