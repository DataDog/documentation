## Overview

Use [Incident Settings][1] to customize aspects of the Incident Management experience for your entire organization. These settings enable you to align your usage of Incident Management with your existing processes.

## Incident types

Incident types allow you to apply different settings to different classes of incidents. The response for a security incident can be very different from the response for a service disruption. With incident types, you can customize each response. 

To create an incident type:
1. Navigate to the [Incidents Settings][1] page.
1. Click **Add Incident Type**.
1. Specify an Incident Type Name.
1. (Optional) Add a description.

## Global settings

| Setting     | Description    |
| ---  | ----------- |
| Analytics&nbsp;Dashboard | Customize the dashboard for the Analytics button on the Incidents homepage. By default, this links to the template Incident Management Overview dashboard for [Analytics][1]. |
