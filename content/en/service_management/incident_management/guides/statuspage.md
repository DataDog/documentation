## Overview

Atlassian's Statuspage conveys real-time status of an organization's services on a webpage. Enable the integration to automatically link and update your Statuspage incident within Datadog's Incident Management platform. As an Incident Commander or Responder, you can:
- Send customer facing messages with accurate and up to date information
- Update Statuspage while investigating an incident without leaving the Datadog platform
- Resolve both Datadog incidents and the linked Statuspage incident at the same time

## Prerequisites

Install the integration through the [Statuspage Integration tile][1]. For more information, see the [Statuspage integration][2] documentation.

## Setup

1. In the [Integration Settings page][3], find the Statuspage integration. 
1. Toggle **Enable Statuspage incident creation**.

## Add a Statuspage incident

1. In the [Incidents page][4], open an existing incident.
1. At the top of the incident page, click **Add a Statuspage incident**.
1. Enter all the required fields, which include Select a Statuspage, Incident name, and Incident status. You can also specify which Statuspage components are affected.
