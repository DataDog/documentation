## Overview

By connecting Zoom and Datadog, you can quickly create Zoom meetings to collaborate with your team on active incidents.

## Setup

### Installation

To install the Datadog for Zoom app:

1. In Datadog, find the Incidents Settings page under **Service Management**.
2. Go to **Integrations** and enable the **Automatically create a meeting in Zoom for every incident** toggle. This setting replaces the **Add Video Call** button with a **Start Zoom Call** button for one-click Zoom meeting creation from Datadog's incident overview page.
3. When you click the **Start Zoom Call** button, you are prompted to add the Datadog Zoom App. Be sure to allow it to view and manage information on Zoom's behalf.

## Usage

Once the app has been installed, you can click the **Start Zoom Call** button from an incident to create a new Zoom call and link it to the incident automatically.

## Permissions

Datadog for Zoom requires the following OAuth Scopes. For more information, see the [Zoom OAuth scopes documentation][2].
