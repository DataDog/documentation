Teams are the central organizational unit of [Datadog On-Call][2]. Pages are sent to a Team, and the Team's schedules or escalation policies route the Page to an appropriate Team member.

On-Call Teams are an extension of [Datadog Teams][1]. On-Call Teams are listed on the [Teams][3] overview page, alongside Teams that do not perform on-call duties. Datadog recommends that you use existing Teams for your On-Call configuration whenever possible, as this increases your On-Call Team's discoverability.

### Onboard a new or existing Team

1. Go to [**On-Call** > **Teams**][4] and select **Set Up Team**.
1. Create a new Team, select an existing Datadog Team, or import team configurations from PagerDuty or Opsgenie.

  - **Team Name**: Enter a name for your Team. Datadog recommends that you do not use acronyms here, unless the acronym is already widely used in your organization.
  - **Handle**: The handle used to page the Team throughout the Datadog platform. You can change your Team's handle at any time.
  - **Members**: Add your Team's members, including those who do not perform on-call duties.
  - **Description**: Provide a description of your Team's responsibilities. For example: _Our team is responsible for [primary responsibility]. We ensure [key objectives or activities], operating [operational hours or conditions]._

   - Datadog automatically proposes _Interrupt Handler_, _Primary_, and _Secondary_ schedules for your Team. You can define these schedules in the next step. 
   - You can also notify an existing schedule owned by another Team. 

   See [Escalation Policies][5] for more details.
1. Define the schedules created in the previous step. 
   {{< img src="service_management/oncall/schedule_blank.png" alt="Setup view of a new schedule." style="width:80%;" >}}
   - **Schedule Time Zone**: Select the time zone you want to operate your schedule in. Other settings, such as handoff times, adhere to this selection.
   - **Schedule Rotations**: Add your desired rotations.
   See [Schedules][6] for more details.

### Next steps

Configure your monitors, incidents, or other resources to send Pages to your On-Call Team. See [Send a Page][7].
