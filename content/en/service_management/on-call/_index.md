Datadog On-Call integrates monitoring, paging, and incident response into one platform.

{{< img src="service_management/oncall/oncall_overview.png" alt="Overview of how Pages are routed. From a monitor, incident, security signal, or API call, the Page is sent to a Team (e.g. 'payments-team'), then to processing rules (e.g. based on priority) then to an escalation policy. There, it can be sent to a schedule or directly to a user." style="width:100%;" >}}

## Concepts

- **Pages** represent something to get alerted for, such as a monitor, incident, or security signal. A Page can have a status of `Triggered`, `Acknowledged`, or `Resolved`.
- **Teams** are groups configured within Datadog to handle specific types of Pages, based on expertise and operational roles.
- **Processing rules** allow Teams to finely adjust their reactions to specific types of incoming events. These rules can set a Page's urgency level and route Pages to different escalation policies depending on the event's metadata.
- **Escalation policies** determine how Pages are escalated within or across Teams.
- **Schedules** set timetables for when specific Team members are on-call to respond to Pages.

## How it works

**Teams** are the central organizational unit of Datadog On-Call. When a notification is triggered in Datadog, a **Page** is sent to the designated On-Call Team.

Each Team owns **escalation policies** and **schedules**. Escalation policies define how a Page is sent to various schedules, such as _Checkout Operations - Interrupt Handler_, _Primary_, and _Secondary_ in the following screenshot. Each Team can also configure **processing rules** to route Pages to different escalation policies.

A schedule defines specific times when Team members are assigned to respond to Pages. Schedules organize and manage the availability of Team members across different time zones and shifts.
