Datadog On-Call integrates monitoring, paging, and incident response into one platform.

{{< img src="service_management/oncall/oncall_overview.png" alt="Overview of how Pages are routed. From a monitor, incident, security signal, or API call, the Page is sent to a Team (e.g. 'payments-team'), then to routing rules (e.g. based on priority) then to an escalation policy. There, it can be sent to a schedule or directly to a user." style="width:100%;" >}}

## Concepts

- **Pages** represent something to get alerted for, such as a monitor, incident, or security signal. A Page can have a status of `Triggered`, `Acknowledged`, or `Resolved`.
- **Teams** are groups configured within Datadog to handle specific types of Pages, based on expertise and operational roles.
- **Routing rules** allow Teams to finely adjust their reactions to specific types of incoming events. These rules can set a Page's urgency level and route Pages to different escalation policies depending on the event's metadata.
- **Escalation policies** determine how Pages are escalated within or across Teams.
- **Schedules** set timetables for when specific Team members are on-call to respond to Pages.

## How it works

**Teams** are the central organizational unit of Datadog On-Call. When a notification is triggered in Datadog, a **Page** is sent to the designated On-Call Team.

{{< img src="service_management/oncall/notification_page.png" alt="Notification that mentions an On-Call Team." style="width:80%;" >}}

Each Team owns **escalation policies** and **schedules**. Escalation policies define how a Page is sent to various schedules, such as _Checkout Operations - Interrupt Handler_, _Primary_, and _Secondary_ in the following screenshot. Each Team can also configure **routing rules** to route Pages to different escalation policies.

A schedule defines specific times when Team members are assigned to respond to Pages. Schedules organize and manage the availability of Team members across different time zones and shifts.

## Granular access control

Use [granular access controls][3] to limit the [roles][4], teams, or users that can access On-Call resources. By default, access to On-Call schedules, escalation policies, and team routing rules is unrestricted.

Granular access controls are available for the following On-Call resources:
- **Schedules**: Control who can view, edit, and override schedules
- **Escalation policies**: Control who can view and edit escalation policies
- **Team routing rules**: Control who can view and edit team routing rules

### Supported resources and permissions

| On-Call resource | Viewer | Overrider | Editor |
|------------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Schedules** | Can view schedules | Can view schedules and override shifts | Can view, edit schedules, and override shifts |
| **Escalation policies** | Can view escalation policies | - | Can view and edit escalation policies |
| **Team routing rules** | Can view team rules | - | Can view and edit team rules |

### Restrict access to On-Call resources

To restrict access to an On-Call resource:

1. Navigate to the specific On-Call resource (schedule, escalation policy, or team routing rules).
1. Click **Manage**.
1. Select **Permissions** from the dropdown menu.
1. Click **Restrict Access**.
1. Select one or more roles, teams, or users from the dropdown menu.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Select the level of access you want to associate with each of them from the dropdown menu next to their name:
   - **Viewer**: Read-only access to view the resource
   - **Overrider** (schedules only): Can view and create schedule overrides
   - **Editor**: Full access to view and modify the resource
1. Click **Save**.

**Note**: To maintain your edit access to the resource, Datadog requires you to include at least one role that you are a member of before saving.

## Start using Datadog On-Call

<div class="alert alert-warning">To preserve incident history, Datadog On-Call does not support deletion of resources like Pages, escalation policies, or schedules. To test On-Call without affecting your production environment, create a trial organization as a sandbox.</div>

To get started with On-Call, [onboard an On-Call Team][1] and ensure that all Team members configure their [On-Call profile settings][2] to receive notifications.
