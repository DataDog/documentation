A Page is sent to a Team and subsequently routed through that Team's escalation policies and schedules. After your Team is [onboarded to Datadog On-Call][1], you can start paging it.

### Page from notifications
You can send a Page by mentioning a Team's handle with `oncall-` prepended. For example: to send a Page to the Checkout Operations team (`@checkout-operations`), mention `@oncall-checkout-operations`.

You can send Pages to On-Call Teams wherever @-handles are supported, including monitors, Incident Management, security detection rules, Event Management, and more.

#### Monitors and dynamic urgencies

If you send a Page through a monitor alert, and your Team's processing rule uses dynamic urgencies:
- If the WARN threshold is crossed, the Page urgency is set to `low`.
- If the ALERT threshold is crossed, the Page urgency is set to `high`.

### Page manually

You can manually send a Page directly in the Datadog platform, through a tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams, or with the Datadog API.

#### Through Datadog

1. Go to [**On-Call** > **Teams**][2].
1. Find the Team you want to page. Select **Page**.
   {{< img src="service_management/oncall/manual_page.png" alt="The list of On-Call Teams, showing the Checkout Operations Team. Three buttons are displayed: Schedules, Escalation Policies, Page." style="width:80%;" >}}
1. Enter a **Page title**. You can also select **Tags** and add more context in the **Description** field. Select **Page**.

Manually paging a Team through Datadog always results in a `high` urgency Page.

#### Through Slack or Microsoft Teams
1. Install the Datadog app
1. Enter `/datadog page` or `/dd page`.
1. Select a Team to send a Page to.

Manually paging a Team from Slack or Microsoft Teams always results in a `high` urgency Page.
