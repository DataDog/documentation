Live call routing is provisioned by Datadog. To enable it for your organization, contact your account manager or <a href="mailto:support@datadoghq.com">Datadog Support</a>. Include your use case and the country and country code where you need the number provisioned (for example, <code>+1</code>, United States).

## Overview

Live call routing connects phone calls to your on-call team. When someone calls your dedicated number, the system handles the call according to your configuration. 

Datadog On-Call supports two route types:

- **Direct call routing**: Connects the caller to a live on-call responder, following the escalation policy for the on-call team. Enables real-time coordination during critical incidents.
- **Voicemail routing**: Prompts the caller to leave a voicemail, then converts the voice message to a page for the on-call team. Useful for non-technical callers or third-party vendors who need to report issues without a live conversation.

## Configuration

### Basic route settings

Each live call route includes:

- **Name**: A descriptive label, such as "Production Incidents" or "Security Escalations."
- **Phone Number**: The dedicated number provisioned by Datadog for this route.
- **Region Code**: The geographic region for the phone number (for example, `US` for the United States).
- **Active Status**: Whether the route is currently accepting calls.
- **Routing Type**: How calls are handled (see [Routing types](#routing-types)).

### Keypad options

Keypad options offer callers a menu when they dial your routing number. 

You can configure up to nine options per route. Each option maps a key (1-9) to an on-call team and triggers that team's paging process. To improve usability:
- Use option 1 for the most critical team or escalation path.
- Group related teams under adjacent keys.
- Keep menu prompts concise and clear.

## Routing types

Datadog On-Call supports two routing types: direct call routing and voicemail routing. 

### Direct call routing

In direct call routing, the system follows the on-call team's escalation policy to connect the caller to the first available responder.

Responders must have valid phone numbers in their profiles; those without are automatically skipped.

**Note:** Responders must press `1` to accept a call.

#### Escalation logic

For direct call routing, escalation proceeds as follows:

- **Multiple responders at the same level**: All responders are called simultaneously. The first to answer is connected.
- **Responder rejects a call**: The system immediately escalates to the next responder.
- **Responder has no phone number**: The system skips the responder.
- **Only one escalation level is defined**: If the responder is unreachable, the caller is informed that no one is available, and the call ends.
- **No responders have valid phone numbers**: The caller is informed that no one is available, and the call ends.

#### Best practices

- Use multi-level escalation policies to avoid dropped calls.
- Add multiple responders at critical levels for redundancy.
- Test your routing setup regularly:
  - Test each keypad option to verify it routes to the correct team.
  - Simulate escalation behavior by rejecting or not answering a call.
  - Check that responders' phone numbers are valid, reachable, and configured with appropriate voicemail settings.
  - Verify that calls successfully connect to available responders.

### Voicemail routing 

In voicemail routing, callers are prompted to leave a message. The message is transcribed and sent as a page to the on-call team.

#### Best practices

- Confirm team members have notification preferences configured to receive pages.
- Test your routing setup regularly:
  - Test each keypad option to verify it routes to the correct team.
  - Confirm that voicemail recordings are properly captured and transcribed.
  - Verify that pages are created and sent to the correct team members.

## Troubleshooting

### Route issues

If your route isn't accepting calls:
- Ensure the route is active.
- Confirm provisioning is complete.
- Verify the phone number is correctly configured.

### Keypad problems

- Ensure keypad options are linked to a valid on-call team, and test each option individually. 
- Verify that your phone system supports DTMF (touch-tone) input.

### Voicemail and page issues

If voicemail isn't converting to pages:
- For **direct call routing**: If calls fall back to voicemail or fail to page, confirm that the on-call team is properly configured and that team members have valid notification preferences in place.
- For **voicemail routing**: Confirm that your routing type is set to voicemail, the on-call team is properly configured, and team members have valid notification preferences configured to receive pages.
