Datadog provides a suite of workflow actions that are not associated with a specific tool or integration. These actions give you more control over your workflows by allowing you to do things like:
- Add logic to control the execution path of your workflow.
- Transform the data collected by an action.
- Make custom HTTP requests.

    {{< nextlink href="/service_management/workflows/actions/http" >}}Use the HTTP action to make a request to a custom endpoint.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/service_management/workflows/actions/saved_actions" >}}Use the <i>Saved Actions</i> feature to store and reuse an action and its parameters.{{< /nextlink >}}

If your use case is not covered by an integration or generic Datadog action, you can [request a new action or an entire integration][1].
