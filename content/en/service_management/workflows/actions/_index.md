Generic actions are workflow actions that are not associated with a tool or integration. If an action you need is missing from the Actions catalog, you might be able to solve your use case with a generic action.

As with all workflow actions, you can use the [context variables][1] tab to access any values available in the workflow context.

You can also [request a new action or entire integration][2].
