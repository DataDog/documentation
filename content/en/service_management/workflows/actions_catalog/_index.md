Datadog Workflow Automation provides actions that can be performed against your infrastructure and integrations. You can orchestrate and automate your end-to-end processes by linking together actions  that perfom tasks in your cloud providers, SaaS tools, and Datadog accounts. Custom actions can be built using the [HTTP action][2], and you may also [Data transformation actions][2] to perform necessary  operations on the information flowing through your workflow.
You can also leverage logic steps to control the flow of your workflow as you perform these series of actions.
Read [build workflows][1] for more information on creating a workflow.

See below for a list of all available workflow actions. Click an action to see its description, inputs, outputs, and parameters.
