Datadog Workflow Automation provides actions that can be performed against your infrastructure and integrations. You can orchestrate and automate your end-to-end processes by linking together actions for cloud providers, Datadog integrations, Datadog itself, custom HTTP requests, and more. Read [build workflows][1] for more information on creating a workflow.

See below for a list of all available workflow actions. Click an action to see its description, inputs, outputs, and parameters.
