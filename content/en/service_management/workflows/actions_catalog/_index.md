Datadog Workflow Automation provides actions that can be performed against your infrastructure and integrations. You can orchestrate and automate your end-to-end processes by linking together actions that perform tasks in your cloud providers, SaaS tools, and Datadog accounts.

In addition to the workflow actions listed below, you can:
- Use the [HTTP action][1] to make a request to any endpoint.
- Implement [data transformation actions][2] to perform necessary operations on the information flowing through your workflow.
- Leverage [logic actions][3] to control the execution path between steps in your workflow.

For information on creating workflows, see [build workflows][4].

See below for a list of all available workflow actions. Click an action to see its description, inputs, outputs, and parameters.
