The Datadog Actions Catalog provides actions that can be performed against your infrastructure and integrations using either the Workflow Automation or App Builder products. You can orchestrate and automate your end-to-end processes by linking together actions that perform tasks in your cloud providers, SaaS tools, and Datadog accounts.
