Use the status remapper processor to assign attributes as an official status to your events. For example, add an event severity level to your events with the status remapper.

Each incoming status value is mapped as follows:

* Integers from 0 to 7 map to the [Syslog severity standards][4]
* Strings beginning with **emerg** or **f** (case-insensitive) map to **emerg (0)**
* Strings beginning with **a** (case-insensitive) map to **alert (1)**
* Strings beginning with **c** (case-insensitive) map to **critical (2)**
* Strings beginning with **e** (case-insensitive)—that do not match `emerg`—map to **error (3)**
* Strings beginning with **w** (case-insensitive) map to **warning (4)**
* Strings beginning with **n** (case-insensitive) map to **notice (5)**
* Strings beginning with **i** (case-insensitive) map to **info (6)**
* Strings beginning with **d**, **trace** or **verbose** (case-insensitive) map to **debug (7)**
* Strings beginning with **o** or **s**, or matching **OK** or **Success** (case-insensitive) map to **OK**
* All others map to **info (6)**

**Note**: If multiple event status remapper processors are applied to a given event within the pipeline, only the first one (according to the pipeline's order) is taken into account.
