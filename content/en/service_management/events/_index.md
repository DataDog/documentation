## Overview

Ingest, enrich and normalize, and correlate (see public beta) your events from any source into actionable insights. Datadog automatically creates events from various products including monitors, Watchdog, and Error Tracking. You can also track events generated from the Agent and installed integrations. Event Management can also ingest events from any sources, including alert events from third parties, change requests, deployments, configuration changes.

More than 100 Datadog integrations support events collection, including [Kubernetes][1], [Docker][2], [Jenkins][3], [Chef][4], [Puppet][5], [Amazon ECS][6] or [Autoscaling][7], [Sentry][8], and [Nagios][9].
