## Overview

Event Correlation groups events based on their relationships or on user-defined configurations to reduce the number of notifications and issues identified from the environment. Use correlation and cases to: 
* Reduce alert fatigue 
* Reduce the number of tickets and notifications you receive 
* Have all affected teams to be aware of a single issue instead of working in silos
