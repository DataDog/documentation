To get you started, Datadog automatically suggests [pattern-based correlations][1] according to your environment. Click any of the recommendations to open the configuration for the recommended pattern. Configuration fields are pre-populated.

## Create a pattern

To create a pattern:
1. Navigate to [Correlation][1].
1. Click **+ Add a Pattern**, at the top of the Pattern table. This opens a pattern configuration page that displays out-of-the-box suggested patterns on the left side, and a pattern output preview on the right side. 
1. You can adjust a suggested pattern by clicking **+ Continue With Pattern**. This takes you to the pre-populated configuration page for additional tuning. Or, you can choose to create your own pattern by clicking **+ Personalize From Scratch**

First, events are deduplicated to alert based on event aggregation key. Then, alerts are correlated to a case based on configuration. 
{{< img src="service_management/events/correlation/correlation_helper.mp4" alt="When events matches defined sources, filter, they get deduplicated to alerts. Alerts are correlated based on grouping attributes, and its events are de-duplicated withint the defined time window before the process repeats in a new case. You can modify these configuration in settings" video=true >}}
For more information on how to sends events with aggregation key, see [send events to datadog][5]. Events without an aggregation key are deduped to one single alert within the timeframe.

### Suggested patterns
Suggested patterns are recommended based on your commonly used service and environment tags to help you get started with event correlation quickly. 

### Configuration
From the [correlation configuration page][2]
1. Select the event source you want to group on from the dropdown.
1. Define the grouping tags. Grouping tags are event facets. See the [advanced settings section](#advanced-settings-optional) below if you don't see the tag from the dropdown. 
**Note**: you can create facets on both event attribute and tag. To learn more, see the [facets][4] documentation. 
1. To exclude any events from the source defined above, add an event query in **Filter by these events or tags** to filter them out

### Advanced settings (optional)
1. Click **Show Advanced Settings**.
1. You can add non-alerting sources and add grouping tags to correlate events.
   
   Non-alerting source
   : is any event that is available in your Event Explorer as an event, but does not have an associated monitor or alert.
   
   Add grouping tags
   : to add new grouping tags, this is same as adding [new event facet][3]. 
1. Under **Advanced correlation logic**, you can specify the minimum number of correlated events it takes to create a case and update the timeframe.

    **Timeframe explanation**

    Correlate alerts to a case for
    : The max duration that net new alerts will be added to a case 

    Deduplicate events for those alerts for
    : The max duration for current alerts which have been correlated, but continue to flap or have not resolved. Events are deduped to the corresponding alert in the existing case before opening a new case


## Preview pattern output

Preview the possible patterns and cases your configuration would potentially create. The preview panel displays 
- the total number of ingested events(limit to the first 1000 events).
- the number of alerts that would be deduped from events.
- the number of cases that would be created based on the configuration. 

Use this data to preview the impact of your correlations and understand the expected output of a pattern.

{{< img src="service_management/events/correlation/pattern/preview_pattern_output.png" alt="Configuration for pattern-based correlation highlighting the preview panel; panel shows the number of ingested events that match your configuration, how many of those events alert, how much deduplication would occur, and the number of cases that would result." style="width:100%;" >}}

**Notes**: the default title in the preview case is the first alert in correlation. After you save a pattern, the event management case title is intelligently generated. 

## Select a Case Management destination

1. From the *Project* dropdown menu, select from an existing Case to send your grouped events to.
1. (Optional) Add a tag to resulting cases.
1. Click **Save and Activate** to activate this pattern and group events into cases.

## Update existing pattern
After you update an existing pattern, all live cases will stop processing. New events that match the pattern will create a new case.
