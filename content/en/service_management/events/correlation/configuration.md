## Overview

There are two types of correlations: 

- **Pattern-based**: you control how the events are correlated. Datadog also automatically enriches your pattern based correlation with intelligent alerts powered by ML model.
- **Intelligent (Private beta)**: uses a ML modeling approach, where Datadog automatically correlates on your behalf, without the need for any configuration.
