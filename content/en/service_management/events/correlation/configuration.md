## Overview

There are two types of correlations: 

- **Pattern-based**: you control how the events/alerts are correlated, though the information available within them. 
- **Intelligent (Private beta)**: uses a ML modeling approach, where Datadog automatically correlates on your behalf, without the need for any configuration.
