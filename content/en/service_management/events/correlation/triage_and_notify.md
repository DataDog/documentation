Event Management correlates related events and automatically consolidates them into a single case. Bring in all the context of related logs, related metrics, and alerting monitors to triage and troubleshoot issues in one place.

From the [Correlation][1] page, find the pattern you want to analyze and click **Triage Cases** at the end of the same row. You can also click **View All Cases** at the top of the page to view all cases with correlated events in [Case Management][2]. Datadog pulls in related metrics and logs so you can troubleshoot issues with all the related data in one place.

To investigate a case:
1. Open the case you are investigating.
1. From the case Overview, click **Investigation**
1. Under the *Correlations* section, you can see a list of alerts and events. 
1. Click into any of the alerts or events to view all related metrics and logs in context of the alert.
1. (Optional) Select any alerts or events you want to remove that are not related to the case.
1. Under the *Related Metrics* section, compare all related metrics or group by tags.


## Create a notification or ticket

With correlated events, you can configure one notification for a group. So, instead of having 20 notifications and 20 potential issues to investigate, you have one single case and one notification. Combine all your alerts in the Case Management Projects page. There are a few ways to group notifications in Case Management:

### Ticketing

On the Project Settings page, configure the Integrations you want your projects to send notifications to. Datadog supports the following integrations with manual and automatic ticket creation, and bi-directional syncing:
- ServiceNow
- Jira

For setup instructions, see the [Case Management Settings][3] documentation.

## Notifications

In case management, _views_ group cases based on a configured query. You can set up a notification when a case matching this query is created. Datadog supports, **Pagerduty**, **Email**, **Webhook**, **Microsoft Teams**, and **Slack**. To learn how to create a view, see the [Case Management Views][4] documentation.

**Note**: You need to reconfigure underlying monitors to remove multiple notifications. Grouping monitor events does not mute individual notifications.
