## Overview

Intelligent Correlation uses a Machine Learning modeling approach. It automatically correlates on your behalf, using underlying telemetry gathered within Datadog, and other heuristics.
## Preview Intelligent Correlation

To get started:
1. Navigate to the [Correlation][1] page. 
1. From there you can preview the intelligent correlations that are created from your organization.
1. Create and customize your views to represent how you like specific teams to triage. For instance, one view for the database team, and another for the mobile team.

## Reciving your first case

When you navigate to [Case Management][2], find a project called **Event Management - Intelligent Correlation**. From this project, you can see the views you created before and the cases created by Intelligent Correlation. 

Intelligent Correlation generates cases automatically after it finds related alerts:
