## Overview

Datadog indexes event attributes as facets that are accessible from the Event Explorer facet side-panel, analytics, and monitors.

A facet displays the distinct members of an attribute or a tag and provides basic analytics, such as the number of events represented. Facets allow you to pivot or filter your datasets based on a given attribute. To filter, select the values that you want to see.

### Create a facet

To add a facet, use the **+ Add** in the left side panel.

After you add the facet, the value of this attribute is stored for all new views, and you can use it in the search bar and facet side panels. You can also use it to group by in event monitors and graph widgets.
