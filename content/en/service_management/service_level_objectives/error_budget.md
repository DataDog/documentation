## Overview

SLO error budget alerts are threshold based and notify you when a certain percentage of your SLO's error budget has been consumed. For example, alert me if 75% of the error budget for my 7-day target is consumed. Warn me if 50% is consumed (optional).

**Note:** Error budget alerts are only available for [metric-based SLOs][1] or for [monitor-based SLOs][2] that are only composed of Metric Monitor types (Metric, Integration, APM Metric, Anomaly, Forecast, or Outlier Monitors).

For a description of key terminology around SLOs, including *error budgets*, see [Service Level Objectives][3].

## Monitor creation

1. Navigate to the [SLO status page][4].
2. Create a new SLO or edit an existing one, then click the **Save and Set Alert** button. For existing SLOs, you can also click the **Set up Alerts** button in the SLO detail side panel to take you directly to the alert configuration.
3. Select the **Error Budget** tab in **Step 1: Setting alerting conditions**.
4. Set an alert to trigger when the percentage of the error budget consumed is above the `threshold`.
over the past `target` number of days.
4. Add [Notification information][5] into the **Say what's happening** and **Notify your team** sections.
5. Click the **Save and Set Alert** button on the SLO configuration page.

### API and Terraform

You can create SLO error budget alerts using the [create-monitor API endpoint][6]. Below is an example query for an SLO monitor, which alerts when more than 75% of the error budget of an SLO is consumed. Replace *slo_id* with the alphanumeric ID of the SLO you wish to configure a burn rate alert on and replace *time_window* with one of 7d, 30d or 90d - depending on which target is used to configure your SLO:

```
error_budget("slo_id").over("time_window") > 75
```

In addition, SLO error budget alerts can also be created using the [datadog_monitor resource in Terraform][7]. Below is an example `.tf` for configuring an error budget alert for a metric-based SLO using the same example query as above.

**For provider versions v2.7.0 or earlier and v2.13.0 or later**

**Note:** SLO error budget alerts are only supported in Terraform provider v2.7.0 or earlier and in provider v2.13.0 or later. Versions between v2.7.0 and v2.13.0 are not supported.

```
resource "datadog_monitor" "metric-based-slo" {
    name = "SLO Error Budget Alert Example"
    type  = "slo alert"
    
    query = <<EOT
    error_budget("slo_id").over("time_window") > 75 
    EOT

    message = "Example monitor message"
    monitor_thresholds {
      critical = 75
    }
    tags = ["foo:bar", "baz"]
}
```
