## Overview

When creating SLOs, you can choose from the following types:
- **Metric-based SLOs**: can be used when you want the SLI calculation to be count-based, the SLI is calculated as the sum of good events divided by the sum of total events.
- **Monitor-based SLOs**: can be used when you want the SLI calculation to be time-based, the SLI is based on the Monitor's uptime. Monitor-based SLOs must be based on a new or existing Datadog monitor, any adjustments must be made to the underlying monitor (cannot be done through SLO creation).
- **Time Slice SLOs**: can be used when you want the SLI calculation to be time-based, the SLI is based on your custom uptime definition (amount of time your system exhibits good behavior divided by the total time). Time Slice SLOs do not require a Datadog monitor, you can try out different metric filters and thresholds and instantly explore downtime during SLO creation.

## Best practices for choosing an SLO Type

- Whenever possible, use metric-based SLOs. It's best practice to have SLOs where the error budget reflects the number of bad events you have left before you breach your SLO. Your SLO calculations will also be volume weighted based on the number of events.
- If, instead, you want an SLO that tracks uptime and uses a time-based SLI calculation, use time slice SLOs. Unlike monitor-based SLOs, time slice SLOs don't require you to maintain an underlying monitor for your SLO.
- Finally, consider monitor-based SLOs for use cases that are not covered by time slice SLOs, which include SLOs based on non-metric monitors or multiple monitors.
