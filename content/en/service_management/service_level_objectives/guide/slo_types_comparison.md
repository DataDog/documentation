## Overview

When creating SLOs, you can choose from the following types:
- **Metric-based SLOs**: can be used when you want the SLI calculation to be count-based, the SLI is calculated as the sum of good events divided by the sum of total events.
- **Monitor-based SLOs**: can be used when you want the SLI calculation to be time-based, the SLI is based on the Monitor's uptime. Monitor-based SLOs must be based on a new or existing Datadog monitor, any adjustments must be made to the underlying monitor (cannot be done through SLO creation).
- **Time Slice SLOs**: can be used when you want the SLI calculation to be time-based, the SLI is based on your custom uptime definition (amount of time your system exhibits good behavior divided by the total time). Time Slice SLOs do not require a Datadog monitor, you can try out different metric filters and thresholds and instantly explore downtime during SLO creation.
 
<div class="alert alert-info">The supported history duration for Metric-based and Time Slice SLOs matches your account's metric duration (by default, this is 15 months).</div>
