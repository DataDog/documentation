## Overview

Case Management provides the capability to create third-party integrations for generating notifications or tickets automatically or manually:
- Automatically: Each time a new case is created, it generates a new ticket or notification.
- Manually: Users choose to create tickets or notifications for specific cases. 

By linking Case Management with third-party systems, you can integrate Datadog solutions into your existing workflows and processes. With the Jira and ServiceNow integrations, you can resolve cases using full-stack telemetry in Datadog while keeping a record in these third-party systems.


## Notifications 

To get notified when a new case is created, create a view: 
1. Navigate to the project you want to receive notifications for.
1. If you are not already a member of the project, click **Join This Project**.
1. Click **Add view**.
1. Give the view a name in the **Name** field.
1. In the search box, enter a filtered query to retrieve the cases you want to be notified for.
1. Select how you would like to be notified within the recipients field.
1. Click **Save**.

### Notification options

| Integration     | Configuration    |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Email           | Select one or more email addresses. |
| Slack           | Select a Slack workspace and channel. |
| Microsoft Teams | If you've connected Microsoft Teams tenants to Datadog, select a tenant, team, and channel. Otherwise, select a connector.|
| PagerDuty       | Select a service. |
| Webhooks        | Select the name of a webhook. |



## Third party tickets 
In Project Settings, you can manage membership, configure the auto-closing of cases, and set up third-party integrations like Jira and ServiceNow. 

### Jira

1. Ensure the Jira integration is configured. 
1. In Case Management project settings, enable **Jira** for manual Jira issue creation from the project. 
1. Select a Jira account, a project to create issues in, and the desired issue type (such as story, epic, bug, or task). 
1. You can opt into the automatic creation of a Jira issue for each case created in the project. 
1. For the following attributes—case title, description, assignee, comments, status, and priority—select one of the options below:
  | Option     | Description    | 
  | ---  | ----------- | 
  |Once to Jira at case creation|The field syncs from Case Management to Jira only at the time the case is created. Subsequent changes are not reflected on either side.|
  |Two-way sync (bi-directional)|Changes in Case Management are reflected in Jira, and vice versa|
  |Don't sync|The field does not sync to Jira.|
1. For case status and priority, select which values they map to on the Jira side. 
1. Save changes.

**Note**: A case can only be synced with one external resource at a time, per project. To enable Jira syncing, ServiceNow automatic creation and syncing must be disabled.

### ServiceNow

1. Configure the ServiceNow integration by following the [ITOM and ITSM setup instructions][2]. 
1. In Case Management project settings, enable ServiceNow for manual ServiceNow incident creation from the project. 
1. Select a ServiceNow instance and assignment group. 
1. You can opt into the automatic creation of a ServiceNow incident for each case created in the project.
1. For the following attributes—status, comments—select one of the options below:
  | Option     | Description    | 
  | ---  | ----------- | 
  |Once to ServiceNow at case creation|The field syncs from Case Management to ServiceNow only at the time the case is created. Subsequent changes are not reflected on either side.|
  |All updates to ServiceNow |Changes in Case Management are reflected in ServiceNow, but changes in ServiceNow are not reflected in Case Management.|
  |Two-way sync (bi-directional)|Changes in Case Management are reflected in ServiceNow, and vice versa.|
  |Don't sync|The field does not sync to ServiceNow.|
1. Select ServiceNow state values that Case Management status values should map to.
1. Save changes.

**Note**: A case can only be synced with one external resource at a time, per project. To enable ServiceNow syncing, Jira automatic creation and syncing must be disabled.
