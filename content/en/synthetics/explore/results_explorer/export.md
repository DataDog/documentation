## Overview

You can export the test runs table from the Results Explorer by clicking **Download as CSV**:

{{< img src="continuous_testing/explorer/export_csv.png" alt="Export your test runs to CSV in the Synthetic Monitoring & Testing Results Explorer" style="width:100%;" >}}

Use this to generate raw test run data in bulk for debugging, reporting, and integrating with systems outside of Datadog. 

Up to 100,000 rows can be exported at a time.

This can be used to export CI batches as well.
