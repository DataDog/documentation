## Overview

Once you've started collecting data for your Synthetic tests, you can leverage Datadog platform capabilities to visualize, monitor, and analyze data across Synthetic testing and monitoring, and the rest of your connected stack. 

## Create and view dashboards
Use [dashboards][1] to track, analyze, and display key performance and usage metrics from your synthetics tests.

## View monitors
View associated [monitors][2] that are automatically created from your synthetics tests to notify your teams, and manage alerts at a glance on the Alerting platform.
