## Overview

Some parts of your systems might not be available to robots without the right identification, or you might want to avoid collecting analytics from Datadog robots. You can use the below methods to detect Datadog Synthetic Monitoring robots.

## IP addresses

You can use the **Synthetic Monitoring IP ranges** corresponding to each Datadog managed location:

```
https://ip-ranges.{{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}/synthetics.json
```

**Note:** IPs listed use the CIDR notation and may require conversion to IPv4 address ranges before use.

**Note:** Except in the case of new managed locations IPs, the listed IPs rarely change. That being said, if you want to be alerted when the listed IPs change, you can create an API test on the above endpoint with a JSONPath assertion like `$.synthetics['prefixes_ipv4_by_location']['aws:ap-northeast-1'].length`.

## Default headers

You can also identify Datadog robots by using some of the **default headers** attached to the requests generated by Synthetic tests:

### `user-agent`

A `user-agent` header is added to all requests performed by Synthetic tests. 

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Single and multistep API tests" %}}

For single and multistep API tests, the `user-agent` header is `Datadog/Synthetics`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Browser tests" %}}

For browser tests, the value of the `user-agent` header varies depending on the browser and device executing the test. The `user-agent` value always ends with `Datadog/Synthetics` to allow you to identify Synthetic tests.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### sec-datadog

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Single and multistep API tests" %}}

`sec-datadog: Request sent by a Datadog Synthetics API Test (https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) - test_id: <SYNTHETIC_TEST_PUBLIC_ID>`

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Browser tests" %}}

`Sec-Datadog: Request sent by a Datadog Synthetics Browser Test (https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) - test_id: <SYNTHETIC_TEST_PUBLIC_ID>`

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### APM headers

A number of [**other APM specific headers**][1] such as `x-datadog-origin: synthetics` is also added to requests generated by Synthetic API and browser tests.

## Customize requests

You can also leverage your API and browser test configuration **Advanced options** to add specific identifiers to your tests' requests. You can for instance add **custom headers**, **cookies**, or **request bodies**.

## Browser variable

<div class="alert alert-warning">
In some cases, the browser variable cannot be applied. The browser variable method is consequently deprecated and it is now recommended to leverage the `user-agent` header instead.
</div>

When a Datadog robot is rendering your application, the `window._DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_BROWSER` variable is set to `true`. To remove the robot actions from your analytics data, wrap your analytics tool code with the following test:

```javascript
if (window._DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_BROWSER === undefined) {
  initializeAnalytics()
}
```
