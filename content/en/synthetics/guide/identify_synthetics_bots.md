## Overview

Some parts of your systems might not be available to robots without the right identification, or you might want to avoid collecting analytics from Datadog robots. You can use the below methods to detect Datadog Synthetic Monitoring robots.

## IP addresses

You can use the **Synthetic Monitoring IP ranges** corresponding to each Datadog managed location:

```
https://ip-ranges.{{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}/synthetics.json
```

**Note:** IPs listed use the CIDR notation and may require conversion to IPv4 address ranges before use.

## Default headers

You can also identify Datadog robots by using some of the **default headers** attached to the requests generated by API and browser tests:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "API Tests" %}}

The following header is attached to all Datadog API tests robots:

`sec-datadog: Request sent by a Datadog Synthetic API Test (https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) - test_id: <SYNTHETIC_TEST_PUBLIC_ID>`

A `user-agent: Datadog/Synthetics` is also added.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Browser tests" %}}

The following header is attached to all Datadog browser tests robots:

`Sec-Datadog: Request sent by a Datadog Synthetic Browser Test (https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) - test_id: <SYNTHETIC_TEST_PUBLIC_ID>`

A `user-agent` header with a value that varies depending on the type of browser test run (browser, device) is also added.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### APM headers

A number of [**other APM specific headers**][1] such as `x-datadog-origin: synthetics` is also added to requests generated by Synthetic API and browser tests.

## Customize requests

You can also leverage your API and browser test configuration **Advanced options** to add specific identifiers to your tests' requests. You can for instance add **custom headers**, **cookies**, or **request bodies**.

## Browser variable

When a Datadog robot is rendering your application, the `window._DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_BROWSER` variable is set to `true`. To remove the robot actions from your analytics data, wrap your analytics tool code with the following test:

```javascript
if (window._DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_BROWSER === undefined) {
  initializeAnalytics()
}
```
