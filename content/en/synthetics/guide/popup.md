## Modals

### JavaScript

Synthetic browser tests automatically handle [JavaScript modals][1]:
 - `alert` modals are closed. 
 - `prompt` and `confirm` modals are answered `Lorem Ipsum`.

### Basic auth

For Basic auth popups, specify the associated credentials in your browser test configuration, in [**Advanced Options > HTTP Auth**][2]:

## Application popups

### Anchored popups

If a popup appears at a specific point of your journey, you can record a step to close it and allow this step to fail using the [corresponding option][3]. This way, your test knows how to behave in case a popup appears. If the popup does not show up, the step fails without causing the whole test to fail.

### Moving popups

If the time at which these popups appear in a session is not predictable, check with the third party providing the popup to see if they can create a rule that prevents the popup from appearing during your browser test execution. They could, for example, provide you with a cookie that you can input below the [dedicated **Advanced option**][2] of your test.

Alternatively, use one of these methods to ensure your popup is closed and your test is able to continue its journey:
  * Create a [JavaScript assertion][4] at the beginning of your browser test to regularly try to close the popup:

    ```javascript
    if (document.querySelector("<ELEMENT>")) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const isPopupDisplayed = () => {
          if (document.querySelector("<ELEMENT>")) {
            clearInterval(popup);
            resolve(true);
          }
        };
        let popup = setInterval(isPopupDisplayed, 500);
      });
    }
    ```

  * Record steps to close the popup, add them between all your other browser test steps, and select the [**Allow this step to fail** option][3] for each of them.
