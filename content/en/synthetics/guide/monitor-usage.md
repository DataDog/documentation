Synthetic tests come with [estimated usage metrics][1] that allow you to keep track of your usage. These metrics notably enable you to:

* Understand how your usage evolves over time.
* Visualize which teams, applications, or services are contributing the most to your Synthetics usage and have the largest coverage.
* Alert on unexpected usage spikes that can impact your billing.

To visualize or alert on your Synthetics usage, use the following queries:

* [Single][2] and [Multistep API tests][3]: `sum:datadog.estimated_usage.synthetics.api_test_runs{*}.as_count()`

* [Browser tests][4]: `sum:datadog.estimated_usage.synthetics.browser_test_runs{*}.as_count()`.

For a higher level of refinement, scope or group these metrics by tags associated with your test, such as `team` or `application`. 

You can graph and monitor these metrics against static thresholds as well as use machine learning based algorithms like [anomaly detection][5] or [forecast][6] to ensure you do not get alerted for expected usage growth.
