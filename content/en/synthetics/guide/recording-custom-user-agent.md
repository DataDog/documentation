Some implementations lead applications to render a certain way only when using a specific `User-Agent` string (for example, when using a mobile `User-Agent`). In these cases, you need to set the `User-Agent` header to a custom string to be able to record your browser tests' steps in your application. To do so:

1. Open your application in a pop up by clicking on **Open in Popup** in your browser test recorder.
2. Open your Chrome Developer Tools.
3. Click on the menu button with the three vertical dots.
4. Select the **More tools - Network conditions** option.
5. Go to the **Network conditions** tab and disable the **Select automatically** option.
6. Choose **Custom** and enter the `User-Agent` string of interest.

**Note:** You can override the [default `User-Agent` string][1] at test execution time by adding it as a header in your test configuration.
