## Overview

This guide describes how you can avoid caching issues while using Synthetic tests.

## API tests

### HTTP tests

You can leverage [local variables][1] to generate a random string and send it with your payload to ensure your [HTTP tests][2] do not use your caching systems.

## Browser tests

Browsers are killed after every test execution, which ensures that your browser tests do not experience cache-related issues on the client side.
