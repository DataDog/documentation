Some parts of your system might not be available to robots without the right identification, or you might want to avoid collecting analytics from Datadog robots. Use the headers added to Synthetics tests to spot Datadog robots and filter their requests once in your analytics tool. The following header is automatically added to all requests generated by Datadog API tests:

`x-abuse-info: Request sent by a Datadog Synthetics API Check (https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) - check_id: <CHECK_ID>`

If APM is enabled, [**other APM specific headers**][1] such as `x-datadog-trace-id` are added to all the requests launched for API tests.

**Note**: No headers are added by default for browser tests.

If you want these requests to be completely removed and not sent at all to your analytics tool, use the JavaScript variable below in your website wrapped around your analytics tool code snippet:

```
if (window._DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_BROWSER === undefined) {
  initializeAnalytics()
}
```

Alternatively, there are other ways to flag Datadog Synthetics robots:

* You can use the **Advanced options** to set custom headers for your API and Browser tests.

* You can locally add **cookies, headers or basic auth** to your API tests and **cookies and headers** to your Browser tests.

* You can use Datadog's [**Synthetics IP ranges**][2].
