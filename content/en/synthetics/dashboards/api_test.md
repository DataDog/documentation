## Overview

The [API test performance dashboard][1] provides insights about your entire stack and events. It shows:

- **API test types**: View your network levels' average response time, latency, or lookup time, along with transaction timings and response time by location by test type.

- **Events**: View events triggered for all of your API tests and filter for specific tests using the template variables at the top of the dashboard.
