## Overview

When you create a Synthetic test, Datadog [collects data][1] and generates dashboards about your stack, browser applications, or overall tests' performance, private locations, and events. 

Access your Synthetic dashboards by filtering for `Synthetics` in the search query of the [**Dashboard List**][2] or by clicking on the dropdown menu under [**Dashboards**][3] on the [Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing page][4].

## Customize your Synthetic dashboards

You can clone [dashboards][5] and customize them by team, environment, or region using template variables. You can also customize your view and create a [saved view][6] of your cloned dashboard.

### Edit template variables

The generated Synthetic dashboards automatically contain a set of default template variables. Use the template variable dropdown menus to narrow the data shown in the dashboard. For example, you can filter for a specific browser type with the `Browser` template variable. For more information, see the [Template Variables][7] documentation. To clone your Synthetic dashboard, click the **Clone** button next to the **Configure** icon.

The Synthetic dashboard has a default view which you can adjust. Click the **Edit** icon to enter edit mode and customize your template variables.

### Create a saved view

Once you are done editing, click **Done** and select **Save selections as view** from the left hand dropdown menu.

Enter a name for your saved view and click **Save**.
