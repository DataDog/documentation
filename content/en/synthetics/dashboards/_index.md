## Overview

When you create a Synthetic test, Datadog [collects data][1] and generates dashboards about your stack, browser applications, or overall tests' performance, private locations, and events. 

Access your Synthetic dashboards by filtering for `Synthetics` in the search query of the [**Dashboard List**][2] or by clicking on the dropdown menu under [**Dashboards**][3] on the [Synthetic Monitoring homepage][4].

## Interact with Synthetic dashboards

You can clone [dashboards][5] and customize them by team, environment, or region using template variables.

### Template variables

The generated Synthetic dashboards automatically contain a set of default template variables. Use the template variable dropdown menus to narrow the data shown in the dashboard. For example, you can filter for a specific browser type with the `Browser` template variable.

### Saved views

The Synthetic dashboard has a default view. To adjust the dashboard view, click the **Edit** icon and customize your template variables. 

Once you are done editing, click **Save** and select **Save selections as view** from the left hand dropdown menu. Enter a name for your saved view and click **Save**.

### Customize dashboards

To clone your Synthetic dashboard, click the **Settings** icon and select **Clone dashboard**. To add more widgets, powerpacks, or apps, scroll down to the bottom and click the **+** icon.
