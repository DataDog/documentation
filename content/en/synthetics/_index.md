<br/>

Synthetic tests allow you to observe how your systems and applications are performing using **simulated requests and actions from around the globe**. Datadog tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels (`HTTP`, `SSL`, `DNS`, `WebSocket`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, and `gRPC`) in a controlled and stable way, alerting you about faulty behavior such as regressions, broken features, high response times, and unexpected status codes. 

**Computing SLOs** on your key endpoints and user journeys makes it easier to stick to your application performance targets and ultimately provide a consistent customer experience.

You can create Synthetic tests in the [Datadog application][1], with the [API][2], or with [Terraform][3].

## Set up API tests and multistep API tests

API tests allow you to launch [single][4] or [chained][5] requests to perform verifications on your key systems at various network levels: [HTTP test][6], [SSL test][7], [DNS test][8], [WebSocket test][9], [TCP test][10], [UDP test][11], [ICMP test][12], and [gRPC test][13].

## Record browser tests

Use [Synthetic browser tests][14] to monitor how your customers experience your webpages end-to-end from around the world.

## Record mobile application tests

Use [Synthetic mobile application tests][21] to monitor how your customers experience your iOS and Android applications end-to-end from different device types.

## Launch private locations

Use [Synthetic private locations][15] to monitor internal APIs and websites or create custom locations in areas that are mission-critical to your business.

## Connect data and traces

Use the [integration between Synthetic tests and APM traces][16] to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network, and backend requests.

{{< img src="synthetics/synthetics_traces.mp4" alt="Synthetic Monitoring" video=true style="width:100%;">}}

## Access out-of-the-box dashboards

Analyze performance information about your API tests, multistep API tests, browser tests, and private locations, as well as Datadog events, with [out-of-the-box Synthetic dashboards][17]. 

{{< img src="synthetics/dashboards/test_dashboard.png" alt="Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing Summary Dashboard" style="width:100%;">}}

## Use the Synthetic Monitoring & Testing Results Explorer

Create [search queries and visualizations][20] for your Synthetic test runs or batches of tests running in CI/CD pipelines. 

{{< img src="continuous_testing/explorer_ci_batches_1.png" alt="Continuous Testing Explorer" style="width:100%;">}}

## Track testing coverage

Optimize your test suite by [ensuring that your application's most critical workflows are being tested][22].

## Ready to start?

See [Getting Started with Synthetic Monitoring][18] for instructions on creating your first Synthetic test and monitoring your web applications. Then, explore [Getting Started with Private Locations][19] for instructions on creating your private location and running Synthetic tests with your private location.
