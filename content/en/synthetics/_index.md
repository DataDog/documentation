Synthetic tests allow you to observe how all your systems are performing as experienced by your users from around the globe -  Datadog tracks the performance of your applications and API endpoints using simulated user requests and browser rendering. Synthetics helps you ensure uptime, identify regional issues, compute error budgets, automate tests, and track application performance. By unifying Synthetics with your metrics, traces, and logs, you can test your production environment end-to-end.

## Getting Started

### Connect Synthetics and Traces

[Link simulated API tests][7] to traces to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network and backend requests.
