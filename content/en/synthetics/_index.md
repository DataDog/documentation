  Explore and register for Foundation Enablement sessions. Learn how Datadog Synthetic Monitoring is a proactive monitoring solution that enables you to create code-free API, browser, and mobile tests to automatically simulate user flows and requests to your applications, key endpoints, and network layers.
{{< /learning-center-callout >}}

Synthetic tests allow you to observe how your systems and applications are performing using **simulated requests and actions from around the globe**. Datadog tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels (`HTTP`, `SSL`, `DNS`, `WebSocket`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, and `gRPC`) in a controlled and stable way, alerting you about faulty behavior such as regressions, broken features, high response times, and unexpected status codes. 

**Computing SLOs** on your key endpoints and user journeys makes it easier to stick to your application performance targets and ultimately provide a consistent customer experience.

You can create Synthetic tests in the [Datadog application][1], with the [API][2], or with [Terraform][3].

## Set up API tests and multistep API tests

API tests allow you to launch [single][4] or [chained][5] requests to perform verifications on your key systems at various network levels: [HTTP test][6], [SSL test][7], [DNS test][8], [WebSocket test][9], [TCP test][10], [UDP test][11], [ICMP test][12], and [gRPC test][13]. 

{{< img src="synthetics/api_test.png" alt="API tests" style="width:100%;">}}

## Record browser tests

Use [Synthetic browser tests][14] to monitor how your customers experience your webpages end-to-end from around the world.

{{< img src="synthetics/browser_test.mp4" alt="Browser tests" video=true style="width:100%;">}}

## Record mobile application tests

Use [Synthetic mobile application tests][21] to monitor how your customers experience your iOS and Android applications end-to-end from different device types.

{{< img src="synthetics/mobile_app_tests.png" alt="Examples of the recording workflow for a Synthetic Mobile Test" style="width:100%;">}}

## Create network path tests

Create [Synthetic network path tests][25] from managed locations to perform TCP, UDP, and ICMP checks and visualize packet routes across global endpoints.

{{< img src="synthetics/network_tests/syn_network_path.png" alt="Examples of a Synthetic TCP network test" style="width:100%;">}}

## Launch private locations

Use [Synthetic private locations][15] to monitor internal APIs and websites or create custom locations in areas that are mission-critical to your business.

{{< img src="synthetics/private_locations.png" alt="Private locations" style="width:100%;">}}

## Connect data and traces

Use the [integration between Synthetic tests and APM traces][16] to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network, and backend requests.

{{< img src="synthetics/synthetics_traces.mp4" alt="Synthetic Monitoring" video=true style="width:100%;">}}

## Access out-of-the-box dashboards

Analyze performance information about your API tests, multistep API tests, browser tests, and private locations, as well as Datadog events, with [out-of-the-box Synthetic dashboards][17]. 

{{< img src="synthetics/dashboards/test_dashboard.png" alt="Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing Summary Dashboard" style="width:100%;">}}

## Use the Synthetic Monitoring & Testing Results Explorer

Create [search queries and visualizations][20] for your Synthetic test runs or batches of tests running in CI/CD pipelines. 

{{< img src="continuous_testing/explorer_ci_batches_1.png" alt="Continuous Testing Explorer" style="width:100%;">}}

## Track testing coverage

Optimize your test suite by [ensuring that your application's most critical workflows are being tested][22].

{{< img src="synthetics/test_coverage/test_coverage.png" alt="Continuous Testing Explorer" style="width:100%;">}}

## Synthetic Monitoring notifications

Use and enrich Synthetic monitors to send notifications when a Synthetic Monitoring test is failing. The following features are available:

Pre-filled monitor messages
: Pre-filled monitor messages provide a structured starting point for Synthetic test alerts. Each message includes a standardized title, summary, and footer containing test metadata, making it easier to understand the alert at a glance.

Template variables
: Template variables let you inject test-specific data into monitor notifications dynamically. These variables pull from the `synthetics.attributes` object.

Advanced usage
: Advanced usage includes techniques for surfacing deeper test insights or structuring complex messages using handlebars templating.

Conditional alerting
: Conditional alerting allows you to change the content of a monitor notification based on specific test results or failure conditions.

For more information, see [Synthetic Monitoring notifications][24].

## Version History

Use [Version History in Synthetic Monitoring][23] to run a previous version of a test, restore your test to any saved version, or clone a version to create a new Synthetic Monitoring test.

## Ready to start?

See [Getting Started with Synthetic Monitoring][18] for instructions on creating your first Synthetic test and monitoring your web applications. Then, explore [Getting Started with Private Locations][19] for instructions on creating your private location and running Synthetic tests with your private location.
