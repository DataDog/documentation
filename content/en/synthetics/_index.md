<br/>

Synthetic tests allow you to observe how your systems and applications are performing using **simulated requests and actions from around the globe**. Datadog tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels (`HTTP`, `TCP`, `SSL`, `DNS`, and `ICMP`) in a controlled and stable way, alerting you in case of faulty behavior (regression, broken feature, high response time, unexpected status code, etc.). 

With **end-to-end testing in production and CI environments**, your development teams can proactively ensure that no defective code makes it to production. **Computing SLOs** on your key endpoints and user journeys makes it easier to stick to your application performance targets and ultimately provide a consistent customer experience.

## Set up API tests and multistep API tests

API tests allow you to launch [single][1] or [chained][2] requests to perform verifications on your key systems at various network levels: [HTTP test][8], [SSL test][9], [TCP test][10], [DNS test][11], and [ICMP test][12].

## Record browser tests

Use [Synthetic browser tests][3] to monitor how your customers experience your webpages from around the world with end-to-end tests.

## Launch private locations

Use [Synthetic private locations][4] to monitor internal APIs and websites or create custom locations in areas that are mission-critical to your business.

## Run tests with your integration and deployment processes

Leverage your Synthetic tests as [canaries][5] or run them directly within your [CI pipelines][5] to start shipping without fear that faulty code may impact your customers' experience.

## Connect data and traces

Use the [out of the box integration between Synthetic tests and APM traces][6] to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network, and backend requests.

## Ready to start?

See [Getting Started with Synthetic Monitoring][7] for instructions on creating your first Synthetic test and monitoring your web applications. Then, explore [Getting Started with Private Locations][13] for instructions on creating your private location and running Synthetic tests with your private location.
