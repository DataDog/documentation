Synthetic tests allow you to observe how your systems and applications are performing using **simulated requests and actions from around the globe**. Datadog **tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs** from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels (`HTTP`, `TCP`, `SSL`, and `DNS`) in a controlled and stable way, alerting you in case of faulty behavior (regression, broken feature, high response time, unexpected status code, etc.). **End-to-end testing production and CI environments** increases development teamsâ€™ speed as it puts an end to the fear of defective code making it to production. **Computing SLOs** on your key endpoints and user journeys makes it easier to stick to your application performance targets and ultimately provide a consistent customer experience.

## Getting Started
Create your first Synthetic test and start monitoring web applications to improve their performance in just a few minutes.

### Set up API tests and Multistep API tests

API tests allow you to launch [single][1] or [chained][2] requests to perform verifications on your key systems at various network levels: `HTTP`, `TCP`, `SSL`, and `DNS`. Create your first [HTTP test][3], [TCP test][4], [SSL test][5], or [DNS test][6] to get started with API and network monitoring.

### Record Browser tests

Record end-to-end tests to monitor how your customers experience your webpages from around the world using [Synthetic browser tests][7].

### Launch Private Locations

Use [Synthetic private locations][8] to monitor internal APIs and websites or to create custom locations in areas that are mission-critical to your business.

### Run tests with your integration and deployment processes

Leverage your Synthetic tests as [canaries][9] or run them directly within your [CI pipelines][9] to start shipping without fearing faulty code might impact your customers experience.

### Connect Synthetic Monitoring data and traces

Use the [out of the box integration between Synthetic tests and APM traces][10] to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network and backend requests.
