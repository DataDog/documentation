Synthetic tests allow you to observe how your systems and applications are performing using **simulated requests and actions from around the globe**. Datadog **tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs** from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels (HTTP, TCP, SSL) in a controlled and stable way, alerting you in case of faulty behavior (regression, broken feature, high response time, unexpected status code, etc.). **End-to-end testing production and CI environments** increases development teamsâ€™ speed as it puts an end to the fear of defective code making it to production. **Computing SLOs** on your key endpoints and user journeys makes it easier to stick to your application performance targets and ultimately provide a consistent customer experience. 

## Getting Started
Create your first Synthetic test and start monitoring web applications to improve their performance in just a few minutes.
### Set up API tests

API tests allow you to launch requests and perform verifications on your web applications at various network levels: HTTP, TCP, SSL. Create your first [HTTP test][1], TCP test, and [SSL test][2] to get started with API and network monitoring.

### Record Browser tests

Record end-to-end tests to monitor how your customers experience your webpages from around the world using [Synthetics Browser tests][3].

### Launch Private Locations

Use [Synthetics Private Locations][4] to monitor internal APIs and websites or to create custom locations in areas that are mission-critical to your business.

### Run tests with your integration and deployment processes

Leverage your Synthetic tests as [canaries][5] or run them directly within your [CI pipelines][5] to start shipping without fearing faulty code might impact your customers experience.

### Connect Synthetics and traces

Use the [out of the box integration between Synthetic tests and APM traces][6] to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network and backend requests.
