## Metrics

The following metrics are generated by Synthetic Monitoring tests.

Metrics starting with:

* `synthetics.api.*` come from your [API tests][1]
* `synthetics.http.*` come from your API [HTTP tests][2]
* `synthetics.ssl.*` come from your API [SSL tests][3]
* `synthetics.dns.*` come from your API [DNS tests][4]
* `synthetics.tcp.*` come from your API [TCP tests][5]
* `synthetics.browser.*` come from your [browser tests][6]
