## Overview

The following metrics are generated by Synthetic Monitoring tests and Continuous Testing settings.

Metrics starting with:

* `synthetics.test_runs` come from all your Synthetic tests
* `datadog.estimated_usage.synthetics.*` return relevant usage data from your Synthetic tests
* `synthetics.on_demand` return relevant usage data for [Continuous Testing](#continuous-testing)

Metrics starting with:

* `synthetics.api.*` come from your [API tests][1]
    * `synthetics.http.*` come from your API [HTTP tests][2]
    * `synthetics.ssl.*` come from your API [SSL tests][3]
    * `synthetics.dns.*` come from your API [DNS tests][4]
    * `synthetics.websocket.*` come from your API [WebSocket tests][5]
    * `synthetics.tcp.*` come from your API [TCP tests][6]
    * `synthetics.udp.*` come from your API [UDP tests][7]
    * `synthetics.icmp.*` come from your API [ICMP tests][8]
* `synthetics.multi.*` come from your [multistep API tests][9]
* `synthetics.browser.*` come from your [browser tests][10]
* `synthetics.pl.worker.*`come from your [private locations][11]
