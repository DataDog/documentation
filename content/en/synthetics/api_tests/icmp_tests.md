## Overview

ICMP tests allow you to monitor the availability of your hosts and diagnose network communication issues. By asserting on the values received from one or more ICMP pings to your endpoint, Datadog can help detect connectivity issues, above-quota latency for round trip times, and unexpected changes in security firewall configuration. The tests can also track the number of network hops (TTL) required to connect to your host and view traceroute results to discover details on each network hop along the path.

ICMP tests can run from both [managed](#select-locations) and [private locations][1] depending on whether you want to trigger ICMP pings to your endpoints from outside or inside your network. You can run ICMP tests on a defined schedule, on demand, or from within your [CI/CD pipelines][2].

## Configuration

You may create a test using one of the following options:

   - **Create a test from a template**:

       1. Hover over one of the pre-populated templates and click **View Template**. This opens a side panel displaying pre-populated configuration information, including: Test Details, Request Details, Assertions, Alert Conditions, and Monitor Settings.
       2. Click **+Create Test** to open the **Define Request** page, where you can review and edit the pre-populated configuration options. The fields presented are identical to those available when creating a test from scratch.
       3. Click **Save Details** to submit your API test.<br /><br>

   - **Build a test from scratch**:

      1. To build a test from scratch, click the **+ Start from scratch** template, then select the `ICMP` request type.
      1. Specify the **Domain Name** or **IP address** to run your test on.
      1. Select or deselect **Track number of network hops (TTL)**. When selected, this option turns on a "traceroute" probe to discover all gateways along the path to the host destination.
      1. Select the **Number of Pings** to trigger per test session. By default, the number of pings is set to four. You can choose to decrease this number or increase it up to ten.
      1. **Name** your ICMP test.
      1. Add Environment **Tags** as well as any other tags to your ICMP test. You can then use these tags to filter through your Synthetic tests on the [Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing page][3].
      1. Click **Test Host** to try out the request configuration. A response preview is displayed on the right side of your screen.<br /><br>

      8. Click **Create Test** to submit your API test.

### Define assertions

Assertions define what an expected test result is. After you click **Test URL**, basic assertions on `latency`, `packet loss`, and `packet received` are added. You must define at least one assertion for your test to monitor.

| Type          | Aggregation    |Operator                                                                               | Value Type       |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| latency         | `avg`, `max`, `min`, or `stddev` (aka `jitter`) |`is less than`, `is less than or equal`, <br> `is`, `is more than`, `is more than or equal` | _integer (ms)_    |
| packet loss     | - |`is less than`, `is less than or equal`, `is`, `is more than`, `is more than or equal` | _percentage (%)_ |
| packet received | - |`is less than`, `is less than or equal`, `is`, `is more than`, `is more than or equal` | _integer_        |
| network hops    | - |`is less than`, `is less than or equal`, `is`, `is more than`, `is more than or equal` | _integer_        |

You can create up to 20 assertions per API test by selecting **New Assertion** or by selecting the response preview directly:

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/icmp_assertion.png" alt="Define assertions for your ICMP test to succeed or fail on" style="width:90%;" >}}

If a test does not contain an assertion on the response body, the body payload drops and returns an associated response time for the request within the timeout limit set by the Synthetics Worker.

If a test contains an assertion on the response body and the timeout limit is reached, an `Assertions on the body/response cannot be run beyond this limit` error appears.

### Select locations

Select the **Locations** to run your ICMP test from. ICMP tests can run from both managed and [private locations][1] depending on your preference for triggering trigger the ICMP pings from outside or inside your network.

### Specify test frequency

ICMP tests can run:

* **On a schedule** to ensure your most important services are always accessible to your users. Select the frequency at which you want Datadog to run your ICMP test.
* [**Within your CI/CD pipelines**][2].
* **On-demand** to run your tests whenever makes the most sense for your team.

### Use variables

You can use the [global variables defined on the **Settings** page][8] in the URL and assertions of your ICMP tests.

To display your list of variables, type `{{` in your desired field.

## Test failure

A test is considered `FAILED` if it does not satisfy one or more assertions or if the request prematurely failed. In some cases, the test can fail without testing the assertions against the endpoint.

These reasons include the following:

`DNS`
: DNS entry not found for the test URL. Possible causes include misconfigured test URL or the wrong configuration of your DNS entries.

## Permissions

By default, only users with the [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][9] can create, edit, and delete Synthetic ICMP tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic ICMP tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][9].

If you are using the [custom role feature][10], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.
