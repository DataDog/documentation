## Overview

gRPC tests allow you to proactively monitor your gRPC services and servers. You can choose from two types:

Behavior Checks
: Send gRPC requests to your applications' API endpoints to verify responses and defined conditions, such as overall response time, header, or body content.

Health Checks
: gRPC health checks are a standard for reporting the health of gRPC services. Determine if your gRPC servers and services are responsive, running, and capable of handling remote procedure calls (RPCs).<br><br>By implementing gRPC health checks, you can run gRPC health checks tests without having to provide a `.proto` file to Datadog. For more information, see the [example health checks `.proto` file][1] shared by the gRPC community.

gRPC tests can run from both [managed](#select-locations) and [private locations][2] depending on your preference for running the test from outside or inside your network. gRPC tests can run on a schedule, on-demand, or directly within your [CI/CD pipelines][3].

## Configuration 

You may create a test using one of the following options:

   - **Create a test from a template**:

       1. Hover over one of the pre-populated templates and click **View Template**. This opens a side panel displaying pre-populated configuration information, including: Test Details, Request Details, Assertions, Alert Conditions, and Monitor Settings.
       2. Click **+Create Test** to open the **Define Request** page, where you can review and edit the pre-populated configuration options. The fields presented are identical to those available when creating a test from scratch.
       3. Click **Save Details** to submit your API test.<br /><br>
          {{< img src="getting_started/synthetics/synthetics_templates_api_video.mp4" alt="Video of Synthetics API test landing page with templates" video="true" >}}

   - **Build a test from scratch**:

       1. To build a test from scratch, click the **+ Start from scratch** template, then select the `gRPC` request type.
       2. Specify the **Host** and **Port** to run your test on. The default gRPC port is `50051`.
       3. Select **Behavior Check** to perform a unary call or **Health Check** to perform a health check.<br /><br>

      {{< tabs >}}
      {{% tab "Behavior Check" %}}

For a behavior check, specify the **Server Reflection** or [upload a **Proto File**][101] that defines your gRPC server. Select a method and include a request message. Datadog does not support streaming methods.<br /><br>

      {{% /tab %}}
      {{% tab "Health Check" %}}

For a health check, enter the name of the service. Leave this field blank if you want to send a health check on the gRPC server.<br /><br>

      {{% /tab %}}
      {{< /tabs >}}

   4. Add **Advanced Options** (optional) to your test:

      {{< tabs >}}
      {{% tab "Request Options" %}}

- **Time out**: Specify the amount of time in seconds before the test times out.
- **Ignore server certificate error**: Select to have your gRPC test go on with connection even if there are errors when validating the SSL certificate.
- **gRPC metadata**: Add and define metadata to your gRPC request to pass metadata between services.

      {{% /tab %}}
      {{% tab "Authentication" %}}

- **Client certificate**: Authenticate through mTLS by uploading your client certificate (`.crt`) and the associated private key (`.key`) in `PEM` format.

<br/>

You can use the `openssl` library to convert your certificates. For example, convert a `PKCS12` certificate to `PEM` formatted private keys and certificates.

```bash
   openssl pkcs12 -in <CERT>.p12 -out <CERT_KEY>.key -nodes -nocerts
   openssl pkcs12 -in <CERT>.p12 -out <CERT>.cert -nokeys
```

      {{% /tab %}}
      {{< /tabs >}}

   5. **Name** your gRPC test.

   6. Add Environment **Tags** as well as any other tags to your gRPC test. You can then use these tags to filter through your Synthetic tests on the [Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing page][4].

   7. Click **Invoke** to try out the request configuration. A response preview is displayed on the right side of your screen.

   8. Click **Create Test** to submit your API test.

### Define assertions

Assertions define what an expected test result is. After you click **Send**, an assertion on the `response time` is added based on the response that was obtained. You must define at least one assertion for your test to monitor.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Behavior Check" %}}

| Type | Operator | Value type |
|---|---|---|
| response time | `is less than` | _Integer (ms)_ |
| gRPC response | `contains`, `does not contain`, `is`, `is not`, <br> `matches`, `does not match`, <br> [`jsonpath`][1], [`xpath`][2] | _String_ <br> _[Regex][3]_ |
| gRPC metadata | `is`, `is not`, `contains`, `does not contain`, `matches regex`, `does not match regex`, `does not exist` | _Integer (ms)_ <br> _[Regex][3]_ |

You can create up to 20 assertions per API test by clicking **New Assertion** or by clicking directly on the response preview:

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/assertions_grpc_behavior_check_blur.png" alt="Define assertions for your gRPC test to succeed or fail on" style="width:90%;" >}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Health Check" %}}

| Type | Operator | Value type |
|---|---|---|
| response time | `is less than` | _Integer (ms)_ |
| healthcheck status | `is`, `is not` | _Integer (ms)_ |
| gRPC metadata | `is`, `is not`, `contains`, `does not contain`, `matches regex`, `does not match regex`, `does not exist` | _Integer (ms)_ |

You can create up to 20 assertions per API test by clicking **New Assertion** or by clicking directly on the response preview:

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/assertions_grpc_health_check.png" alt="Define assertions for your gRPC test to succeed or fail on" style="width:90%;" >}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

If a test does not contain an assertion on the response body, the body payload drops and returns an associated response time for the request within the timeout limit set by the Synthetics Worker.

If a test contains an assertion on the response body and the timeout limit is reached, an `Assertions on the body/response cannot be run beyond this limit` error appears.

### Select locations

Select the **Locations** to run your gRPC test from. gRPC tests can run from both managed and [private locations][2] depending on your preference for running the test from outside or inside your network.

{{% managed-locations %}}

### Specify test frequency

gRPC tests can run:

* **On a schedule** to ensure your most important services are always accessible to your users. Select the frequency at which you want Datadog to run your gRPC test.
* [**Within your CI/CD pipelines**][3] to start shipping without fearing faulty code might impact your customers experience.
* **On-demand** to run your tests whenever makes the most sense for your team.

### Use variables

You can use the [global variables defined on the **Settings** page][9] in the URL, advanced options, and assertions of your gRPC tests.

To display your list of variables, type `{{` in your desired field.

## Test failure

A test is considered `FAILED` if it does not satisfy one or more assertions or if the request prematurely failed. In some cases, the test can fail without testing the assertions against the endpoint.

These reasons include the following:

`gRPC specific errors`
: gRPC has a list of specific status codes that can be found in the [official gRPC documentation][10].

`CONNRESET`
: The connection was abruptly closed by the remote server. Possible causes include the web server encountering an error or crashing while responding, or losing connectivity to the web server.

`DNS`
: DNS entry not found for the test URL. Possible causes include a misconfigured test URL or the wrong configuration of your DNS entries.

`INVALID_REQUEST`
: The configuration of the test is invalid (for example, a typo in the URL).

`SSL`
: The SSL connection couldn't be performed. [See the dedicated error page for more information][11].

`TIMEOUT`
: The request couldn't be completed in a reasonable time. Two types of `TIMEOUT` can happen:
  - `TIMEOUT: The request couldn't be completed in a reasonable time.` indicates that the request duration hit the test defined timeout (default is set to 60 seconds).
  For each request, only the completed stages for the request are displayed in the network waterfall. For example, in the case of `Total response time` only being displayed, the timeout occurred during the DNS resolution.
  - `TIMEOUT: Overall test execution couldn't be completed in a reasonable time.` indicates that the test duration (request and assertions) hits the maximum duration of 60.5 seconds.

## Permissions

By default, only users with the [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][12] can create, edit, and delete Synthetic gRPC tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic gRPC tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][12].

If you are using the [custom role feature][13], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.
