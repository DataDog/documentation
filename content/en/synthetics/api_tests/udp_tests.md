## Overview

UDP tests allow you to easily monitor that low-level UDP connections can be established on the ports of given hosts, ensuring availability of any services living on UDP ports. With built-in response time data, you can keep track of the performance of your network applications and be alerted in case of unexpected slowness.

UDP tests can run from both [managed][1] and [private locations][2] depending on your preference for running the test from outside or inside your network.

## Configuration

After choosing to create an `UDP` Test, define your test's request.

### Define request

1. Specify the **Host** and **Port** to run your test on. By default, the port is set to `443`.
2. Enter the string you want to send in your test. 
3. Specify the amount of time in seconds before the test times out.
4. **Name** your UDP test.
5. Add `env` **Tags** as well as any other tag to your UDP test. You can then use these tags to quickly filter through your Synthetic tests on the [Synthetic Monitoring homepage][3].

(New UDP request screenshot and move all screenshots for Define request down here).

Click **Test URL** to try out the request configuration. A response preview is displayed on the right side of your screen. (Let's make this sentence uniform across all test type pages).

### Define assertions

Assertions define what an expected test result is. When you click **Test URL**, basic assertions on `response time`, `string response`, and `UDP connection` are added. You must define at least one assertion for your test to monitor.

| Type            | Operator       | Value Type                        |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| response time   | `is less than` | *Integer (ms)*                    |
| string response | `is`           | *String*                          |
| UDP connection  | `is`           | `established`, `timeout`, `refused` |

Select the response preview directly or click **New Assertion** to create an assertion. You can create up to 20 assertions per UDP test.

### Select locations

Select the **Locations** to run your UDP test from. UDP tests can run from both [managed][1] and [private locations][2] depending on your preference for running the test from outside or inside your network.

### Specify test frequency

UDP tests can run:

- **On a schedule** to ensure your most important services are always accessible to your users. Select the frequency with which you want Datadog to run your UDP test. (Remove this Specify test frequency screenshot)
- [**Within your CI/CD pipelines**][4].
- **On-demand** to run your tests whenever makes the most sense for your team.

### Define alert conditions

You can set alert conditions to determine the circumstances under which a test should fail and trigger an alert.

#### Fast retry

Your test can trigger retries in case of failed test result. Configuration is available to better suit your alerting sensibility.

Location uptime is computed on a per-evaluation basis (whether the last test result before evaluation was up or down). The total uptime is computed based on the configured alert conditions. Notifications sent are based on the total uptime.

#### Alerting rule

When you set the alert conditions to `An alert is triggered if your test fails for X minutes from any n of N locations`, an alert is triggered only if these two conditions are true:

* At least one location was in failure (at least one assertion failed) during the last *X* minutes;
* At one moment during the last *X* minutes, at least *n* locations were in failure.

### Notify your team

A notification is sent by your test based on the [alerting conditions](#define-alert-conditions) previously defined. Use this section to define how and what message to send to your teams.

(replace this monitor link everywhere)

1. [Similar to monitors][6], select **users and/or services** that should receive notifications either by adding an `@notification`to the message or by searching for team members and connected integrations with the drop-down box.

2. Enter the notification **message** for your test. This field allows standard [Markdown formatting][7] and supports the following [conditional variables][8]:

    | Conditional Variable       | Description                                                         |
    |----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `{{#is_alert}}`            | Show when the test alerts.                                          |
    | `{{^is_alert}}`            | Show unless the test alerts.                                        |
    | `{{#is_recovery}}`         | Show when the test recovers from alert.                             |
    | `{{^is_recovery}}`         | Show unless the test recovers from alert.                           |

3. Specify how often you want your test to **re-send the notification message** in case of test failure. To prevent renotification on failing tests, leave the option as `Never renotify if the monitor has not been resolved`.

Email notifications include the message defined in this section as well as a summary of failed assertions.
Notifications example:

Click **Save** to save and start your test.

## Variables

### Create local variables

To create a local variable, click **Create Local Variable** at the top right hand corner. You can define the value from one of the following available builtins:

`{{ numeric(n) }}`
: Generates a numeric string with `n` digits.

`{{ alphabetic(n) }}`
: Generates an alphabetic string with `n` letters.

`{{ alphanumeric(n) }}`
: Generates an alphanumeric string with `n` characters.

`{{ date(n unit, format) }}`
: Generates a date in one of our accepted formats with a value corresponding to the date the test is initiated at +/- `n` chosen unit.

`{{ timestamp(n, unit) }}` 
: Generates a timestamp in one of our accepted units with a value corresponding to the timestamp the test is initiated at +/- `n` chosen unit.

When you have entered a name and a value, click **Add Variable**. (standardize this sentence)

### Use variables

You can use the [global variables defined in `Settings`][9] and [locally defined variables](#create-local-variables) in the URL and assertions of your UDP tests.

To display your list of variables, type `{{` in your desired field:

## Test failure

A test is considered `FAILED` if it does not satisfy one or several assertions or if the request prematurely failed. In some cases, the test can indeed fail without being able to test the assertions against the endpoint. 

These reasons include the following:

`CONNRESET`
: The connection was abruptly closed by the remote server. Possible causes include the webserver encountering an error or crashing while responding, or loss of connectivity of the webserver.

`DNS`
: DNS entry not found for the test URL. Possible causes include misconfigured test URL or the wrong configuration of your DNS entries.

`INVALID_REQUEST` 
: The configuration of the test is invalid (for example, a typo in the URL).

`TIMEOUT`
: The request couldn't be completed in a reasonable time. Two types of `TIMEOUT` can happen:
  - `TIMEOUT: The request couldn’t be completed in a reasonable time.` indicates that the timeout happened at the TCP socket connection level.
  - `TIMEOUT: Retrieving the response couldn’t be completed in a reasonable time.` indicates that the timeout happened on the overall run (which includes TCP socket connection, data transfer, and assertions).

## Permissions

By default, only users with the Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles can create, edit, and delete Synthetic UDP tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic UDP tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][10].

If you have access to the [custom role feature][11], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.
