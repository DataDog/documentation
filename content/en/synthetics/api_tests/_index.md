## Overview

API tests help you **proactively monitor** your most important services so they are available anytime and from anywhere. 

Launch requests on the different network layers of your systems with these subtypes:

If your service starts answering slower or in an unexpected way (such as an unexpected response body or wrong A record), your test can [alert your team][1], [block your CI pipeline][2], and [roll back the faulty deployment][2].

API tests run from Datadog [managed locations][3] or [private locations][4], allowing **internal and external coverage** of your systems.

**Note:** API tests are single requests executed against your services. If you want to monitor sophisticated business transactions at the API level or endpoints that require authentication, chain your requests with [multistep API tests][5].
