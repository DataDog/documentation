## Overview

HTTP tests allow you to **send HTTP requests to your applications' API endpoints** in order to verify that they are responding to requests, as well as that they meet any conditions you define-such as overall response time, status code, and header or body content.

HTTP tests can be run from [**managed**][1] and [**private locations**][2] depending on whether you want to monitor your endpoints from outside or inside your network. HTTP tests can run **on a schedule**, **on-demand**, or directly **within your [CI/CD pipelines][3]**.

## Configuration

After choosing the type of test you want to create ([`HTTP`][4], [`SSL`][5], [`TCP`][6], [`DNS`][7], or [`ICMP` test][8]), you can define your test's request.

### Define request

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/http_test_config.png" alt="Define HTTP request" style="width:90%;" >}}

1. Choose the **HTTP Method** and specify the **URL** to query. Available methods are: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`. Both `http` and `https` URLs are supported.
2. Enrich your HTTP request with **Advanced Options** (optional):

  {{< tabs >}}

  {{% tab "Request Options" %}}

  * **Follow redirects**: Select to have your HTTP test follow up to ten redirects when performing the request.
  * **Request headers**: Define headers to add to your HTTP request. You can also override the default headers (for example, the `user-agent` header).
  * **Cookies**: Define cookies to add to your HTTP request. Set multiple cookies using the format `<COOKIE_NAME1>=<COOKIE_VALUE1>; <COOKIE_NAME2>=<COOKIE_VALUE2>`.
  * **HTTP Basic Auth**: Add HTTP basic authentication credentials.

  {{% /tab %}}

  {{% tab "Request Body" %}}

  * **Body type**: Select the type of the request body (`text/plain`, `application/json`, `text/xml`, `text/html`, or `None`) you want to add to your HTTP request.
  * **Request body**: Add the content of your HTTP request body. **Note**: The request body is limited to a maximum size of 50 kilobytes.

  {{% /tab %}}

  {{% tab "Certificate" %}}

  * **Ignore server certificate error**: Select to have your HTTP test go on with connection even if there are errors when validating the SSL certificate.
  * **Client certificate**: Authenticate through mTLS by uploading your client certificate (`.crt`) and the associated private key (`.key`) in `PEM` format. You can use the `openssl` library to convert your certificates. For example you can convert a `PKCS12` certificate to `PEM` formatted private keys and certificates.

  ```
  openssl pkcs12 -in <CERT>.p12 -out <CERT_KEY>.key -nodes -nocerts
  openssl pkcs12 -in <CERT>.p12 -out <CERT>.cert -nokeys
  ```

  {{% /tab %}}

  {{% tab "Proxy" %}}

  * **Proxy URL**: Specify the URL of the proxy the HTTP request should go through (`http://<YOUR_USER>:<YOUR_PWD>@<YOUR_IP>:<YOUR_PORT>`).
  * **Proxy Header**: Add headers to include in the HTTP request to the proxy.

  {{% /tab %}}
  
  {{% tab "Privacy" %}}

  * **Do not save response body**: Select this option to prevent response body from being saved at runtime. This can be helpful to ensure no sensitive data gets featured in your test results. Use mindfully as it can make failures troubleshooting more difficult. Read more about security recommendations [here][1].

3. **Name** your HTTP test.
4. Add `env` **Tags** as well as any other tag to your HTTP test. You can then use these tags to quickly filter through your Synthetic tests on the [Synthetic Monitoring homepage][9].
6. Select the **Locations** to run your HTTP test from: HTTP tests can run from [managed][1] and [private locations][2] depending on whether you are willing to monitor your endpoints from outside or inside your network.

Click on **Test URL** to try out the request configuration. You will see a response preview show up on the right side of your screen.

### Specify test frequency

HTTP tests can run:

* **On a schedule** to ensure your most important endpoints are always accessible to your users. Select the frequency you want Datadog to run your HTTP test.

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/schedule.png" alt="Run API tests on schedule"  style="width:90%;" >}}

* [**Within your CI/CD pipelines**][3] to start shipping without fearing faulty code might impact your customers experience.
* **On-demand** to run your tests whenever makes the most sense for your teams.

### Define assertions

Assertions define what an expected test result is. When hitting `Test URL` basic assertions on `response time`, `status code`, and `header` `content-type` are added based on the response that was obtained. You must define at least one assertion for your test to monitor.

| Type          | Operator                                                                                               | Value type                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| body          | `contains`, `does not contain`, `is`, `is not`, <br> `matches`, `does not match`, <br> [`jsonpath`][10] | _String_ <br> _[Regex][11]_ <br> _String_, _[Regex][11]_ |
| header        | `contains`, `does not contain`, `is`, `is not`, <br> `matches`, `does not match`                       | _String_ <br> _[Regex][11]                                      |
| response time | `is less than`                                                                                         | _Integer (ms)_                                                  |
| status code   | `is`, `is not`                                                                                         | _Integer_                                                      |

**Note**: HTTP tests can uncompress bodies with the following `content-encoding` headers: `br`, `deflate`, `gzip`, and `identity`.

You can create up to 20 assertions per API test by clicking on **New Assertion** or by clicking directly on the response preview:

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/assertions.png" alt="Define assertions for your HTTP test" style="width:90%;" >}}

### Define alert conditions

Set alert conditions to determine the circumstances under which you want a test to fail and trigger an alert.

#### Alerting rule

When you set the alert conditions to: `An alert is triggered if any assertion fails for X minutes from any n of N locations`, an alert is triggered only if these two conditions are true:

* At least one location was in failure (at least one assertion failed) during the last *X* minutes;
* At one moment during the last *X* minutes, at least *n* locations were in failure.

#### Fast retry

Your test can trigger retries in case of failed test result. By default, the retries are performed 300 ms after the first failed test result-this interval can be configured via the [API][12].

Location uptime is computed on a per-evaluation basis (whether the last test result before evaluation was up or down). The total uptime is computed based on the configured alert conditions. Notifications sent are based on the total uptime.

### Notify your team

A notification is sent by your test based on the [alerting conditions](#define-alert-conditions) previously defined. Use this section to define how and what message to send to your teams.

1. [Similar to monitors][13], select **users and/or services** that should receive notifications either by adding an `@notification`to the message or by searching for team members and connected integrations with the drop-down box.

2. Enter the notification **message** for your test. This field allows standard [Markdown formatting][14] and supports the following [conditional variables][15]:

    | Conditional Variable       | Description                                                         |
    |----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `{{#is_alert}}`            | Show when the test alerts.                                          |
    | `{{^is_alert}}`            | Show unless the test alerts.                                        |
    | `{{#is_recovery}}`         | Show when the test recovers from alert.                             |
    | `{{^is_recovery}}`         | Show unless the test recovers from alert.                           |

3. Specify how often you want your test to **re-send the notification message** in case of test failure. To prevent renotification on failing tests, leave the option as `Never renotify if the monitor has not been resolved`.

Email notifications include the message defined in this section as well as a summary of failed assertions.
Notifications example:

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/notifications-example.png" alt="API Test Notifications"  style="width:90%;" >}}

Click on **Save** to save your test and have Datadog start executing it.

## Variables

### Create local variables

You can create local variables by clicking on **Create Local Variable** at the top right hand corner of your test configuration form. You can define their values from one of the below available builtins:

`{{ numeric(n) }}`
: Generates a numeric string with `n` digits.

`{{ alphabetic(n) }}`
: Generates an alphabetic string with `n` letters.

`{{ alphanumeric(n) }}`
: Generates an alphanumeric string with `n` characters.

`{{ date(n, format) }}`
: Generates a date in one of our accepted formats with a value of the date the test is initiated + `n` days.

`{{ timestamp(n, unit) }}` 
: Generates a timestamp in one of our accepted units with a value of the timestamp the test is initiated at +/- `n` chosen unit.

### Use variables

You can use the [global variables defined in the `Settings`][16] and the [locally defined variables](#create-local-variables) in the URL, Advanced Options, and assertions of your HTTP tests.
To display your list of variables, type `{{` in your desired field:

{{< img src="synthetics/api_tests/use_variable.mp4" alt="Using Variables in API tests" video="true" width="90%" >}}

## Test failure

A test is considered `FAILED` if it does not satisfy one or several assertions or if the request prematurely failed. In some cases, the test can indeed fail without being able to test the assertions against the endpoint, these reasons include:



`CONNRESET`
: The connection was abruptly closed by the remote server. Possible causes include the webserver encountering an error or crashing while responding, or loss of connectivity of the webserver.

`DNS`
: DNS entry not found for the test URL. Possible causes include misconfigured test URL, wrong configuration of your DNS entries, etc.

`INVALID_REQUEST` 
: The configuration of the test is invalid (for example, a typo in the URL).

`SSL`
: The SSL connection couldn't be performed. [See the dedicated error page for more information][17].

`TIMEOUT`
: The request couldn't be completed in a reasonable time. Two types of `TIMEOUT` can happen:
  - `TIMEOUT: The request couldn’t be completed in a reasonable time.` indicates that the timeout happened at the TCP socket connection level. 
  - `TIMEOUT: Retrieving the response couldn’t be completed in a reasonable time.` indicates that the timeout happened on the overall run (which includes TCP socket connection, data transfer, and assertions).
