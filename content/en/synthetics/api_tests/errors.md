## SSL errors

SSL errors can occur during an API test run. They are different from failing assertions on SSL tests and can occur on all types of API tests.

| `INVALID_CA`                         | A CA certificate is not valid because it is not a CA or its extensions are not consistent with the intended purpose.                                                     |

| `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`          | A self-signed certificate exists in the certificate chain. The certificate chain can be built using the untrusted certificates, but the root CA cannot be found locally. |
| `UNABLE_TO_DECODE_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY` | The public key in the certificate cannot be read.                                                                                                                        |

| `UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CRL_SIGNATURE`    | The CRL signature cannot be decrypted. (The actual signature value cannot be determined.)                                                                                |
| `UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL`                  | The certificate revocation list (CRL) is not found.                                                                                                                      |
| `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT`          | Unable to find the certificate for one of the certificate authorities (CAs) in the signing hierarchy, and that CA is not trusted by the local application.               |
| `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`  | The issuer certificate of a locally found certificate is not found. This usually means that the list of trusted certificates is not complete.                            |
| `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`    | No signatures are verified because the certificate chain contains only one certificate, which is not self-signed, and the issuer is not trusted.                         |
