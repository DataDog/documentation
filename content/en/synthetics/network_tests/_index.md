## Overview

Network Path testing in Synthetic Monitoring provides end-to-end visibility into the routes synthetic tests take, helping you to identify where failures occur across applications, on-premises networks, and ISPs. It enables faster root cause analysis, proactive issue detection, and actionable alerts when network tests fail, while offering data to report on uptime and demonstrate the value of network reliability investments.

Running Network Path tests from managed locations lets you perform TCP, UDP, and ICMP checks on your application to visualize the network path packets take when executing queries from different global locations.
