## Overview

Network Path testing in Synthetic Monitoring gives you complete visibility into the routes your synthetic tests follow, enabling you to pinpoint where failures happen, whether in applications, on-premises networks, or with ISPs. This accelerates root cause analysis, enables proactive issue detection, and triggers actionable alerts when tests fail. It also provides uptime data to help you measure and communicate the value of your network reliability investments.

Running Network Path tests from managed locations lets you perform TCP, UDP, and ICMP checks on your application to visualize the Network Path packets follow when executing queries from different global locations.
