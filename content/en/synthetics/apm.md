## Overview

The APM integration with Synthetics allows you to go from a test run that potentially failed to the root cause of the issue by looking at the trace generated by that very test run.

Having network-related specifics (thanks to your test) as well as backend, infrastructure, and log information (thanks to your trace) allows you to access a new level of details about the way your application is behaving, as experienced by your user.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Your service is [traced on the APM side][1].
* Your service uses an HTTP server.
* Your HTTP server is using a library that supports distributed tracing.

Create a test that hits your traced HTTP server, and Datadog automatically links the trace generated by your server to the corresponding test result.

## Supported Libraries

The following Datadog tracing libraries are supported:

* [Python][2]
* [Go][3]
* [Java][4]
* [Ruby][5]
* [JavaScript][6]

### How are traces linked to tests?

Datadog uses the distributed tracing protocol and sets up the following HTTP headers:

* `x-datadog-trace-id`, generated from the Synthetics backend. Allows Datadog to link the trace with the test result.
* `x-datadog-parent-id: 0`
* `x-datadog-origin: synthetics`, to make sure the generated traces don't affect your APM quotas. See below.
* `x-datadog-sampling-priority: 1`, [to make sure that the Agent keeps the trace][7].

### How are APM quotas affected?

The `x-datadog-origin: synthetics` header specifies to the APM backend that the traces are Synthetics generated. The generated traces consequently do not impact your classical APM quotas.

### How long are traces retained?

These traces are retained [just like your classical APM traces][8].
