## Overview

You can use the Application Gateway component to represent and visualize application gateways from your Azure environment.

## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select accent and fill colors for the body of the component in 3D view.
- **Tier**: Select the service level tier for your application gateway.
- **Size**: Select the size of your application gateway. This option is only available for the Standard and WAF tiers.
- **Instances**: Enter the number of instances for high-availability scenarios. This option is only available for the Standard and WAF tiers.
- **Compute units**: Enter the measure of compute capacity consumed by your application gateway. This option is only available for the Standard V2 and WAF V2 tiers.
- **Persistent connections**: Enter the number of persistent connections to your application gateway. This option is only available for the Standard V2 and WAF V2 tiers.
- **Throughput (Mbps)**: Enter the throughput of your application gateway in megabits per second. This option is only available for the Standard V2 and WAF V2 tiers.
- **Data processed (GB)**: Enter the total volume of data processed per month by your application gateway in gigabytes.
- **Outbound data processed (GB)**: Enter the total volume of outbound data processed per month by your application gateway in gigabytes.

## API

Use [the Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects. The following is an example JSON object of an Application Gateway component:

### Schema

```

- **type: string**: The type of component. Must be a string of value `azureappgw` for this component.
- **id: string, uuid**: The unique identifier for the component. The API uses a UUID v4 internally but accepts any unique string.
- **resourceId: string**: The globally unique identifier for the component within Azure.
- **region: string**: The Azure region for the component. The API supports all global regions, except China.
- **mapPos: array**: The position of the component in the blueprint. The API uses a unique X and Y coordinate pair to express positioning.
- **tier: string**: The service level tier for the application gateway. Accepts one of four values, `Standard`, `Standard V2`, `WAF`, or `WAF V2`. Defaults to `Standard V2`.
- **size: string**: The size of the application gateway. Accepts one of three values, `Small`, `Medium`, or `Large`. Defaults to `Medium`.
- **instances: number**: The number of application gateway instances. Defaults to `2`.
- **computeUnits: number**: The measure of compute capacity consumed by the application gateway. Defaults to `0`.
- **persistentConnections: number**: The number of persistent connections to your application gateway. Defaults to `0`.
- **throughput: number**: The throughput of the application gateway in megabits per second. Defaults to `0`.
- **dataProcessed: number**: The total volume of monthly data processed by the application gateway in gigabytes. Defaults to `0`.
- **outboundDataTransfer: number**: The total volume of monthly outbound data processed by the application gateway in gigabytes. Defaults to `0`.
- **color: object**: The fill color for the component body.
  - **isometric: string**: A hexadecimal color for the component body in 3D view. Defaults to `#CEE0F5`.
  - **2d: string**: A hexadecimal color for the component body in 2D view. Defaults to `null`.
- **accentColor: object**: The accent color for the component logo.
  - **isometric: string**: A hexadecimal color for the component logo in 3D view. Defaults to `#0078D4`.
  - **2d: string**: A hexadecimal color for the component logo in 2D view. Defaults to `null`.
- **link: string, uri**: A URI that links the component to another diagram or an external website. Accepts one of two formats, `blueprint://` or `https://`.
- **locked: boolean**: Whether to allow changes to the position of the component through the web interface. Defaults to `false`.
