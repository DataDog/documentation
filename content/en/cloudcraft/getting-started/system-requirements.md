Our development team strives to make Cloudcraft more accessible, but for now, our application will work best with Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, like Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera.

For the ideal user experience we recommend using Google Chrome at this time. You may experience performance issues when using other browsers, such as Firefox and Safari.
