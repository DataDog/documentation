#### Create a client secret

Next, create a client secret to allow the Cloudcraft application to securely identify itself to Azure's authentication services.

**Note**: You can choose your own expiration period for the client secret. Be aware that when the secret expires, you wonâ€™t be able to scan your Azure account until you register a new secret and update the account in Cloudcraft.

1. On your application page in Azure, under the **Manage** section in the left sidebar, click **Certificates & secrets**.
2. In the **Certificates & secrets** section, **New client secret**.
3. Enter the following information:
    - **Description**: Cloudcraft
    - **Expires**: 730 days (24 months)
4. Click **Add**.
5. Copy the **Value** of your newly created secret.
6. In Cloudcraft, paste the client secret in the **Client secret** field and click **Next**.

#### Create an IAM user for Cloudcraft

Finally, create an IAM user to allow the Cloudcraft application to read your Azure environment.

1. In Cloudcraft, click **Open your Azure Subscriptions page** link to open the **Subscriptions** page in Azure.
2. Select the subscription you want to use with Cloudcraft.
3. On subscription page, select **Access control (IAM)** in the left sidebar.
4. Click **Add** and select **Add role assignment**.  A new page with a list of roles appears.
5. Select **Reader** and click **Next**.
6. On the next page, leave **User, group or service principal** selected and click **Select members**. Search for **Cloudcraft** and select it.
7. Click **Review + assign**.
8. In Cloudcraft, click **Next**.

#### Add subscriptions

Before saving the account, you can optionally configure team access.
