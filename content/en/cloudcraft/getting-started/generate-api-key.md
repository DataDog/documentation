Cloudcraft offers a developer API that provides programmatic access and remote rendering of your architecture diagrams. The API also provides fully automated visualization of AWS and Azure accounts that are linked with your Cloudcraft account, either as ready to use images or as JSON data.

Authentication is required to use this API. This guide describes how to create an API key through the web interface.

<div class="alert alert-info">The ability to use Cloudcraft's developer API is only available to Pro subscribers. Check out <a href="https://www.cloudcraft.co/pricing">Cloudcraft's pricing page</a> for more information.</div>

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have:

- A Cloudcraft user with the [Owner or Administrator role][1].
- An active [Cloudcraft Pro subscription][2].

## Create an API key

To create an API key for automation, navigate to **User** > **API keys** and click **Create API key**.

You'll want to give the API key a name that describes what it's for, for example, "Automation Key," and define the permissions you want to grant to the key. You may also share the key with a team.

When you're done, click **Save key** and a new API key will be created. Make sure to write down the key in a secure location so you can use it later.

If you have any questions or issues with this process, [contact Cloudcraft's support team][3].
