## Overview

Using Cloudcraft's Bits menu, you can seamlessly move from any resource within Cloudcraft to the most relevant views in Datadog. This feature enables quick access to relevant information tailored to the specific resource you're examining. Whether it's logs, APM traces, or other data in Datadog, accessing it from your Cloudcraft diagram is a click away.

<div class="alert alert-info">To access this feature, log into Cloudcraft using your Datadog account. If you are logging in using another login method, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/app/support">contact our support team</a> for assistance.</div>

## The Bits menu

Start by clicking on a [supported component](#supported-components) in your diagram. After you've selected a component, the Bits menu appears on the right-hand side of the screen.
