## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select a predefined color or enter the hexadecimal value of the color for the component and its accent. The component can use the same color for both the 2D and 3D view, or different colors for each.
- **Rotate**: Rotate the component and change its direction.
- **Connections**: View, remove, or add VPN connections to this gateway.

## API

Use the [Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects.

### Schema

The following is an example JSON of a VPN Gateway component:

```json
{
  "type": "vpngateway",
  "id": "1a4851fe-8357-4896-876b-f2d3040d108c",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "mapPos": [11.5,12],
  "color": {
    "isometric": "#000000",
    "2d": "#000000"
  },
  "accentColor": {
    "isometric": "#ffeb3b",
    "2d": "#ffeb3b"
  },
  "direction": "down",
  "link":" blueprint://58c2aeae-d5b7-4a50-83ea-b3fa9d17d3f5",
  "locked": true
}
```

- **type: vpngateway**: The type of component.

- **color: object**: The fill color for the component body.
  - **isometric: string**: The fill color for the component in the 3D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
  - **2d: string**: The fill color for the component in the 2D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
- **accentColor: obect**: The accent color used to display the component logo on the block.
  - **isometric: string**: The accent color for the component in the 3D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
  - **2d: string**: The accent color for the component in the 2D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
- **direction: string**: The rotation or direction of the component. Accepts `down` or `right`. Default is `down`.
- **link: uri**: Link the component to another diagram using the `blueprint://ID` format or to an external website using the `https://LINK` format.
