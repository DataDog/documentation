## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select a predefined color or enter the hexadecimal value of the color for the component and its accent. The component can use the same color for both the 2D and 3D view, or different colors for each.
- **Emails/month (K)**: Enter the number of email messages sent per month, in the thousands.

## API

Use the [Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects.
