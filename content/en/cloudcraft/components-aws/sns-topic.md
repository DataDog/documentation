## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select a fill color for the body of the component and an accent color for its symbol. You can use the same colors for the 2D and 3D views or different colors for each.
- **Requests / month (K)**: Enter the number of requests per month, in thousands.

## API

Use the [Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects.

### Schema

The following is an example JSON object of a SNS Topic component:

```
{
    "type": "snstopic",
    "id": "2bb4357c-7f18-45ba-9cde-37cc8f9717aa",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "mapPos": [6,9],
    "requests": 1,
    "color": {
        "isometric": "#ECECED",
        "2d": "#CC2264"
    },
    "accentColor": {
        "isometric": "#4286C5",
        "2d": "#FFFFFF"
    },
    "link": "https://aws.amazon.com/sns/",
    "locked": true
}
```

- **color: object**: The fill color for the component body.
  - **isometric: string**: A hexadecimal color for the component body in the 3D view. Defaults to `#ECECED`.

  - **2d: string**: A hexadecimal color for the component logo in the 2D view. Defaults to `#FFFFFF`.
