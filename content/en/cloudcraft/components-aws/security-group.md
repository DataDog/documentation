kind: documentation

## Overview

Use the Security Group component to represent security groups from your Amazon Web Services architecture.

{{< img src="cloudcraft/components-aws/security-group/component-security-group-diagram.png" alt="Screenshot of an isometric Cloudcraft diagram showing the 'Security group' AWS component." responsive="true" style="width:60%;">}}

## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select a predefined color or enter the hexadecimal value of the color for the component and its accent. The component can use the same color for both the 2D and 3D view, or different colors for each.
- **Name**: Give the security group a name.
- **Shape**: Select a shape for the security group, dynamic or rectangular.
- **Padding**: Increase or decrease the amount of space inside the security group.
- **Inbound/Outbound**: View, remove, or add inbound and outbound rules for components inside this security group.

## API

Use the [Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects.

### Schema

The following is an example JSON of a Security Group component:

```

- **type: sg**: The type of component.
- **id: string**: A unique identifier for the component in the `uuid` format.
- **region: string**: The AWS region the security group is deployed in. All global regions are supported except `cn-` regions.
- **name: string**: The name for the security group.
- **shape: string**: The shape of the security group. Accepted values are `dynamic` or `rectangular`.
- **padding: number**: The internal padding for the security group. Defaults to `1.5`.
- **nodes: array**: The components inside the security group. See [Accepted values for `nodes`](#accepted-values-for-nodes) for more information.
- **inboundRules: array**: The rules for incoming traffic for the components inside this security group. See [Accepted values for `inboundRules` and `outboundRules`](#accepted-values-for-inboundrules-and-outboundrules) for more information.
- **outboundRules: array**: The rules for outgoing traffic for the components inside this security group. See [Accepted values for `inboundRules` and `outboundRules`](#accepted-values-for-inboundrules-and-outboundrules) for more information.
- **color: object**: The fill color for the component.
  - **isometric: string**: The fill color for the component in the 3D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
  - **2d: string**: The fill color for the component in the 2D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
- **link: uri**: Link the component to another diagram using the `blueprint://ID` format or to an external website using the `https://LINK` format.
- **locked: boolean**: If `true`, changes made to the component using the application are disabled until unlocked.

### Accepted values for `nodes`

The `nodes` key accepts an array of unique identifiers for the components inside the security group.

The following AWS components can be added to a security group:

```
asg, ec2, lambda, efs, fsx, elb, rds, docdb, elasticache, redshift, es
```

In addition to the AWS components, the following common components can also be added to security groups:

```
block, isotext, icon, image, area
```

### Accepted values for `inboundRules` and `outboundRules`

The `inboundRules` and `outboundRules` keys accept an array with rules represented by JSON objects.

```json
{
  "inboundRules": [
    {
      "portRange": "22",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "target": "192.0.2.0/24",
      "targetType": "ip",
      "description": "RFC 5737",
      "hidden": false
    }
  ],
  "outboundRules": [
    {
      "portRange": "25",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "target": "199.255.192.0/22",
      "targetType": "ip",
      "description": "AWS SES",
      "hidden": false
    }
  ]
}

```

- **portRange: number**: The number of the port affected by this rule. Accepts a single port or a range of ports, for example, `42000-42222`.
- **protocol: string**: The network protocol affected by this rule.
- **target: string**: The CIDR or `id` of a security group that is the source of traffic to the components.
- **targetType: string**: The type of source used for `target`. Accepted values are `ip` or `sg`.
- **description: string**: A short description for the inbound or outbound rule.
- **hidden: boolean**: If `true`, the inbound or outbound rule is not displayed in the diagram. See the component image at the top of the page to see how it is displayed. Defaults to `false`.
