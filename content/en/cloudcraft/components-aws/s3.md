## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select a predefined color or enter the hexadecimal value of the color for the component and its accent. The component can use the same color for both the 2D and 3D view, or different colors for each.
- **Volume type**: The type of volume used for the S3 bucket.
- **Storage**: The amount of storage used in the bucket in gigabytes.
- **PUT/COPY/POST**: The number of monthly `PUT`, `COPY`, and `POST` requests to the S3 bucket, in the thousands.
- **GET and others**: The number of monthly `GET`, `SELECT`, and other requests to the S3 bucket, in the thousands.
- **Lifecycle Transition**: The number of monthly lifetime transition requests to the S3 bucket, in the thousands. Only available for S3 buckets with the Infrequent Access volume type.


## API

Use the [Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects.
