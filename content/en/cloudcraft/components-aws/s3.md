The **S3** component is used to represent S3 buckets from your Amazon Web Services architecture with Cloudcraft.

## Toolbar

The toolbar is displayed when selecting a component. It allows you to customize parts of your component and its visual to your liking.

- **Color**. Select a predefined color or enter the hexadecimal value of the color for the component and its accent. The component can use the same color for both 2D and 3D view, or different colors for each.
- **Volume type**. The type of volume used for the S3 bucket.
- **Storage**. Amount of storage used in the bucket in gigabytes.
- **PUT/COPY/POST**. Number of monthly requests of type PUT, COPY, or POST to the S3 bucket, in the thousands.
- **GET and others**. Number of monthly requests of type GET, SELECT, or others to the S3 bucket, in the thousands.
- **Lifecycle Transition**. Number of monthly lifetyme transition requests to the S3 bucket, in the thousands. Only available for S3 buckets with volume type Infrequent Access.
