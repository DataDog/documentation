## Overview

Use the Subnet component to represent subnets from your Amazon Web Services architecture.

## Toolbar

Use the toolbar to configure and customize the component. The following options are available:

- **Color**: Select a predefined color or enter the hexadecimal value of the color for the component and its accent. The component can use the same color for both the 2D and 3D view, or different colors for each.
- **Name**: Give the subnet a name.
- **Shape**: Select a shape for the subnet.
- **Padding**: Increase or decrease the amount of space inside the subnet.

## API

Use the [Cloudcraft API][1] to programmatically access and render your architecture diagrams as JSON objects. 

### Schema

The following is an example JSON object of a Subnet component:

```json
{
  "type": "subnet",
  "id": "838f6f30-9cdd-4c6b-9eb2-dd71b9c64047",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "name": "example-cloudcraft-sb",
  "shape": "dynamic",
  "padding": 1.5,
  "nodes": [
    "e99bad32-82f6-49a7-b145-11963a3d7775"
  ],
  "color": {
    "isometric": "#000000",
    "2d": "#000000"
  },
  "link": "blueprint://90fb6b0b-f66e-4196-8d16-d68921448fdb",
  "locked": true
}
```

- **type: subnet**: The type of component.
- **id: string**: A unique identifier for the component in the `uuid` format.
- **region: string**: The AWS region this subnet is deployed in. All global regions are supported except `cn-` regions.
- **name: string**: The name for the subnet.
- **shape: string**: The shape of the subnet. Accepted values are `dynamic` or `rectangular`.
- **padding: number**: The internal padding for the subnet. Defaults to `1.5`.
- **nodes: array**: The components inside the subnet. See [Accepted values for `nodes`](#accepted-values-for-nodes) for more information.
- **color: object**: The fill color for the component.
  - **isometric: string**: The fill color for the component in the 3D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
  - **2d: string**: The fill color for the component in the 2D view. Must be a hexadecimal color.
- **link: uri**: Link the component to another diagram using the `blueprint://ID` format or to an external website using the `https://LINK` format.
- **locked: boolean**: If `true`, changes made to the component using the application are disabled until unlocked.

### Accepted values for `nodes`

The `nodes` key accepts an array of unique identifiers for the components inside the subnet.

The following AWS components can be added inside a subnet:

```
asg, ec2, lambda, efs, fsx, elb, rds, docdb, elasticache, redshift, es, natgateway
```

In addition to the AWS components, the following common components can also be added inside a subnet:

```
block, isotext, icon, image, area
```
