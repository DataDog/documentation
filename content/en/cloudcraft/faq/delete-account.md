## Delete a free Cloudcraft account

1. Click the **User** icon in the upper-right corner of Cloudcraft and select **User settings** from the dropdown menu.
2. Click **Delete account** at the bottom of the page.
3. Confirm you want to _immediately_ delete your account by clicking the red **Delete** button.

## Delete a paid Cloudcraft account
