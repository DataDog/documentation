You can delete your Cloudcraft account from inside the Cloudcraft application or by contacting their support team.

When an account is deleted, Cloudcraft removes the account's data from its servers. Be sure to export a copy of your data before deleting your account.

## Delete a free Cloudcraft account

1. Click the **User** icon in the upper-right corner of Cloudcraft and select **User settings** from the dropdown menu.
2. Click **Delete account** at the bottom of the page.
3. Confirm you want to _immediately_ delete your account by clicking the red **Delete** button.
4. [Fill out this form][1] to ensure your data is removed from Datadog's servers as well.

If you do not see the **Delete account** option, you may have had a paid account in the past. Please [contact the Cloudcraft support team][2] to delete your account.
