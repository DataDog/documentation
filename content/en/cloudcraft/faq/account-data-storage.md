Cloudcraft stores data in the AWS us-east-1 (North Virginia) region for public cloud users, and in the AWS us-gov-west-1 (US West) region for GovCloud customers.

All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry best practices.

We also implement rigorous security processes that you can check on [our security page](https://www.cloudcraft.co/security) and [recently achieved our first SOC 2 Type I report](https://help.cloudcraft.co/article/46-soc2-report).

If you are interested in storing your data in Europe, please [reach out to our sales team for information](mailto:cloudcraft-sales@datadoghq.com).
