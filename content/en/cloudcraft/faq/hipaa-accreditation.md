title: Does Cloudcraft have HIPAA accreditation?
kind: guide
---

Cloudcraft does not currently have HIPAA accreditation, however, the Cloudcraft application, services, and your data are hosted on [HIPAA eligible services within AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/).

We are committed to keeping your data secure and your private information private, and in the normal operation of Cloudcraft and Cloudcraft Pro Live scanning, your data should not be accessible, as the application only retrieves metadata about your AWS services, not the data, code, or company assets that you store there.

Still, compliance requires limiting what you feed to the application and to AWS or cloud architecture relevancy; do not enter or save personal health information in your blueprints.

You can check out [our security page](https://www.cloudcraft.co/security) or [get in touch with our sales team](mailto:cloudcraft-sales@datadoghq.com) for more information.
