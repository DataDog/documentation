title: Does Cloudcraft have HIPAA accreditation?
---

Cloudcraft does not currently have HIPAA accreditation; however, the Cloudcraft application, services, and your data are hosted on [HIPAA eligible services in AWS][1].

Cloudcraft is committed to keeping your data secure and your information private. During the normal operation of Cloudcraft and Cloudcraft Pro Live scanning, your data is not accessible, as the application only retrieves metadata about your AWS services, not the data, code, or company assets that you store there.

As compliance requires limiting what you provide to the application and to AWS, you should not enter or save personal health information in your blueprints.

You can check out [our security page][2] or [get in touch with our sales team][3] for more information.
