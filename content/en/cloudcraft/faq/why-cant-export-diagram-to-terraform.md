title: Why can't I export diagrams as Terraform code anymore?
kind: guide

As the **Export to Terraform** feature relied on a third-party provider, which limited our ability to support and improve its capabilities, Cloudcraft decided to remove the ability to export diagrams to Terraform code.

We plan to bring this feature in-house at a later date, but there is no timeline commitment at this point.
