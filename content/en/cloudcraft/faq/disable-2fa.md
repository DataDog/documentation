Yes, we can. If you no longer have access to your device or your recovery code, please [send an email to our support team](mailto:support@cloudcraft.co) to begin the reset process.

For privacy and security reasons we need the following information as well:

- The last 4 digits of the credit card on file with us.
- The billing address for the credit card on account.
- The date and amount of the last charge from us.
