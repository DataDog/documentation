title: Will I lose my diagrams if I downgrade?
---

No, you will not lose access to your diagrams when downgrading your account to Cloudcraft's free tier. You can continue to access your diagrams so long as you do not close your account.

However, diagrams that use the **Infinite Grid** feature will become read-only and the **Live Information Feed** for any AWS imported resources will no longer update.
