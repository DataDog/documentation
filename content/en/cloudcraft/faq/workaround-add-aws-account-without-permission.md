---

Connecting your AWS account with Cloudcraft requires an AWS user with permissions to create IAM roles.

If you don't have the right permissions, ask your organization's administrator to create the role for you.

Head to **User** â†’ **AWS accounts** inside Cloudcraft and click **Add AWS account**.

The next screen will provide step-by-step instructions and a link that configures the read-only IAM role for you. Copy the link and provide it to your organization's administrator, so they can create the role for you.

Once the role is created, follow the instructions in the article below to add your AWS account to Cloudcraft, skipping the steps about adding the role.
