Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) with Azure AD as your identity provider allows you to simplify authentication and login access to Cloudcraft.

This article helps you set up SSO if your identity provider is Azure AD. For other identity providers, see the following articles:

- [Enable SSO With Okta][1]
- [Enable SSO With a Generic Identity Provider][2]

For more general information on using SSO with Cloudcraft, check out [Enable SSO in Your Account][3].

## Setting up SAML/SSO

1. In Cloudcraft, navigate to **User** > **Security & SSO**.
2. The details you need to create a new application with Azure can be found in the **Cloudcraft service provider details** section.

3. Log in to Azure as an administrator.
4. Click the hamburger menu on the upper-left corner of the screen and select **Azure Active Directory**.
5. In the **Manage** section on the left menu, click **Enterprise applications**.
6. Click **New application** and select **Non-gallery application**.
7. Enter **Cloudcraft** as the name of the application, then click **Add**.

Next, configure the SAML integration using the details provided by Cloudcraft. 

1. In the **Getting started** section, select **Set up single sign on**, then click **SAML**.
2. Under the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, click **Edit**.
3. Enter the details provided by Cloudcraft. The fields are mapped as follows, with the first value being the label in Azure AD, and the second being the label in the Cloudcraft dialog.
    - **Identifier**: Service Provider Entity ID
    - **Reply URL**: Assertion Consumer Service URL
    - **Sign on URL**: Leave this blank to allow identity provider-initiated SSO

7. Toggle the **SAML Single Sign-On is enabled** option.
8. Navigate back to the Azure portal.
