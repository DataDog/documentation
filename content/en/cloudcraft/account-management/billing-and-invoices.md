## View, print, and configure receipts

If you need to view or print receipts, you can click on the blue **Billing history** button. Here you will see your past payments, and have the option to download, or view them in your browser.

By clicking the **Receipt settings** link at the bottom of the screen, you can configure receipts to be emailed to you each month, or include additional billing information, like your company address, or VAT ID.

## Switch to annual payment

You can switch to paying your subscription annually at any time. Click on the blue **Change plan** button, and then toggle the switch from **Monthly** to **Annual**. Click the blue **Continue** button when you are done.
