title: Cancel your Cloudcraft Subscription
kind: documentation
---

Canceling your Cloudcraft subscription is super easy and can be done in a few clicks from inside the application.

Only the account owner can cancel a Cloudcraft subscription, which takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle. When you cancel your subscription, your account is downgraded to the free plan.

You won't lose access to the diagrams you created, but you'll lose access to a few features.

- _Infinite grid_ blueprints will switch to read-only mode.
- The _Live_ feature will no longer be available.
- AWS and Azure resources will no longer update.
- [The Bits menu][1] will stop working.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you're canceling within the 30-day money-back guarantee period, and prefer a refund, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/support" rel="help" title="Cloudcraft support">reach out to Cloudcraft's support team</a> instead.
</div>

1. Navigate to **User** > **Subscription Settings**.
2. Select **Cancel subscription**.
3. Optionally, provide feedback on what Cloudcraft can do to be a better fit for you in the future.
4. Select **Cancel my account**.

If you do not see the **Cancel subscription** option, you may have bought your subscription through our sales team or through the AWS Marketplace.

- If you bought your subscription through our sales team, it won't auto renew and will expire at the end of your billing cycle.
- If you bought your subscription through the AWS Marketplace, the cancellation process must be done by you through your AWS account. For more information, see [Cancel your product subscription][2] in the AWS Marketplace documentation page.

<div class="alert alert-danger">Canceling a subscription does not remove your data from Cloudcraft's servers. Instead, it changes your account to the free plan. If you wish to delete your account and all data from Cloudcraft's servers, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/support" rel="help" title="Cloudcraft support">contact the Cloudcraft support team</a>.
