title: Cancel your Cloudcraft subscription
kind: guide
---

We're sorry to see you go! Only the account owner can cancel a Cloudcraft subscription, and it takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle; you won't be charged again, and your account will be downgraded to our free plan.

You won't lose access to the diagrams you created. However, keep in mind that **Infinite Grid** blueprints will switch to read-only mode until you subscribe again or change them to the standard grid size, and AWS resources will no longer update.

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If you're canceling within our 30-day money-back guarantee period and prefer a refund, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/support" rel="help" title="Cloudcraft support">reach out to our support team</a> instead.</p>

Now that you know everything you need to know, head to **User â†’ Subscription settings** inside Cloudcraft and click **Cancel subscription**.

The next screen will ask for optional feedback so our engineering team can make Cloudcraft a better fit for you and others in the future.

Feel free to skip this form. Click **Cancel my account** to confirm your cancellation.

Thank you for giving Cloudcraft a try!

<section class="alert alert-danger">
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Canceling a subscription doesn't remove your data from our servers; it downgrades your account to our free plan. If you wish to delete your account and all data from our servers, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/support" rel="help" title="Cloudcraft support">contact our support team</a>; they will be happy to help.</p>
