title: Cancel your Cloudcraft Subscription
kind: documentation
---

Only the Account Owner can cancel a Cloudcraft subscription, which takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle. When you cancel your subscription, your account is downgraded to the free plan.

You won't lose access to the diagrams you created. However, **Infinite Grid** blueprints will switch to read-only mode until you subscribe again or change them to the standard grid size, and AWS resources will no longer update.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you're canceling within the 30-day money-back guarantee period and prefer a refund, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/support" rel="help" title="Cloudcraft support">reach out to Cloudcraft's support team</a> instead.
</div>

1. Navigate to **User** > **Subscription Settings**.
2. Click **Cancel subscription**.
3. Optionally, provide feedback on what Cloudcraft can do to be a better fit for you in the future.
4. Click **Cancel my account**.

<div class="alert alert-danger">Canceling a subscription doesn't remove your data from our servers; it downgrades your account to our free plan. If you wish to delete your account and all data from Cloudcraft's servers, <a href="https://app.cloudcraft.co/support" rel="help" title="Cloudcraft support">contact their support team</a>.
