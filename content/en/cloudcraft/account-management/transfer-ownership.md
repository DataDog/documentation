title: Transfer Account and Team Ownership
kind: documentation
---

When creating a team in your Cloudcraft account, you are automatically granted owner role permissions. As an owner of a team, you are the only user who can manage subscription information. This includes payment information, such as payment details and the number of users your organization's license supports.

In certain cases, a user account, team, or blueprint assets may need to be transferred to a different user. This article guides you through the transfer process.

## If you have account access

If you have access to your Cloudcraft account and team, and wish to initiate a transfer to another user,  contact Support while logged in to the application. This method automatically meets Cloudcraft's requirements for account identification and proof of ownership, and ensures that Cloudcraft complies with all applicable laws.

1. Log in to Cloudcraft as the account owner.
2. Click the **User** avatar in the upper-right corner of the application and select **Contact support**. 
3. In the popup that appears in the lower-right corner of the application, click **Ask**.
4. Select **Email**, and then **Next**.
5. Fill in **Subject**, and **Message** fields.
6. Press the **Submit your support request** button.

For a faster turn around, give us as much information as possible in the **Message** field.

- What is the email address of the new owner?
- Does he already have an account with us?
- Do you want to delete your credit card information, or does the new owner get to keep it in the account?

The new owner will need to have a Cloudcraft account before we can make the transfer. You may direct them to [our sign up page][1].

## If you do not have account access

If you need to transfer ownership to another user, but don't have access to the account, contact the [Support Team][2]. You must have the following information ready before contacting Support:

- Email of the previous account owner.
- Email of the new account owner.
- The last 4 digits of the credit card on file.
- The billing address for the credit card on account.
- The date and amount of the last charge.
