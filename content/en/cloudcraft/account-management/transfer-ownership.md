title: Transfer Account and Team Ownership
kind: documentation
---

When creating a team in your Cloudcraft account, you are automatically granted owner role permissions. As an owner of a team, you are the only user who can manage subscription information. This includes payment information, such as payment details and the number of users your organization's license supports.

In certain cases, a user account, team, or blueprint assets may need to be transferred to a different user. This article guides you through the transfer process.

## If you have account access

If you have access to your Cloudcraft account and team, and wish to initiate a transfer to another user, contact Support using the **Contact support** page in the application. This method automatically meets Cloudcraft's requirements for account identification and proof of ownership, and ensures that Cloudcraft complies with all applicable laws.

**Note**: The new owner must have a Cloudcraft account before the transfer can be completed.

1. Log in to Cloudcraft as the account owner.
2. Click the **User** avatar in the upper-right corner of the application and select **Contact support**. 
3. Click **Ask**.
4. Select **Email**, and then click **Next**.
5. Fill in the **Subject** and **Message** fields.
6. Click **Submit your support request**.

For a faster turnaround, provide as much information as possible in the **Message** field.

- What is the email address of the new owner?
- Does the new owner already have a Cloudcraft account?
- Do you want to delete your credit card information, or does the new owner get to keep it in the account?

## If you do not have account access

If you need to transfer ownership to another user, but don't have access to the account, contact the [Support Team][2]. You must have the following information ready before contacting Support:

- Email of the previous account owner.
- Email of the new account owner.
- The last 4 digits of the credit card on file.
- The billing address for the credit card on account.
- The date and amount of the last charge.
