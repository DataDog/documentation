title: Enable SSO with a generic identity provider
kind: guide
---

Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) in Cloudcraft allows you and your teammates to simplify authentication and log-in access to Cloudcraft.

This article will help you get set up if you do not have a specific guide for your identity provider. Please see the separate articles listed below if your identity provider is Azure AD or Okta.

- [Enable SSO With Azure AD][1]
- [Enable SSO With Okta][2]

For more general information on using SSO with Cloudcraft, check out [Enable SSO in Your Account][3].

## Setting up SAML/SSO

<section class="alert alert-info">
  <p>The SAML Enterprise SSO feature is only available for the Enterprise plan, and can only be configured by the Cloudcraft account Owner role.</p>
</section>

Head to **User → Security & SSO** inside Cloudcraft.

The details you need to create a new application with your identity provider can be found in the **Cloudcraft service provider details** section.

With this information in hand, head to your identity provider's website and log in as an administrator.

Follow their documentation to create a new application for SAML integration, and map their fields with ours.

For reference, the fields are usually mapped like this, with the first one being the label used by your identity provider and the second one being the label at Cloudcraft.

- Single sign on URL: Assertion Consumer Service URL
- Audience URI: Service Provider Entity ID
- Name ID: NameId Format

For the **Name ID** field the provider might offer you a dropdown with options, instead of an input field. If that is the case, select **emailAddress** or similar.

<section class="alert alert-info">
  <p>You can also include an app logo to make it easier for users to see which application they are signing in to. We have one that fit most provider's restrictions <a href="https://static.cloudcraft.co/images/cloudcraft-okta-logo.png" title="Cloudcraft Logo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_new">over here</a>.</p>
</section>

With the application is set up with your provider, you can configure it to allow access to all the relevant users within your organization. You can find instructions on how to do that within their documentation.

Now that we have everything set up with your provider, it is time to configure Cloudcraft.

Grab the metadata file generated by your provider — sometimes called federation XML —, head back to **Security & SSO** inside Cloudcraft and upload your config file into the blue dotted box.

Lastly, toggle the **SAML Single Sign-On is enabled** option. Once you have verified that the SSO login is working as expected, if you prefer to have your users access Cloudcraft only via your identity provider, enable the **Strict mode** option.

We suggest testing the integration before telling your team about it, just to ensure that everything works as expected.
