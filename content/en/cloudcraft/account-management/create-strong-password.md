title: Create a Strong Password and Protect Your Data
---

Creating and maintaining strong, unique passwords, is a fundamental part of keeping your data safe anywhere on the internet.

A unique and robust password helps you:

- Keep your data safe.
- Protect your cloud architecture.
- Prevent someone else from accessing your account.

Create your password using 32 characters or more, with any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Cloudcraft performs password strength detection and requires sufficient complexity to withstand at least 10^8 guesses. Your password must not appear on any leaked password list.

Cloudcraft also performs automatic throttling and temporary lockout of accounts at 10 guesses per hour.

## Best practices

1. Use a password manager such as [1Password][1] or [Bitwarden][2]. They make it much easier to create and use long, complex passwords that are unique for each website you use.
2. Subscribe to a breach notification service like [Have I Been Pwned][3] so you're notified if a service you use experiences a security breach.
3. [Use two-factor authentication (2FA)][4]. Cloudcraft offers 2FA protection as do most services that deal with sensitive informatio.
