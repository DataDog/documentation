Your user profile is where you can make updates to your personal information, such as your name and email address. You can also update your password or add a password to your account if you signed up to Cloudcraft using the **Sign in with Google** button.

## Update your name and email address

1. Navigate to **User** > **User Settings**.
2. Update your name and email address, then click **Update Name** or **Update Email**.

- If you are not using **Sign in with Google**, your login will change to reflect your new email address.
- If you are using **Sign in with Google**, the only thing that will change is the email shown in your invoices and where communications are sent to.

<div class="alert alert-info">For privacy and security purposes, your name and email address are checked against Cloudcraft's database when you submit a support request, so you will want to make sure they are correct and up-to-date.
</div>

## Add or change your password

1. Navigate to **User** > **User Settings**.
2. Click **Change Password**.
3. Enter both your current password and new password.
4. Click **Change Password**.


If you need to update your password — [choose a strong one][1] —, you can do so by clicking the blue **Change Password** button to the right of the **Login** section.

A window will open up and ask for your old and new password. Type both in and click the blue **Change Password** link at the bottom.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you signed up for a Cloudcraft account using the <strong>Sign in with Google</strong> option, the <strong>Change Password</strong> button is replaced with an <strong>Add Password</strong> button. After you click the button, a password reset request will be sent to your email email address.
</div>
