kind: guide
---

Your user profile is where you can make updates to your personal information, like your name and email address, but also where you can update your password or add a password to your account if you signed up to Cloudcraft using the **Sign in with Google** button.

To start, head to **User → User settings** inside Cloudcraft.

## Update your name and email address

You can update your name and email address by simply updating the fields in this page and then clicking the blue **Update Name** or **Update Email** button.

- If you are not using **Sign in with Google**, your login will change to reflect your new email address.
- If you are using **Sign in with Google**, the only thing that will change is the email shown in your invoices and where company communication is sent to.

## Add or change your password

If you need to update your password — [choose a strong one](https://help.cloudcraft.co/article/59-create-strong-password) —, you can do so by clicking the blue **Change Password** button to the right of the **Login** section.

A window will open up and ask for your old and new password. Type both in and click the blue **Change Password** link at the bottom.

By clicking it, you will receive a password reset request over email; just follow the link and you should be all set.</p>
