Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) with Okta as your identity provider allows you to simplify authentication and login access to Cloudcraft.

This article helps you set up SSO if your identity provider is Okta. For other identity providers, see the following articles:

- [Enable SSO With Azure AD][1]
- [Enable SSO With a Generic Identity Provider][2]

For general information on using SSO with Cloudcraft, check out [Enable SSO in Your Account][3].

## Setting Up SAML/SSO

1. In Cloudcraft, navigate to **User** > **Security & SSO**.
2. The details you need to create a new application with Okta can be found in the **Cloudcraft service provider details** section.

3. Log in to Okta as an administrator.
4. Click **Application**.
5. Click **Add Application**, then click **Create New App**.
6. Select **SAML 2.0** as the sign on method and click **Create**. 
7. Enter **Cloudcraft** as the name of the application and leave the remaining values as-is.
8. Click **Next**.

<div class="alert alert-info">If you prefer to use an app logo, you can use <a href="https://static.cloudcraft.co/images/cloudcraft-okta-logo.png" title="Cloudcraft Logo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_new">this logo</a> which adheres to Okta's size restrictions.
</div>

9. Next, configure the SAML integration using the details provided by Cloudcraft. The fields are mapped as follows, with the first one being the label in Okta, and the second one being the label at Cloudcraft.
    - **Single sign on URL**: Assertion Consumer Service URL
    - **Audience URI**: Service Provider Entity ID

11. Proceed to the next screen and select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app** to answer the question "Are you a customer or partner?".
12. Click **Finish**. Now that the application is set up in Okta, you can assign your users to it and once you're done, navigate to the **Sign On** tab.
