## Overview

Investigating an incident requires trial and error. Drawing from their experience, engineers familiar with a particular area know where to first look for potential problems. Using Watchdog Insights allows all engineers, including less experienced ones, to pay attention to the most important data and accelerate their incident investigations.

Throughout most of Datadog, Watchdog returns two types of insights:

- **Anomalies**: All the pre-calculated [Watchdog alerts][11] matching the active search query that Watchdog found by scanning your organization's data. Access the full list in the [Watchdog Alert explorer][12].
- **Outliers**: Calculated on the product data matching the active query, outliers surface tags that appear too frequently in some event types (for example, errors) or drive some continuous metrics upwards (for example, latency).

{{< img src="logs/explorer/watchdog_insights/insights-for-log-explorer.png" alt="The log explorer showing the Watchdog Insights banner with five log anomalies" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Explore insights

The Watchdog Insights carousel sits near the top of the following product pages:

- [Log explorer][1]
- APM:
    - [Trace Explorer][2]
    - [Service Page][3]
    - [Resource Page][4]
    - [Database Explorer][5]
    - [Profile Explorer][6]
- Infrastructure:
    - [Processes Explorer][7]
    - [Serverless Explorer][8]
    - [Kubernetes Explorer][9]
- [Real User Monitoring (RUM) Explorer][10]
- [Error Tracking issue side panel][13]

Expand the carousel for an overview. The highest priority insights (based on `Insight type`, `State`, `Status`, `Start time`, `Anomaly type`) appear on the left.

{{< img src="watchdog/log_explorer_watchdog_insights.png" alt="The Watchdog Insights carousel on the Logs Explorer, showing three anomalies: new error logs in the web-store service, a spike in error logs in the product-recommendation service, and another spike in error logs in the product-recommendation service" style="width:100%;">}}

Click **View all** to expand the panel. A side panel opens from the right, containing a vertical list of Watchdog Insights. Each entry shows a detailed view, with more information than the summary card.

Every outlier comes with embedded interactions and a side panel with troubleshooting information. Each Insight's interactions and side panel vary based on the Watchdog Insight type.

### Filter on Insight query

To refine your current view to match a Watchdog Insight, hover over the top right corner of an Insight summary card. Two icons appear. Click on the inverted triangle icon with the tooltip **Filter on Insight**. The page refreshes to show a list of entries corresponding to the insight.

{{< img src="watchdog/filter_on_insight.png" alt="Filtering the explorer on the insight context" style="width:70%;">}}

### Share an outlier

To share a given outlier, click on it in the insight panel to open the details side panel. Click the **Copy Link** button at the top of the details panel:

{{< img src="watchdog/share-outlier.png" alt="Outlier side panel showing how to copy the link" style="width:80%;">}}

The link to the outlier expires with the retention of the underlying data. For instance, if the logs used to build the outlier are retained for 15 days, the link to the outlier expires with the logs after 15 days.

### Error outliers

Error outliers display fields such as [faceted tags or attributes][1] containing characteristics of errors that match the current query. Statistically overrepresented `key:value` pairs among errors provide hints into the root causes of problems.

Typical examples of error outliers include `env:staging`, `docker_image:acme:3.1`, and `http.useragent_details.browser.family:curl`.

In the banner card view, you can see:

  * The field name
  * The proportion of errors and overall logs that the field contributes to

{{< img src="logs/explorer/watchdog_insights/error_outlier_s_card.png" alt="The error outlier card showing a red bar with 73.3% of total errors and a blue bar with 8.31% of total errors" style="width:50%;" >}}

In the full side panel view, you can see:

  * The timeseries of error logs that contain the field
  * Tags that are often associated with the error logs
  * A comprehensive list of [log patterns][2]

### Latency outliers

Latency outliers display fields such as tags that are associated with performance bottlenecks that match the current search query. `key:value` pairs with worse performance than the baseline can provide hints into the performance bottlenecks among a subset of APM spans.

Latency outliers are computed for the span duration.

In the banner card view, you can see:

* The field name
* The latency distribution for spans containing the tag and the baseline for the rest of the data
* A percentile of interest latency value for the outlier tag and the difference with the baseline for the rest of the data
