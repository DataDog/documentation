<div id="markdoc-content"><article><p>This test page explores everyday items that are green, yellow, or red -- which also happen to be the colors of the common traffic light. If this seems contrived and odd, that's only because test pages are often both of those things.</p><p>Your selections:</p><ul><li>The value of the <code>color</code> pref is &quot;green&quot;.</li><li>The value of the <code>item</code> pref is &quot;grass&quot;.</li></ul><div ><h2>Green</h2><p>Green is a color that is often associated with nature, growth, and renewal.</p><div ><h3>Grass</h3><p>Grass is a common plant found in many environments, from lawns and gardens to fields and meadows. It plays a crucial role in ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various animals, including insects, birds, and mammals.</p><p>Grass is also important for soil health, as its roots help prevent erosion and retain moisture. In human landscapes, grass is often used for aesthetic and recreational purposes, creating green spaces for relaxation and play. Its lush, green appearance is a symbol of vitality and natural beauty.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Emerald</h3><p>Emeralds are a type of precious gemstone known for their rich green color, which is caused by trace amounts of chromium and vanadium. They have been prized for their beauty and rarity for thousands of years, often associated with royalty and luxury.</p><p>Emeralds are typically found in countries like Colombia, Brazil, and Zambia. Despite their stunning appearance, emeralds are not as durable as some other gemstones, requiring careful handling and setting in jewelry. They are believed to symbolize rebirth, love, and prosperity.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Lime</h3><p>Limes are small, green citrus fruits known for their tart and tangy flavor. They are commonly used in cooking and beverages to add a refreshing zest to dishes and drinks.</p><p>Limes are rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants, making them a healthy addition to the diet. They are often used in marinades, dressings, and desserts, as well as in cocktails like margaritas and mojitos. The bright, acidic taste of limes can enhance the flavors of both sweet and savory dishes.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Frog</h3><p>Frogs are amphibians known for their distinctive jumping abilities and croaking sounds. They are found in a variety of habitats, including ponds, forests, and wetlands.</p><p>Frogs play an important role in the ecosystem by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for larger animals. They undergo a fascinating life cycle, starting as eggs, then developing into tadpoles, and finally maturing into adult frogs. Frogs are also indicators of environmental health, as they are sensitive to changes in their surroundings. Their diverse colors and patterns make them interesting subjects for study and observation.</p></div></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h2>Yellow</h2><p>Yellow is a bright and cheerful color that is often associated with happiness, energy, and warmth.</p><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Banana</h3><p>Bananas are a type of fruit. They're often eaten raw or used in baking.</p><p>Bananas are rich in essential nutrients such as potassium, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, making them a healthy snack option. They are also known for their convenient natural packaging, as their peel protects the fruit and makes it easy to carry and eat on the go.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Sunflower</h3><p>Sunflowers are a striking type of flower recognized for their large, bright yellow petals and tall stems.</p><p>They are often grown for their beauty and are a popular choice in gardens and floral arrangements. Sunflowers are also cultivated for their seeds, which are used to produce sunflower oil and as a nutritious snack.</p><p>The flower's ability to turn its head to follow the sun, a phenomenon known as heliotropism, adds to its charm and appeal.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Lemon</h3><p>Lemons are a versatile citrus fruit known for their tart and tangy flavor.</p><p>They are commonly used in cooking and baking to add a refreshing zest to dishes, as well as in beverages like lemonade and tea. Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C, which is important for immune function and skin health. In addition to their culinary uses, lemons are also valued for their cleaning and deodorizing properties, making them a staple in many households.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>School Bus</h3><p>School buses are a vital mode of transportation for students, providing a safe and reliable way to travel to and from school.</p><p>These distinctive yellow vehicles are designed with safety features such as flashing lights, stop signs, and reinforced sides to protect passengers. School buses play a crucial role in the education system by ensuring that students have access to education regardless of their location. They also help reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact by consolidating student transportation into fewer vehicles.</p></div></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h2>Red</h2><p>Red is a vibrant and intense color often associated with strong emotions such as love, passion, and anger.</p><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Ruby</h3><p>Rubies are precious gemstones renowned for their deep red color, which is caused by the presence of chromium. They are one of the four precious stones, alongside sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Rubies have been highly valued throughout history for their beauty and rarity, often symbolizing wealth, power, and passion.</p><p>They are commonly used in fine jewelry, including rings, necklaces, and earrings. The allure of rubies extends beyond their aesthetic appeal, as they are also believed to possess protective and healing properties in various cultures.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Apple</h3><p>Apples are a widely consumed fruit known for their crisp texture and sweet to tart flavor. They come in various varieties, including Granny Smith, Fuji, and Gala, each with its unique taste and color. Apples are often eaten raw as a healthy snack, but they are also versatile in cooking and baking, used in dishes such as pies, sauces, and salads.</p><p>Rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, apples contribute to a balanced diet and offer numerous health benefits. The saying &quot;an apple a day keeps the doctor away&quot; highlights their nutritional value.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Firetruck</h3><p>Firetrucks are specialized vehicles designed to transport firefighters and their equipment to emergency situations, such as fires, accidents, and natural disasters. They are equipped with various tools, including hoses, ladders, and water tanks, to help combat fires and perform rescues.</p><p>Firetrucks are often painted in bright red to ensure high visibility and are fitted with sirens and flashing lights to alert other drivers on the road. These vehicles play a crucial role in public safety, enabling quick and efficient responses to emergencies.</p></div><div class="markdoc__hidden"><h3>Stop Sign</h3><p>Stop signs are essential traffic control devices used to manage vehicle and pedestrian traffic at intersections and crossings.</p><p>Stop signs are typically octagonal in shape and feature a red background with white lettering that reads &quot;STOP.&quot; The purpose of a stop sign is to instruct drivers to come to a complete stop, ensuring that the intersection is clear and safe to proceed. Stop signs help prevent accidents and improve road safety by regulating the flow of traffic and providing clear instructions to drivers. Their standardized design makes them easily recognizable and effective in promoting orderly driving behavior.</p></div></div></article></div>
