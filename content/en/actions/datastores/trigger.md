    1. Choose if the rule will be triggered when a new entry is added, a value has changed, or an entry is deleted.
    1. Choose the workflow that will be triggered when the event occurs.

## Audit automation rules

### About audit logs

Changes you make to a datastore are evaluated by whether they match any of your configured automation rules. Each time a rule is evaluated, a log of that event is created. You can view these logs to help with troubleshooting. 

In the screenshot below, audit logs were created for automation rules run when new entries were added, entries were changed, and entries were deleted. Each run generates three logs: one for the rule match, one for the workflow beginning execution, and one for the workflow execution result.
