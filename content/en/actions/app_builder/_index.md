Datadog App Builder is a low-code application building platform. It streamlines the development of your internal tools with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface and built-in support for JavaScript. App Builder integrates with popular services such as AWS and GitHub, allowing you to leverage data and seamlessly connect with external APIs and data stores. By integrating with Datadog's existing capabilities, App Builder provides a centralized context that enables you to take preventive actions or respond to ongoing incidents, all from within the same view that you use for troubleshooting.

## Configure App Builder actions

Datadog App Builder provides an [Action Catalog][1] of hundreds of actions across multiple integrations. The Action Catalog and the connection credentials for each integration are shared with [Datadog Workflow Automation][2]. If there isn't an integration that accomplishes your task, you can use generic actions such as the HTTP requests and JavaScript functions to perform any task that your app requires.

## Start with blueprints

Datadog provides you with preconfigured flows in the form of out-of-the-box [blueprints][3] to help you [get started][5].

Below are a few examples of what App Builder apps can do:
- Identify the most likely causes of a regression given a text description of an incident and the most recent 150 commits to a repo.
- Monitor your PagerDuty service status to get complete context while working on incidents.
- Allow users to manage their EC2 instances directly from a dashboard.
- Allow users to explore and view the content of an S3 bucket.
- Use a PagerDuty integration to see who is on-call for each team in an organization.
- Summarize the progress of each PR in a given repo.

## Take action directly from dashboards

You can use your apps from the Apps page or [access them directly from within your dashboards][6]. Datadog Apps function as native dashboard integrations, allowing you to customize and take action on your data straight from your Dashboard.

### Apps created by Datadog

Apps created by Datadog are apps that are embedded in Integration dashboards. They work without having to build them; all you need to do is choose a connection.

For example, the [EC2 integration dashboard][7] offers an EC2 instance management app. When you load the dashboard, the app is populated with demo data:

{{< img src="/service_management/app_builder/ootb-app-ec2-demo-data.png" alt="EC2 app created by Datadog, populated with demo data" style="width:100%;" >}}

To use the app with your data, click **+ Connect Data**, then either create a new connection or select an existing one. After you save your selection, the app displays data from your connection.

You can change the selected connection by clicking **Change Connection** in the app.

## App Builder Overview dashboard

The App Builder Overview dashboard provides a high-level overview of your Datadog apps. To find the dashboard, go to your [Dashboard list][8] and search for `App Builder Overview`.

## App Builder Debug Console

The App Builder Debug Console provides a central place to view real-time logs, action executions, and errors. 

To access the Debug Console, go to [your apps list][9] and click the **Edit** {{< img src="icons/pencil.png" inline="true" style="width:14px;">}} icon for one of your apps. Click the **Expand** {{< img src="icons/panel-bottom-grow.png" inline="true" style="width:14px;">}} icon to see the entire Debug Console. Information inside the console includes:
- **Action Executions:** Track the success and failure of action executions with their associated inputs and outputs
- **Errors:** View logs for errors, warnings, and info messages
- **Logs:** View configuration errors for your actions, transformers, variables, and components
- **App State:** Access real-time application state changes
