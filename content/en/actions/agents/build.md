You can create a new agent from the [Agents][1] page. The page lists information about existing agents, including the following:
- Agent Name
- Description
- Author
- Creation date

On the Agents page, you can access and filter your apps. Hover over an agent for options to clone or delete it. You can also enable the **My agents** toggle to see only agents that you've created:

## Create an agent

### Build an agent from a blueprint

Blueprints are helpful starter agents that cover common use cases. They come loaded with instructions for the agent's behavior and helpful tools from the Action Catalog. Blueprints also showcase best practices for setting up agent functionality.

To build an agent from a blueprint:

1. Navigate to the [Agents][1] page. 
1. In **Agent Blueprints**, click the blueprint you want to use. 
    1. Alternatively, you can click **New Agent** and browse the full list of blueprints.
1. Click **Create From Blueprint**.
1. Your new agent will have pre-populated settings and tools. You can immediately start chatting with the agent or [further customize it][2]. 
1. Click the gear icon to close the agent's settings.

### Create a custom agent

To build an agent from scratch: 

1. Navigate to the [Agents][1] page. 
1. Click **New Agent**. 
1. [Customize your agent][2]. Changes are saved automatically.
