You can create a new agent from the [Agents][1] page. The page lists information about existing agents, including the following:
- Agent Name
- Description
- Author
- Creation date

On the Agents page, you can access and filter your apps. Hover over an agent for options to clone or delete it. You can also enable the **My agents** toggle to see only agents that you've created:

{{< img src="/actions/agents/agent-dashboard.png" alt="The Agents page, filtered to show only 'My agents'" style="width:100%;" >}}
