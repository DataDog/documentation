## Overview

You can build custom AI agents to act on your observability data and third-party integrations. Your agents can use any action from the [Action Catalog][1] to investigate problems, start remediation, or manage resources.

## Start with a template 

When building an agent, you can choose a template to get started. Templates come with pre-filled instructions and relevant tools. Templates are named after their main role, like Security Analyst, Log Analyzer, Incident Responder, or DevOps Assistant.
