## Overview

In the context of [testing within a CI/CD pipeline, also known as shift-left testing][1], the production environment is typically the last link in the chain. Your application is likely to go through several steps before reaching this stage.

{{< img src="continuous_testing/environments.png" alt="Continuous Testing can be used all along the development cycle, from the local development environment to staging to prod." width="100%" >}}

While [scheduled Synthetic tests focus primarily on publicly available production environments][2], Continuous Testing allows you to test your application in any or all environments it's deployed in throughout the development cycle.

## Testing in multiple environments

Continuous Testing can reuse the same scenario from scheduled tests used against the production environment to test publicly available pre-production environments.

Whether it's for a [blueâ€”green deployment][3], or a dedicated staging environment, Continuous Testing allows you to reroute an existing scenario to a different environment. For more information, see [Testing Multiple Environments][4].

## Testing while using proxies, firewalls, or VPNs

Continuous Testing can test your application in the early steps of the development cycle, including behind a private network protected by a proxy, firewall, or VPN.

It can run the same scenario from scheduled Synthetic tests against changes deployed in a local server running on your development environment (such as a dev laptop), or in a CI/CD pipeline where your application is deployed in an ephemeral environment that lasts the same amount of time as the CI/CD job, or in a private staging environment.

Continuous Testing provides a [testing tunnel][5] which allows the Synthetic managed location to reach private environments. For more information, see [Testing While Using Proxies, Firewalls, or VPNs][6].
