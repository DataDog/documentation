## Overview

[Continuous Testing][1] enables you to run [Synthetic Monitoring tests][2] within your CI/CD pipelines, automating software testing throughout your product's lifecycle. [Test Optimization][3] provides a test-first view into your CI health by displaying important metrics and results from your tests. 

You can use Test Optimization to view Continuous Testing test runs, giving you a unified overview of metrics and results from all your test frameworks, including Synthetic Monitoring, in one place.

## View Continuous Testing test runs in Test Optimization

1. Navigate to the [Test Runs][4] Explorer in Test Optimization.
2. Filter the **Test Framework** facet to **synthetics**:

Use this feature to search, filter, and analyze Continuous Testing test runs, combining both Test Optimization and Continuous Testing metadata in a single view.

For example:

- Use the **Flaky**, **New Flaky** and **Known Flaky** facets to identify flaky test runs.
- Use the **Synthetics Teams** facet to analyze test run status and performance by team.
- Use the **@test.name** column to export a list of test runs and their names.

Select a Continuous Testing test run in the Test Optimization Explorer to view detailed information about that test run:

This opens a side panel where you can:

- Use the **Overview** tab to troubleshoot a flaky test by viewing the first and last commit it flaked.
- Use the **History** tab to visualize past runs by status and branch.
- Use the **Performance** tab to track the mean, minimum, maximum, p95, and trends for test run durations over time.

## Viewing test runs
