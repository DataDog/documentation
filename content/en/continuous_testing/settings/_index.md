## Overview

You can access Continuous Testing settings on the [Synthetic Monitoring & Testing Settings page][1].

{{< img src="continuous_testing/settings/parallelization.png" alt="Set parallelization for your Continuous Testing tests on the Settings page" style="width:100%;">}}

By default, all your tests running in CI/CD pipelines run sequentially (one after the other). To change this behavior, set a [parallelization value](#set-parallelization) and save your selection.

## Parallelization

Parallel tests are tests that run simultaneously in your [continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines][4]. 

{{< img src="continuous_testing/parallelization_explained.png" alt="A diagram that explains the benefits of parallelization vs. sequential test runs" style="width:100%;">}}

This ensures you can:

* Reduce pipeline duration and ship new features faster
* Increase development confidence and speed of delivery
* Have complete test coverage and reduce the volume of production-breaking bugs from reaching your codebase

### Estimate parallelization

Click **Estimate Parallelization** to see how many tests Datadog recommends running in parallel based on your [Continuous Testing metrics][3]. 

{{< img src="continuous_testing/estimated_parallelization.png" alt="Completing the Estimate Parallelization wizard in Continuous Testing Settings" style="width:60%;">}}

After specifying the expected duration for testing in your CI pipeline and, optionally, the average number of tests per CI batch, the **Estimated Parallelization** section calculates the amount of parallelization you want to set:

$$\text"estimated parallelization" = {\text"average numbers of tests per CI batch" * \text"average test duration"} / \text"expected duration in your CI pipeline"$$

### Set parallelization

1. Under **Set your preferences**, select the **Parallelization** option. 
2. Customize the parallelization you need based on how many tests you want to run in parallel.
3. Click **Save Selection**.
4. Confirm your selection.

## Permissions

In order to customize the parallelization for Continuous Testing, you must have the `billing_edit` permission. 

Otherwise, the following error displays: `You're missing edit permission for Continuous Testing settings. You can run your tests with a parallelization of X (up to X tests running at the same time at a given point during your CI). To increase this value, reach out to your administrator admin.email@datadoghq.com`.

For more information, see [Datadog Role Permissions][2].
