## Overview

The [Continuous Testing Explorer][1] provides visibility into the CI/CD jobs executing your Continuous Testing tests. 

{{< img src="continuous_testing/explorer_ci_batches.png" alt="Continuous Testing Explorer" style="width:100%;">}}

You can accomplish the following actions:

* Investigate every CI/CD job execution to identify and troubleshoot failing test results
* Compare test results executed against various devices and browsers to pinpoint cross browser and device issues
* Keep track of the progress of your tests in CI/CD pipelines
* Identify flaky tests to fix

## Explore test batches

The Continuous Testing Explorer displays batches of tests run by [Continuous Testing and your CI/CD provider][2]. Every batch corresponds with a call to the Datadog API (through one of your [CI/CD integrations][2], the [datadog-ci][3] NPM package, or directly through the API endpoint) and triggers one or several test executions. 

1. Click on a batch to open a side panel containing batch CI/CD metadata and batch test results. 
2. Explore the test executions performed as part of the batch and pinpoint test failures. 
3. Click on a failing test result to see the detailed **Test Result** page and investigate the root cause of the issue.
