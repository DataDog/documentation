Database Monitoring provides deep visibility into your MySQL databases by exposing query metrics, query samples, explain plans, connection data, system metrics, and telemetry for the InnoDB storage engine.

The Agent collects telemetry directly from the database by logging in as a read-only user. Do the following setup to enable Database Monitoring with your MySQL database:

1. [Configure database parameters](#configure-mysql-settings)
1. [Grant the Agent access to the database](#grant-the-agent-access)
1. [Install the Agent](#install-the-agent)

## Before you begin

Supported MySQL versions
: 5.6, 5.7, or 8.0+

Supported Agent versions
: 7.36.1+

Performance impact
: The default Agent configuration for Database Monitoring is conservative, but you can adjust settings such as the collection interval and query sampling rate to better suit your needs. For most workloads, the Agent represents less than one percent of query execution time on the database and less than one percent of CPU. <br/><br/>
Database Monitoring runs as an integration on top of the base Agent ([see benchmarks][1]).

Proxies, load balancers, and connection poolers
: The Datadog Agent must connect directly to the host being monitored. For self-hosted databases, `127.0.0.1` or the socket is preferred. The Agent should not connect to the database through a proxy, load balancer, or connection pooler. If the Agent connects to different hosts while it is running (as in the case of failover, load balancing, and so on), the Agent calculates the difference in statistics between two hosts, producing inaccurate metrics.

Data security considerations
: See [Sensitive information][2] for information about what data the Agent collects from your databases and how to ensure it is secure.

## Configure MySQL settings

To collect query metrics, samples, and explain plans, enable the [MySQL Performance Schema][3] and configure the following [Performance Schema Options][4], either on the command line or in configuration files (for example, `mysql.conf`):

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "MySQL 5.6" %}}
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `performance_schema` | `ON` | Required. Enables the Performance Schema. |
| `max_digest_length` | `4096` | Required for collection of larger queries. If left at the default value then queries longer than `1024` characters will not be collected. |
| <code style="word-break:break-all;">`performance_schema_max_digest_length`</code> | `4096` | Must match `max_digest_length`. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current` | `ON` | Required. Enables monitoring of currently running queries. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current` | `ON` | Required. Enables the collection of wait events. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long` | `ON` | Recommended. Enables tracking of a larger number of recent queries across all threads. If enabled it increases the likelihood of capturing execution details from infrequent queries. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history` | `ON` | Optional. Enables tracking recent query history per thread. If enabled it increases the likelihood of capturing execution details from infrequent queries. |
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "MySQL ≥ 5.7" %}}
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `performance_schema` | `ON` | Required. Enables the Performance Schema. |
| `max_digest_length` | `4096` | Required for collection of larger queries. If left at the default value then queries longer than `1024` characters will not be collected. |
| <code style="word-break:break-all;">`performance_schema_max_digest_length`</code> | `4096` | Must match `max_digest_length`. |
| <code style="word-break:break-all;">`performance_schema_max_sql_text_length`</code> | `4096` | Must match `max_digest_length`. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-current` | `ON` | Required. Enables monitoring of currently running queries. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-waits-current` | `ON` | Required. Enables the collection of wait events. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history-long` | `ON` | Recommended. Enables tracking of a larger number of recent queries across all threads. If enabled it increases the likelihood of capturing execution details from infrequent queries. |
| `performance-schema-consumer-events-statements-history` | `ON` | Optional. Enables tracking recent query history per thread. If enabled it increases the likelihood of capturing execution details from infrequent queries. |
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


**Note**: A recommended practice is to allow the agent to enable the `performance-schema-consumer-*` settings dynamically at runtime, as part of granting the Agent access. See [Runtime setup consumers](#runtime-setup-consumers).

## Grant the Agent access

The Datadog Agent requires read-only access to the database in order to collect statistics and queries.

The following instructions grant the Agent permission to login from any host using `datadog@'%'`. You can restrict the `datadog` user to be allowed to login only from localhost by using `datadog@'localhost'`. See the [MySQL documentation][5] for more info.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "MySQL 5.6" %}}

Create the `datadog` user and grant basic permissions:

```sql
CREATE USER datadog@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO datadog@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO datadog@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO datadog@'%';
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "MySQL ≥ 5.7" %}}

Create the `datadog` user and grant basic permissions:

```sql
CREATE USER datadog@'%' IDENTIFIED by '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';
ALTER USER datadog@'%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO datadog@'%';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO datadog@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO datadog@'%';
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Create the following schema:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS datadog;
GRANT EXECUTE ON datadog.* to datadog@'%';
GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON datadog.* TO datadog@'%';
```

Create the `explain_statement` procedure to enable the Agent to collect explain plans:

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE datadog.explain_statement(IN query TEXT)
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    SET @explain := CONCAT('EXPLAIN FORMAT=json ', query);
    PREPARE stmt FROM @explain;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
```

Additionally, create this procedure **in every schema** from which you want to collect explain plans. Replace `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` with your database schema:

```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE <YOUR_SCHEMA>.explain_statement(IN query TEXT)
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    SET @explain := CONCAT('EXPLAIN FORMAT=json ', query);
    PREPARE stmt FROM @explain;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE <YOUR_SCHEMA>.explain_statement TO datadog@'%';
```

### Runtime setup consumers
Datadog recommends that you create the following procedure to give the Agent the ability to enable `performance_schema.events_*` consumers at runtime.

```SQL
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE datadog.enable_events_statements_consumers()
    SQL SECURITY DEFINER
BEGIN
    UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name LIKE 'events_statements_%';
    UPDATE performance_schema.setup_consumers SET enabled='YES' WHERE name = 'events_waits_current';
END $$
DELIMITER ;
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE datadog.enable_events_statements_consumers TO datadog@'%';
```

## Install the Agent

Installing the Datadog Agent also installs the MySQL check which is required for Database Monitoring on MySQL. If you haven't already installed the Agent for your MySQL database host, see the [Agent installation instructions][6].

To configure this check for an Agent running on a host:

Edit the `mysql.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your MySQL [metrics](#metric-collection) and [logs](#log-collection-optional). See the [sample mysql.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options, including those for custom metrics.

### Metric collection

Add this configuration block to your `mysql.d/conf.yaml` to collect MySQL metrics:

```yaml
init_config:

instances:
  - dbm: true
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3306
    username: datadog
    password: '<YOUR_CHOSEN_PASSWORD>' # from the CREATE USER step earlier
```

**Note**: Wrap your password in single quotes in case a special character is present.

Note that the `datadog` user should be set up in the MySQL integration configuration as `host: 127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`. Alternatively, you may also use `sock`.

[Restart the Agent][9] to start sending MySQL metrics to Datadog.

### Log collection (optional)

In addition to telemetry collected from the database by the Agent, you can also choose to send your database logs directly to Datadog.

1. By default MySQL logs everything in `/var/log/syslog` which requires root access to read. To make the logs more accessible, follow these steps:

   1. Edit `/etc/mysql/conf.d/mysqld_safe_syslog.cnf` and comment out all lines.
   2. Edit `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` to enable the desired logging settings. For example, to enable general, error, and slow query logs, use the following configuration:

     ```conf
       [mysqld_safe]
       log_error = /var/log/mysql/mysql_error.log

       [mysqld]
       general_log = on
       general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
       log_error = /var/log/mysql/mysql_error.log
       slow_query_log = on
       slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql_slow.log
       long_query_time = 3
     ```

   3. Save the file and restart MySQL.
   4. Make sure the Agent has read access to the `/var/log/mysql` directory and all of the files within. Double-check your `logrotate` configuration to make sure these files are taken into account and that the permissions are correctly set.
      In `/etc/logrotate.d/mysql-server` there should be something similar to:

     ```text
       /var/log/mysql.log /var/log/mysql/mysql.log /var/log/mysql/mysql_slow.log {
               daily
               rotate 7
               missingok
               create 644 mysql adm
               Compress
       }
     ```

2. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent, enable it in your `datadog.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   logs_enabled: true
   ```

3. Add this configuration block to your `mysql.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your MySQL logs:

   ```yaml
   logs:
     - type: file
       path: "<ERROR_LOG_FILE_PATH>"
       source: mysql
       service: "<SERVICE_NAME>"

     - type: file
       path: "<SLOW_QUERY_LOG_FILE_PATH>"
       source: mysql
       service: "<SERVICE_NAME>"
       log_processing_rules:
         - type: multi_line
           name: new_slow_query_log_entry
           pattern: "# Time:"
           # If mysqld was started with `--log-short-format`, use:
           # pattern: "# Query_time:"
           # If using mysql version <5.7, use the following rules instead:
           # - type: multi_line
           #   name: new_slow_query_log_entry
           #   pattern: "# Time|# User@Host"
           # - type: exclude_at_match
           #   name: exclude_timestamp_only_line
           #   pattern: "# Time:"

     - type: file
       path: "<GENERAL_LOG_FILE_PATH>"
       source: mysql
       service: "<SERVICE_NAME>"
       # For multiline logs, if they start by the date with the format yyyy-mm-dd uncomment the following processing rule
       # log_processing_rules:
       #   - type: multi_line
       #     name: new_log_start_with_date
       #     pattern: \d{4}\-(0?[1-9]|1[012])\-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
       # If the logs start with a date with the format yymmdd but include a timestamp with each new second, rather than with each log, uncomment the following processing rule
       # log_processing_rules:
       #   - type: multi_line
       #     name: new_logs_do_not_always_start_with_timestamp
       #     pattern: \t\t\s*\d+\s+|\d{6}\s+\d{,2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\t\s*\d+\s+
   ```

4. [Restart the Agent][9].

## Validate
