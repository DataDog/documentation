Database Monitoring provides deep visibility into your Oracle databases by exposing query samples to profile your different workloads and diagnose issues.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
Before completing the steps below, verify that you have met <a href="/database_monitoring/setup_oracle/?tab=linux#prerequisites">the prerequisites</a> for Database Monitoring.
</div>

## Setup

Complete the following steps to enable Database Monitoring:

Configure the Agent for each RAC node by following the instructions for [self-hosted Oracle databases][7].

You must configure the Agent for each Real Application Cluster (RAC) node, because the Agent collects information from every node separately by querying `V$` views. The Agent doesn't query any `GV$` views to avoid generating interconnect traffic. The collected data from each RAC node is aggregated in the frontend.

```yaml
init_config:
instances:
  - server: '<RAC_NODE_1>:<PORT>'
    service_name: "<CDB_SERVICE_NAME>" # The Oracle CDB service name
    username: 'c##datadog'
    password: '<PASSWORD>'
    dbm: true
    tags:  # Optional
      - rac_cluster:<CLUSTER_NAME>
      - 'service:<CUSTOM_SERVICE>'
      - 'env:<CUSTOM_ENV>'
  - server: '<RAC_NODE_2>:<PORT>'
    service_name: "<CDB_SERVICE_NAME>" # The Oracle CDB service name
    username: 'c##datadog'
    password: '<PASSWORD>'
    dbm: true
    tags:  # Optional
      - rac_cluster:<CLUSTER_NAME>
      - 'service:<CUSTOM_SERVICE>'
      - 'env:<CUSTOM_ENV>'
```

The Agent connects only to CDB. It queries the information about PDBs while connected to CDB. Don't create connections to individual PDBs.

Set the `rac_cluster` configuration parameter to the name of your RAC cluster or some user friendly alias. The `rac_cluster` filter helps you select all RAC nodes in the [DBM Oracle Database Overview dashboard][8]. You can set an additional filter for the database of interest.

### Validate

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `oracle-dbm` under the **Checks** section. Navigate to the [Databases][6] page in Datadog to get started.

## Custom queries

Database Monitoring supports custom queries for Oracle databases. See the [conf.yaml.example][11] to learn more about the configuration options available.

<div class="alert alert-warning">Running custom queries may result in additional costs or fees assessed by Oracle.</div>
