Database Monitoring provides deep visibility into your Oracle databases by exposing query samples to profile your different workloads and diagnose issues.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
Before completing the steps below, verify that you have met <a href="/database_monitoring/setup_oracle/?tab=linux#prerequisites">the prerequisites</a> for Database Monitoring.
</div>

## Setup

Complete the following steps to enable Database Monitoring with your database:

### Multi-node Exadata

Configure the Agent for each node by following the instructions for [Oracle RAC][8].

### Single-node Exadata

Configure the Agent by following the instructions for [self-hosted Oracle databases][7].

### Validate

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `oracle-dbm` under the **Checks** section. Navigate to the [Databases][6] page in Datadog to get started.

## Custom queries

Database Monitoring supports custom queries for Oracle databases. See the [conf.yaml.example][11] to learn more about the configuration options available.

<div class="alert alert-warning">Running custom queries may result in additional costs or fees assessed by Oracle.</div>
