## Overview

### Goal
Detect Account Take Over (ATO) through brute force attempts

### Strategy
To determine a successful attempt: Detect a high amount of failed logins and at least one successful login for a given user. This will generate a `HIGH` severity signal.
To determine an attempt: Detect a high amount of failed logins. This will generate an `INFO` severity signal.

### Triage & Response
1. Inspect the logs to see if this was a valid login attempt.
2. See if 2FA was authenticated.
3. If the user was compromised, rotate user credentials.
