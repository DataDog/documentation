## Overview

Datadog Security Monitoring unifies the developers, operations, and security teams into one platform. A single dashboard displays devops content, business metrics, and security content.

Datadog detects threats out-of-the-box and can notify your team of security issues by email, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, or a webhook.

Datadog detects many different sorts of threats to your application or infrastructure. A few examples include a targeted attack, an IP communicating with your systems which matches a threat intel list, or an insecure configuration. These threats are surfaced in Datadog as Security Signals and can be correlated and triaged in the [Security Explorer][1].

Security Signals are generated by Datadog Security Monitoring with [Detection Rules][2]. Detection Rules detect threats across different sources and are available out of the box for immediate use. Any of the provided detection rules can be cloned to change the configuration. A [new rule][3] can also be created from scratch.
