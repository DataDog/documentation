The Datadog Partner Network provides many resources for partners. This is a guide to training for Sales Engineers, Solution Architects, Technical Account Managers and anyone who is involved in the technical aspects of Datadog sales at an MSP partner organization.

Should you have any questions during your journey, contact your PSM. Your PSM is your partner through the Datadog journey. There are many resources they can guide you to and many questions they can answer.

## Get Started with Datadog Partner Network (DPN)

If your organization is new to DPN, familiarize yourself with the DPN program and the Partner Portal. If it has already been upgraded to Basic Tier or above, proceed to [Datadog basics][5].

If you haven't already, register for the DPN program through the [Partner Portal][4]. Once registered, log in and click **Asset Library** to find and download the DPN Program Guide.

Follow instructions to register for the Basic Tier and begin training.

## Technical demo

Once you have completed the Datadog Sales Certification and are familiar with the Datadog basics, you should get your Demo Certification.

This hands-on video course teaches you to: 
- deliver a technical demo of core Datadog products
- understand how three pillars of observability are unified into a single pane of glass with Datadog
- create an engaging story as you walk the customer through the features
- get your head around how Datadog features come together

Once you go through the video modules that comprise the datadog demo, you are invited to submit a video recording, to be reviewed by your PSM. Look in your email inbox for results. Don't worry if you don't succeed on the first try. You can access your feedback and try again. Once you receive a confirmation that you passed, follow included instructions to schedule a virtual meeting with a Partner Solution Architect for you to deliver live demonstration and receive coaching. 

At the end of this process you receive your Datadog Demo Certification and are ready to engage a customer.

## Proof of value

To prepare for working with the customer to develop an initial proof of value solution, you need to obtain the Datadog Technical Certification. 

{{<img src="partners/sales-enablement/portal_tech_go.png" alt="DPN Technical Certification" style="max-width:367px">}}

This course:
- Explains the basics behind Datadog core products
- Addresses the market positioning of each product
- Describes customer success 
- Helps you position individual product offerings

If your organization is new to Datadog, this is the right time to develop your service offering. The Technical certification course prepares you for developing the service offering and it should be completed at this stage. Reach out to your PSM to get and validate ideas.

If the service offering already exists, review it at this stage to put your new Datadog knowledge in the context of your organization's market positioning.

### Deeper technical knowledge

Before you can begin a successful proof of value engagement, you need to deepen the technical knowledge you have acquired. Get started with the [Datadog Fundamentals Learning Path][1] offered by the Datadog Learning Center. The Learning Center courses include hands-on labs and deepen your technical understanding of how Datadog works.

The courses in the Datadog Fundamentals Learning Path give you:
- hands-on experience configuring datadog
- prepare to handle customer questions
- understanding of the moving pieces within Datadog
- ability to develop an initial solution for your customer

## Pricing

In order to complete your quote, you need to learn the Datadog pricing basics.

- [Datadog's pricing][2] describes how pricing works, including the units of measurement and the metering approach at Datadog.
- [Customer plans][3] provides details about standard end-customer pricing options.
- Finally, to understand discounts offered, check out the Partner Portal[4] pricing tab.

Once you go through the recommended training outlined above, you're ready 
to lead a customer to an effective observability solution and close the sale for your organization.

Remember to loop in your PSM to provide additional help as you engage with the opportunity and to register the deal at the Partner Portal[4].
