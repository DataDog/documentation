This article explains how to set up an environment to make the most of the Datadog API. At the end, you will be able to pull or push events, metrics, and monitors from [Datadog's public API][1] to a local file.

Prerequisite: Python and `pip` installed on your localhost. If you are on Windows, see the [Python documentation][2].

1. Open a terminal.
2. Verify the directory: `pwd` on macOS, `dir` on Windows.
3. Create a new folder: `mkdir <NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER>`.
4. Enter the folder: `cd <NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER>`.
5. Download the script [api_query_data.py][3] to the folder created in step 3 and edit it:

    a. Replace `<YOUR_DD_API_KEY>` and `<YOUR_DD_APP_KEY>` with your [Datadog API and app keys][4].

    b. Replace `system.cpu.idle` with a metric you want to fetch. A list of your metrics is displayed in the [Datadog Metric Summary page][5].

    c. Optionally, replace `*` with a host to filter the data. A list of your hosts is displayed in the [Datadog Infrastructure List page][6].

    d. Optionally, change the time period to collect the data. The current setting is 3600 seconds (one hour). **Note**: If you run this too aggressively, you may hit the [Datadog API limits][7].

    e. Save your file and confirm its location.

Once the above is complete:

1. It is best practice to create a virtual environment to install Python packages into. One virtual environment manager is [virtualenv][8].
2. Create a new virtual environment in the directory you created earlier by running `virtualenv venv`.
3. Activate the environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) or `> \path\to\env\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
4. Run `pip install datadog` to install the [Datadog API package][9]. This enables the Python file to interact with the Datadog API.
5. In the terminal, run the script: `python api_query_data.py`.

If successful, you will see data in the terminal and a file created in your folder named `out.txt`.

To see additional examples, see our [API documentation][1].
