You can use the [Webhooks integration][1] to trigger webhooks from Datadog monitors and events—this is often useful for having your Datadog account communicate with your team using custom communication tools, or even [forwarding monitor alerts to text messages][2].

You can also set up webhook notifications to call on [Datadog's API][3] if, for example, you wanted to submit a metric or event to your Datadog account every time a monitor triggered.

## How do to this

Each webhook must be set up with a name (to be referenced in monitors) and a URL (to be pinged by the webhook). For submitting a call to the Datadog API, select "Use custom payload" and add your custom payload to the subsequent field.

* The **name field**: whatever you like, as long as it is unique among all the other webhook name fields.

* The **url field**: the URL used when pinging the API. It looks like this:
`https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/<API_ENDPOINT>?api_key=<DATADOG_API_KEY>`

* The **custom payload field**: contains the JSON with all the options you want to include in the API call. The type of API call determines the appropriate options. You can sometimes use the monitor's `$symbol` content to fill in parts of the option values.

## Example

Imagine that you have a series of monitors that someone on your team would like to see a running momentary count of. They want this count in terms of how many of these monitors are in an OK vs. a CRITICAL status. You can add a webhook notification to submit a "check_run" API call whenever one of these monitors goes into an alert or OK state; from there you can add a "check status" widget in a [screenboard][4] to show your teammate what the status of all these monitors were at any given moment.

In that case, you need two separate webhooks, one for "mymonitorgroup-alert-check" and the other for "mymonitorgroup-ok-check". Both use the same API endpoint, so their respective name and URL values are be as follows:

* Name: mymonitorgroup-alert-check
    URL: `https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/check_run?api_key=<DATADOG_API_KEY>`

* Name: mymonitorgroup-ok-check
    URL: `https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/check_run?api_key=<DATADOG_API_KEY>`

The custom payload is where the name and tags of the check_run are applied. For the "alert" webhook, consider the following:

```json
{
  "check": "mymonitorgroup.status",
  "status": 2,
  "host_name": "$HOSTNAME",
  "tags": "[monitor:$ALERT_TITLE]"
}
```

With this custom payload, every time the @webhook-mymonitorgroup-alert-check is triggered by a monitor, it submits a check run named "mymonitorgroup.status" with a CRITICAL state, tagged by the monitor's name and, if applicable, the name of the host that the monitor is triggered on.

You can then apply the same custom payload values for the "mymonitorgroup-ok-check" check, but with a "status" of "0" instead of "2" to indicate an "OK" state.

With both of those webhooks set, you can go to your monitors (the ones your teammate wants a quick status view of) and add the webhook notification references, nested in their appropriate conditional logic tag, like so:

```text
{{#is_alert}} @webhook-mymonitorgroup-alert-check {{/is_alert}}
{{#is_recovery}} @webhook-mymonitorgroup-ok-check {{/is_recovery}}
```

Once your monitors are set and alerting (they'll all need to alert at least once in either OK or CRITICAL state in order to be included in the complete status count), you can then set up a "check status" widget in a [screenboard][4] over your "mymonitorgroup.check"—grouped out by, in this case, the "monitor" tag.

Here's an example of one such widget (although in this example, the check's name was "composite.status" and only one monitor in our group has yet triggered as "alert" and then "ok" again):
