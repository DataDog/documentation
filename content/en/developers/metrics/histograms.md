## Overview

Histograms measure the statistical distribution of a set of values.

Datadog histogram and timing metrics are essentially the same thing and are extensions on the [StatsD timing metric][1]: they aggregate the values that are sent during the flush interval (usually defaults to 10 seconds). 

If you send 20 values for a metric `<METRIC_NAME>` during the flush interval, a Datadog histogram gives you the aggregation of those values for the flush interval, i.e.:

* `<METRIC_NAME>.avg`: gives you the avg of those 20 values during the flush interval
* `<METRIC_NAME>.count`: gives you the count of the values (20 in this case) sent during the flush interval.
* `<METRIC_NAME>.median`: gives you the median of those values in the flush interval.
* `<METRIC_NAME>.95percentile`: gives you the 95th percentile value in the flush interval.
* `<METRIC_NAME>.max`: gives you the max value sent during the flush interval.
* `<METRIC_NAME>.min`: gives you the min value sent during the flush interval.
* `<METRIC_NAME>.sum`: gives you the sum of values sent during the flush interval.

Configure which aggregation you want to send to Datadog with the `histogram_aggregates` parameter in your [datadog.yaml configuration file][2]. 
By default only `max`, `median`, `avg`, and `count` aggregations are sent out to Datadog.
