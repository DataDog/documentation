title: Community Office Hours
type: documentation
---

Datadog runs twice monthly code reviews and office hours to assist community members who are contributing to Datadog [open source projects](#list-of-open-source-projects).

### Where

Office hours will be held in #integrations in the [Datadog Community Slack][1] ([get an invitation][2]), in conjunction with a [Zoom videoconference][3].

### When

* 2nd Wednesday of each month at 10:00 AM Eastern Time (New York).
* 4th Wednesday of each month at 3:00 PM Eastern Time (New York).

### Guidelines and caveats

- Review and feedback during office hours is offered on a first come, first served basis. We may not get to every review each week. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

- We welcome everyone from the community to join us and provide respectful and constructive feedback to their fellow members of the Datadog community.

- These sessions are not intended as a channel for general Datadog support. We are primarily focused on discussing and reviewing `datadog-agent` integrations, and contributions to other Datadog [open source projects](#list-of-open-source-projects). For product support we encourage you to reach out to [our support team directly][4].

- Sometimes a given PR may be complex and require further offline review before we can provide feedback.
