### Dashboards backup

Using Datadog [APIs][4], it's possible to write a script to backup your Dashboard definitions as code. See the following projects as examples of how these backups can be accomplished:

| Language   | Library          | Author          |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| JavaScript | [dog-watcher][5] | [Brightcove][6] |
| Ruby       | [doggy][7]       | [Shopify][8]    |
| Ruby       | [kennel][9]      | [Zendesk][10]    |

### Managing monitors
