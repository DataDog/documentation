Using Datadog [APIs][3], it's possible to write a script to backup your Dashboard definitions as code. See the following projects as examples of how these backups can be accomplished:

| Language   | Library          | Author          |
| ---        | ---              | ---             |
| JavaScript | [dog-watcher][4] | [Brightcove][5] |
| Ruby       | [doggy][6]       | [Shopify][7]    |
| Ruby       | [kennel][8]      | [Zendesk][9]    |
