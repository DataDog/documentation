## Overview

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) integrates with Datadog to accelerate your development.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/vscode/datadog-vscode.png" alt="The Datadog for VS Code extension" style="width:100%;" >}}

The **Code Insights** view keeps you informed about:
- Issues from [Error Tracking][10]
- [Vulnerability][11] reports by Application Security Management
- [Flaky tests][12] detected by CI Visibility
- Profiling insights from [Watchdog Insights][13]

The **Synthetic Tests** feature allows you to:
- Run Synthetic tests on your local environments
- Set custom parameters without altering the original test definition
- See test results locally in VS Code and in Datadog to access additional information
- Test only what matters by executing relevant tests at the same time
- Create a list of most frequently used Synthetic tests by linking them to your workspace

The **View in VS Code** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files. 

## Requirements

- **A Datadog account**: The extension requires a Datadog account. If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][2] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.

## Setup

Install the [Datadog Extension][6] from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Code Insights
The **Code Insights** tree displays insights generated by the Datadog platform that are relevant to your code-base. The insights are grouped into three categories: performance, reliability, and security.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/vscode/code-insights.png" alt="The Code Insights view." style="width:100%;" >}}

Code Insights include a detailed description for each issue, and links to:
- The related source code location
- The Datadog platform for additional information

You can dismiss individual insights and set filters to view the categories of insights that you are most interested to see.

## Synthetic Tests
The Datadog extension enables you to [run Synthetic HTTP tests and browser tests on local environments][1] directly in the IDE. You can identify and address potential issues resulting from code changes before they are deployed into production and impact your end users.

### Run Synthetic tests locally

1. Select a Synthetic test to execute. You can search for specific tests by clicking the **Search** icon.
2. Change the test's configuration to convert the start URL and specify a `localhost` URL on the **Settings** page.
3. Run the test.

{{< img src="developers/ide_integrations/vscode/test_configuration_modified_starturl.png" alt="The Test Configuration panel and Settings page where you can specify the start URL of a Synthetics test to a localhost URL" style="width:100%;" >}}

If you haven't set up Synthetic tests already, [create a test in Datadog][3]. For more information about running tests on a local environment, see [Getting Started with API Tests][4], [Getting Started with Browser Tests][5], and the [Continuous Testing Tunnel documentation][1].

### Permissions

By default, only users with the [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][7] can create, edit, and delete Synthetic HTTP and browser tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic HTTP and browser tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][7].

If you are using the [custom role feature][8], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.

## View in VS Code

The **View in VS Code** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed in the UI (for example, in [Error Tracking][10]):

<div class="alert alert-info">To use this feature, first configure <a href="/integrations/guide/source-code-integration/">source code integration</a> for your service.</div>
