## Overview

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio Code helps you improve your code reliability by allowing you to [run Synthetic HTTP tests and browser tests on local environments][1] directly in the IDE. The extension ensures that any potential issue resulting from code changes is identified and addressed before the code is deployed into production and impacts your end users.

You can use the Datadog extension to:

- Run Synthetic tests on your local environments.
- Set custom parameters without altering the original test definition.
- See test results locally in Visual Studio Code and in Datadog to access additional information.
- Test only what matters by executing relevant tests at the same time.
- Create a list of most frequently used Synthetic tests by adding them to **Favorites**. 

## Requirements

- **A Datadog account**: The extension requires a Datadog account. If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][2] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.
- **Synthetic tests**: The extension allows you to execute Synthetic tests. If you haven't set up Synthetic tests already, [create a test in Datadog][3]. For more information about running tests on a local environment, see [Getting Started with API Tests][4], [Getting Started with Browser Tests][5], and the [Continuous Testing Tunnel documentation][1].

## Setup

Install the [Datadog Extension][6] from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Run Synthetic tests locally

1. After installing the Datadog extension, log in to Datadog.
2. Select a Synthetic test to execute. You can search for specific tests by clicking the **Search** icon.
3. To run a test in a local environment, update a Synthetic test's configuration by enabling the conversion of the start URL and specifying a `localhost` URL on the **Settings** page.
4. Run a test.

## Permissions

By default, only users with the [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][7] can create, edit, and delete Synthetic HTTP and browser tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic HTTP and browser tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][7].

If you are using the [custom role feature][8], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.
