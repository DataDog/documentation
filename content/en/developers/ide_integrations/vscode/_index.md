  The Datadog extension for VS Code is in public beta. It is intended for all developers that use Datadog products, and especially those using <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/#pagetitle">Synthetic tests</a>. If the extension stops working unexpectedly, check for extension updates or <a href=#feedback>reach out to the team</a>.

## Overview

The Datadog extension for VS Code integrates with the Datadog platform to accelerate your development.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/vscode/datadog-vscode.png" alt="The Datadog for VS Code extension" style="width:100%;" >}}

The **Code Insights** view keeps you informed about:
- Issues from [Error Tracking][10]
- [Vulnerability][11] reports by Application Security Management
- [Flaky tests][12] detected by CI Visibility
- Profiling insights from [Watchdog Insights][13]

The **Synthetic Tests** feature allows you to:
- Run Synthetic tests on your local environments
- Set custom parameters without altering the original test definition
- See test results locally in VS Code and in Datadog to access additional information
- Test only what matters by executing relevant tests at the same time
- Create a list of most frequently used Synthetic tests by adding them to **Favorites** 

## Requirements

- **A Datadog account**: The extension requires a Datadog account. If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][2] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.
- **Synthetic tests**: The extension allows you to execute Synthetic tests. If you haven't set up Synthetic tests already, [create a test in Datadog][3]. For more information about running tests on a local environment, see [Getting Started with API Tests][4], [Getting Started with Browser Tests][5], and the [Continuous Testing Tunnel documentation][1].

## Setup

Install the [Datadog Extension][6] from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Code Insights
The **Code Insights** tree displays insights generated by the Datadog platform that are relevant to your code-base. The insights are grouped into three categories: performance, reliability, and security.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/vscode/code-insights.png" alt="The Code Insights view." style="width:100%;" >}}

Code Insights include a detailed description for each issue, and links to:
- The related source code location
- The Datadog platform for additional information

You can dismiss individual insights and set filters to view the categories of insights that you are most interested to see.

## Synthetic Tests
The Datadog extension enables you to [run Synthetic HTTP tests and browser tests on local environments][1] directly in the IDE. This ensures that any potential issue resulting from code changes is identified and addressed before the code is deployed into production and impacts your end users.

### Run Synthetic tests locally

1. Select a Synthetic test to execute. You can search for specific tests by clicking the **Search** icon.
2. To run a test in a local environment, update a Synthetic test's configuration by enabling the conversion of the start URL and specifying a `localhost` URL on the **Settings** page.
3. Run a test.

### Permissions

By default, only users with the [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][7] can create, edit, and delete Synthetic HTTP and browser tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic HTTP and browser tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][7].

If you are using the [custom role feature][8], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.

## View in VS Code

The **View in VS Code** feature provides a link from the Datadog platform directly to your source files. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed on the platform (for example, in [Error Tracking][10]):

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/vscode/view-in-vscode.png" alt="A stack trace on the Datadog platform showing the View in VS Code button." style="width:100%;" >}}

<div class="alert alert-info">A prerequisite for this feature is that Source Code Integration is configured for your service.</div>
