## Overview

Datadog extension for Visual Studio helps you find and fix bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues based on real-time observability data from your services and runtime environments.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/visual_studio/datadog-for-visual-studio.png" alt="Datadog extension for Visual Studio" style="width:100%;" >}}

The **Code Insights** view keeps you informed about:

- Issues from [Error Tracking][5]
- [Vulnerability][6] reports from Application Security Management
- Profiling insights from [Watchdog Insights][7]

The **Continuous Profiler** helps you reduce latency and lower cloud costs by highlighting code lines that:

- Consume the most CPU
- Allocate the most memory
- Spend the most time on locks, disk I/O, and socket I/O

The **View in Visual Studio** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio requires:

- Windows 10 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- Visual Studio 2022 Community, Professional, or Enterprise edition (64-bit)
- **Datadog account**: The extension requires a Datadog account. If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][3] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.
- **Continuous Profiler**: To display profiling data and insights, the extension requires the Continuous Profiler to be configured for your services. For more information, see [Getting Started with the Continuous Profiler][2].

### Download and install the extension

1. In Visual Studio, go to **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.
2. Search for `Datadog`.
3. Click **Download**.
4. Restart Visual Studio.

Alternatively, you can download the extension from the official [Visual Studio Marketplace][4]

### Sign in with your Datadog account

1. In Visual Studio, go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Datadog**.
2. Click **Sign In**.
3. In the browser window that opens, select your site and organization and authorize access to the platform.

### Link services

1. Open a .NET solution file with Visual Studio.
2. Go to **Extensions** > **Datadog** > **Linked Services**.
3. Click **Add Service**.
4. Select the services that are related to your .NET solution.
5. Save the .NET solution file.

## Code Insights

The **Code Insights** window displays insights generated by Datadog that are relevant to your current project. The insights are grouped into three categories: performance, reliability, and security.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/visual_studio/code-insights.png" alt="The Code Insights view" style="width:60%;" >}}

Code Insights include a detailed description for each issue, with links to:

- The related source code location
- The Datadog platform for additional information

You can dismiss individual insights that you do not want to see in the list.

## Continuous Profiler

The **Continuous Profiler** editor shows the Top Functions (the most resource-intensive methods) for a service in a selected environment, aggregated over a specific time frame.

You can specify the following parameters for the profiling data:
- The profile type to be displayed
- The environment in which the service is running
- The time frame for the profile samples to be aggregated

The available profiling types usually include options like **CPU Time** and **Allocated Memory**, but are determined by the platform and vary by language.

<div class="alert alert-info">To use this feature, first <a href="/profiler/enabling/dotnet/?tab=linux#enabling-the-profiler">enable profiling</a> for your service.</div>

### Top functions

The **Top Functions** view shows the methods that consume the most resources based on the aggregated profile data loaded from the Datadog servers.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_integrations/visual_studio/top-list.png" alt="The Top-list view" style="width:100%;" >}}

Double-clicking an item in the list (or selecting **Go To Source** from the context menu) opens a source code editor showing where the method is defined.

#### Call tree

The call tree to the right of the **Top Functions** shows the paths that lead to (and from) the selected method. Right-click on a method in the call tree to navigate to the source editor.

The default **Caller Hierarchy** view shows the callers (or predecessors) of the target method and the frequency with which they appear in the call stack. To view the callees (or successors), click the **Callee Hierarchy** button on the toolbar.

## View in Visual Studio

<div class="alert alert-info">To use this feature, first configure <a href="/integrations/guide/source-code-integration/">source code integration</a> for your service.</div>

The **View in Visual Studio** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed in the UI -- for example, in [Error Tracking][5]:
