## Overview

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio helps you find and fix bugs, security issues, and performance bottlenecks based on real-time observability data from your services and runtime environments.

### Code insights

Stay informed about [Error Tracking][5] issues, [Security Vulnerabilities][6], and [Flaky Tests][10] without leaving Visual Studio.

### Continuous Profiler

Analyze and improve the performance of your applications with real-time profiling metrics for CPU, Memory, I/O, and others.

### Logs navigation

You can navigate to the [Log Explorer][18] on the Datadog platform directly from your C# source files. Look for the clickable icon preceding message strings from log statements within your source code:

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/visual_studio/logs-navigation.png" alt="A source file showing log lines with clickable icons." style="width:100%;" >}}

Clicking the icon opens the **Log Explorer** with a query that matches the logger name, log level, and log message as closely as possible.

### Open code in Visual Studio from Datadog

Navigate from Datadog to your source code with one click.

### Static Analysis

The Datadog extension runs [Static Analysis][19] rules on the source files you have open in your Solution. The goal is to detect and fix problems such as maintainability issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in your code before you commit your changes.

Static Analysis supports scanning for many programming languages. For a complete list, see [Static Analysis Rules][20]. For file types belonging to supported languages, rule violations are highlighted in the source code editor, and suggested fixes can be applied directly:

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/visual_studio/static-analysis-issue.png" alt="A static analysis rule violation." style="width:100%;" >}}

When you start editing a source file supported by Static Analysis, the extension checks for `static-analysis.datadog.yml` at your source repository's root. The static analyzer runs automatically in the background.

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Windows operating system 64-bit

2. In Visual Studio, go to **Tools > Options > Datadog**.
3. Sign in with your Datadog account, or [sign up for a free trial][14].
4. Open a solution in Visual Studio.
5. Go to **Extensions > Datadog > Linked Services**.
6. Add services, and save your solution.
7. Go to **Extensions > Datadog > Code Insights**.

## Feedback

Report a bug, request a new feature, or ask for help on the [Discussion Forum][15] and [Issue Tracker][16] on GitHub. You can also email `team-ide-integration@datadoghq.com`.

## Data and Telemetry
Datadog anonymously collects information about your usage of this IDE, including how you interact with it, whether errors occurred while using it, and what caused those errors, in accordance with the [Datadog Privacy Policy][21] and [Datadog's EULA][22].

If you don't wish to send this data to Datadog, you can opt out at any time in the settings: `Options > Datadog > General > Data Sharing` and disable the `Send usage statistics` option.
