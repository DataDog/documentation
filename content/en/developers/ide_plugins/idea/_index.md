## Overview

The Datadog plugin for JetBrains IDEs helps improve software performance by providing code insights in the IDE based on real-time observability data. The plugin is for developers that use Datadog products including [Error Tracking][6], [Logs][23], [Live Debugger][21], [Code Security][24], [Test Optimization][18] and [CI Visibility][19] to monitor their services. It is available for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, PyCharm, WebStorm, and PhpStorm.

## Core Features

### Error Tracking
The [**Error Tracking**][6] integration helps you find and fix runtime errors from Error Tracking.

### Logs

The [Logs][23] integration detects log lines in your source code, displays live event counts directly in the source editor, and provides links to the Datadog Log Explorer to view the logs generated by each log line. 

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/idea/logs/logs.png" alt="Log events from Datadog" style="width:100%;" >}}

Find out more in the [Logs][23] sub-section.

### Live Debugger

The [**Live Debugger**][20] enables you to add logpoints—auto-expiring, non-breaking breakpoints—to your runtime code to collect information for debugging.

Find out more in the [Live Debugger][20] sub-section.

### Code Security
The [**Code Security**][24] integration promotes better security by:

- flagging library vulnerabilities and runtime code vulnerabilities as Code Insights
- checking your code locally, as you edit it, to detect quality and security issues before they are committed

Find out more in the [Code Security][24] sub-section.

## Other Features

### Code Insights
The **Code Insights** tab displays insights generated by the Datadog platform that are relevant to your current project. The insights are grouped into three categories: performance, reliability, and security.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/idea/code-insights-2.png" alt="The Code Insights tab." style="width:100%;" >}}

Code Insights include a detailed description for each issue, and links to:
- The related source code location
- The Datadog platform for additional information

You can dismiss individual insights and set filters to view the categories of insights that you are interested in.

### View in IDE

The **View in IDE** feature provides a link from the Datadog platform directly to the source files in your IDE. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed on the platform (for example, in [Error Tracking][6]):

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/idea/view-in-idea.png" alt="A stack trace on the Datadog platform showing the View in IntelliJ button." style="width:100%;" >}}

<div class="alert alert-info">A prerequisite to make the most of this feature is that Source Code Integration is configured for your service.</div>

### CI Test Runs
You can view recent test runs in the [CI Visibility Explorer][12] by navigating directly from your source files. Look for the **CI Test Run** inlays above test method declarations in your source code:

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/idea/ci-navigation.png" alt="A source file showing a CI Test Run inlay." style="width:100%;" >}}

Clicking the link opens the **Test Runs** tab showing the recent history for one test case.

## Requirements

- **A Datadog account**: The plugin requires a Datadog account (except when using [Static Analysis][13] features). If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][3] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.

## Setup

### Install the Datadog plugin

1. Click **Plugins** and search for `Datadog`.
1. Click **Install** to download and install the plugin in your IDE.
1. If you receive a prompt notifying you that Datadog is a third-party plugin, click **Accept**.
1. Click **Restart IDE**.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/idea/install-plugin.png" alt="The Datadog plugin" style="width:100%;" >}}

Alternatively, you can install the plugin from the [JetBrains Marketplace][4].

### Log in to Datadog

After installing the Datadog plugin and restarting the IDE, log in to Datadog:
1. With a file or project open in the IDE, click the **Datadog** tool window.
1. Click **Log in...**.
1. In the browser window that opens, select your site and organization, then authorize access to the platform.

**Note**: For most users, one login is all that is required. If you're using a multi-org setup, check to ensure that the correct account is active. To find out which login your IDE is using, click **Settings** -> **Tools** -> **Datadog**, and check which account is active.

### Link a service

To provide relevant data from the Datadog platform, add related services to your project:
1. With your project open in the IDE, open the **Datadog** tool window and select **Manage Linked Services...** from the **Options** menu.
1. A settings dialog opens, click the plus icon (**+**).
1. Search for and select the services that you want to add to the current project.

To remove a service, select it in the **Services** table and click the minus icon (**-**).

<div class="alert alert-info">The names of linked services persist with the project when you close it.</div>

## Feedback

You can give feedback in the [discussion forum][1], or send an e-mail to [team-ide-integration@datadoghq.com][11].

## Data and Telemetry
Datadog collects information about your usage of this IDE, including how you interact with it, whether errors occurred while using it, and what caused those errors, in accordance with the [Datadog Privacy Policy][16] and [Datadog's EULA][17].

If you don't wish to send this data to Datadog, you can disable the collection at any time in the settings: `Settings > Tools > Datadog > Data Sharing` and disable the `Send usage statistics` option.
