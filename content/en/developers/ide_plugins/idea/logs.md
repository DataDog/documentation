## Overview
The Logs integration detects log lines in your source code, displays live event counts directly in the source editor, and provides links to the Datadog [Log Explorer][16] to view the logs generated by each log line.

Hover over a log element with your mouse pointer to see matching log patterns with runtime value ranges. Use this runtime context to quickly understand how your code behaves in production or other deployed environments.

## Log Queries
Click the log icon to query logs using Datadog:

This launches the Log Explorer with the latest log events showing.  Notice how the query has been prefilled with the environment, log status, logger name and text elements extracted from your source code:

## Supported Languages & Frameworks
The following languages and logging frameworks are supported:

* Java & Kotlin : [SLF4J][1], [Log4j 2][2], [java.util.logging][3]
* Go : [Logrus][4], [Zap][5] and the [log package][6] in the Standard Library
* Python : [Python logging][7] and [Loguru][8]
* JavaScript & TypeScript : [Datadog Browser Logs][9] and [Winston][10]
* PHP : [Laravel][11], [Monolog][12], [Symfony][13] and [PSR-3][14] 

## Settings
Right-click a log element in the source editor to open the settings for the current language, and activate or deactivate the feature.

### Java / Kotlin
By convention logs are usually tagged with the logger name corresponding to the fully qualified class name of the class where the logger is created.  

A few Datadog customers post-process their logs data and modify the logger name tag to use only the simple class name–for these customers, there is a “Logger name” setting to inform the plugin to create Log Explorer queries that use the simple class name.

### Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and PHP
For these languages, there are no custom settings, only the activate/deactivate checkbox.

## Advanced Settings
For a normal setup, the advanced settings are not required. However, a few Datadog customers have log events with a non-standard [logger name attribute][15]. You can change the “Logger name tag” setting accordingly.]
