## Overview

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) integrates with Datadog to accelerate your development. It is also available for Cursor and other forks of VS Code. To install in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE):

- [Visual Studio Marketplace][2]: Install the extension for VS Code.
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/datadog/datadog-vscode): Download the VSIX file to install for Cursor and other forks of VS Code.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/datadog-vscode-2.png" alt="The Datadog for VS Code extension" style="width:100%;" >}}

The extension includes these features:

- [**Log Annotations**](#log-annotations): Gauge log volumes and search logs from your code.

- [**Code Insights**](#code-insights): Stay informed about runtime errors, vulnerabilities, and flaky tests without leaving the code.

- [**View in VS Code**](#view-in-ide) or [**View in Cursor**](#view-in-ide): Jump directly from code references in Datadog to your source files.

- [**Static Code Analysis**](#static-code-analysis): Detect and fix problems before you commit changes.

- [**Exception Replay**](#exception-replay): Debug your production code.

## Requirements

- **Datadog account**: Most features require a Datadog account.  
  - New to Datadog? [Learn more][1] about Datadogâ€™s monitoring and security tools and sign up for a free trial.  
  - If your organization uses a custom sub-domain such as `myorg.datadoghq.com`, you must indicate it using the `datadog.connection.oauth.setup.domain` setting.

- **Git**: The extension works better when Git is enabled in the IDE. Ensure this is enabled by checking the `git.enabled` setting.

## Log annotations

Use **Log Annotations** to gauge the volume of logs generated by a given log line in your code. The extension adds CodeLens annotations to detected logging patterns that match log records in Datadog. Click an annotation to open the [Log Explorer][28] in Datadog and view the matching logs.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/logs_navigation.mp4" alt="Preview of Logs Navigation" style="width:100%" video=true >}}

You can also search Datadog logs from within VS Code. Select any text in the code editor, then right-click and select **Datadog \> Search Logs With Selected Text**.

{{< img src="developers/ide_plugins/vscode/log_search.png" alt="Using the Datadog Log explorer feature" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Code insights

**Code insights** keep you informed with Datadog-generated insights that are relevant to your code base:

- Runtime errors collected by [Error Tracking][10]  
- Code and library vulnerabilities reported by [Code Security][11]  
- Flaky tests detected by [Test Optimization][12]

The extension identifies errors and vulnerabilities in the code with colored squiggles; hover over the line for more details.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/code-insights-inline-hover.mp4" alt="Hovering over inline code insights" style="width:100%" video=true >}}

The **Code Insights** view in the Datadog sidebar lists all the issues found in the repository. Select an item to view the full insight, and use the links to jump to the related source code location or open the code insight in Datadog.

You can group code insights by kind, file, priority, or service. You can also ignore individual code insights and set filters to view the ones you're most interested in.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/code-insights.png" alt="The Code Insights view." style="width:100%;" >}}

For specific insights about the file currently open in the active editor, check the **File Insights** view in the IDE's file explorer. This view also lists issues discovered by [Static Code Analysis](#static-code-analysis) within the file.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/file_insights_view.mp4" alt="File Insights view" style="width:100%" video=true >}}

## View in IDE

The **View in VS Code** or **View in Cursor** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed in the UI (for example, in [Error Tracking][10]):

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/view-in-vscode.png" alt="A stack trace in Datadog showing the View in VS Code button" style="width:100%;" >}}

You can also use this feature to open your source files from an insight (such as an error from Error Tracking):

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/view-in-vscode-error.png" alt="An Error Tracking issue in the Datadog showing the View in VS Code button" style="width:100%;" >}}

<div class="alert alert-info">To use this feature, first configure <a href="/integrations/guide/source-code-integration/">source code integration</a> for your service.</div>

## Static Code Analysis

[Static Code Analysis][14] analyzes your code (locally) against predefined rules to detect and fix problems.

The extension runs Static Code Analysis rules on the source files you have open in your workspace. This allows you to detect and fix problems such as maintainability issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in the code before you commit your changes.

Static Code Analysis supports scanning for many programming languages. For a complete list, see [Static Code Analysis Rules][15]. For file types belonging to supported languages, issues are shown in the source code editor, and you can directly apply suggested fixes.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/static_analysis.mp4" alt="Preview of Static Analysis" style="width:100%" video=true >}}

### Get started with Static Code Analysis

When you start editing a source file, the extension checks for [`static-analysis.datadog.yml`][22] at your source repository's root. It prompts you to create it if necessary.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/static-analysis-onboard.png" alt="Onboarding banner for setting up Static Code Analysis with Python files" style="width:75%;" >}}

After you create the configuration file, the analyzer runs automatically in the background whenever you open a file. If you need to enable Static Code Analysis for a particular language, use the `Datadog: Configure Static Analysis Languages` command from the command palette (`Shift` + `Cmd` + `P`, then search for the command).

You can also run a batch analysis for individual folders and even the entire workspace. In the IDE's file explorer view, right-click a folder and select **Datadog Static Analysis > Analyze Folder** or **Analyze Workspace**.

<!-- <div style="width:600px; height:400px; background-color:#CCCCCC; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">image placeholder: video of batch analysis</div><br /> -->

<div class="alert alert-info">Static Code Analysis does not require a Datadog account, as source files are analyzed locally.</div>

## Exception Replay

**Exception Replay** allows you to inspect the stack trace frames of any Error Tracking code insight and get information about the values of the variables of the code running in production.

To access this feature, you must enable [Error Tracking Exception Replay][29] on Datadog.

After the feature has been enabled, you can see an **Exception Replay** button next to the stack trace section of any instrumented Error Tracking code insight. Click the button to:

- Access all the information Datadog has about the different frames.
- Navigate through the production code.
- Review the value of the different variables involved.

Select an Error Tracking code insight from the Code Insights view. Go to the stack trace and click the Exception Replay button. The IDE shows a new activity with two new views:

- **Variables**: Displays the variables related to a particular stack trace frame.
- **Stack Trace**: Lists the stack frames for navigation.

Select a stack trace frame and inspect the values of all the variables that Datadog captured from your production code.

## License

Read the [End-User License Agreement][23] carefully before downloading or using the Datadog Visual Studio Code extension.

## Data and telemetry

Datadog anonymously collects information about your usage of this IDE, including how you interact with it, whether errors occurred while using it, and what caused those errors, in accordance with the [Datadog Privacy Policy][24] and Datadog's [VS Code extension EULA][23].

If you don't wish to send this data to [Datadog][1], you can opt out at any time in the extension's settings: `Datadog > Telemetry > Setup > Enable Telemetry` and select `disabled`.

<div class="alert alert-info">The Datadog extension also honors the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/telemetry#_output-channel-for-telemetry-events">VS Code telemetry</a> setting.</div>

## Help and feedback

To share your feedback, email [team-ide-integration@datadoghq.com][3] or create an issue in the extension's [public repository][26].
