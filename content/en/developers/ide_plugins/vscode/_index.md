## Overview

The Datadog extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) integrates with Datadog to accelerate your development.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/datadog-vscode-2.png" alt="The Datadog for VS Code extension" style="width:100%;" >}}

It packs several features, including:

- [**Code Insights**](#code-insights) to keep you informed about

  - Issues from [Error Tracking][10]
  - Reports by [Application Vulnerability Management][11]
  - [Flaky tests][12] detected by CI Visibility

- [**View in VS Code**](#view-in-vs-code) to directly go from your file references on the Datadog platform to your source files.

- [**Logs Navigation**](#logs-navigation) to allow you to search for logs from your code.

- [**Code Delta**](#code-delta) to more accurately map observability data to your files in VS Code.

- [**Static Analysis**](#static-analysis) to detect and fix problems even before you commit changes.

- [**Exception Replay**](#exception-replay) to help you debug your production code.

## Requirements

- **A Datadog account**: The extension requires a Datadog account (except when using [Static Analysis][14] features). If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][1] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.

- **VS Code Git**: The extension works better when VS Code Git integration is enabled. You can ensure that the integration is enabled by checking the `git.enabled` setting.

## Setup

Install the [Datadog Extension][2] from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Code Insights

The **Code Insights** tree displays insights generated by the Datadog platform that are relevant to your code-base. The insights are grouped into three categories: performance, reliability, and security.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/code-insights.png" alt="The Code Insights view." style="width:100%;" >}}

Code Insights include a detailed description for each issue, and links to:

- The related source code location
- The Datadog platform for additional information

You can dismiss individual Code Insights and set filters to view the ones you are most interested in.

## View in VS Code

The **View in VS Code** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed in the UI (for example, in [Error Tracking][10]):

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/view-in-vscode.png" alt="A stack trace on the Datadog platform showing the View in VS Code button." style="width:100%;" >}}

<div class="alert alert-info">To use this feature, first configure <a href="/integrations/guide/source-code-integration/">source code integration</a> for your service.</div>

## Logs navigation

You can navigate to the [Log Explorer][28] on the [Datadog platform][1] directly from your source code files.

If you're using a supported logging library, the extension is able to show you code lenses on the lines where it has detected log patterns that match the Datadog platform records:

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/logs_navigation.mp4" alt="Preview of Logs Navigation" style="width:100%" video=true >}}

The supported logging libraries are:

- JavaScript
  - [@datadog/browser-logs][16]
  - [Winston][17]
  - [Pino][18]
  - [Bunyan][19]
  - [Log4js][20]
- Python
  - [logging][21]

Alternatively, you can select some text in your source code, right click on them, and look for the **Datadog > Search Logs With Selected Text** option.

{{< img src="developers/ide_plugins/vscode/log_search.png" alt="Using the Datadog Log explorer feature" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Code Delta

Code Delta matches the line numbers included in Datadog telemetry to the line numbers of the files you are currently working on in VS Code.

For example, all [View in VS Code](#view-in-vs-code) links on the Datadog platform encode runtime version info, and the extension uses that to compute the corresponding line of code in your editor, taking into account version changes.

You can tweak the Code Delta settings to change how the matching algorithm works. In particular, you can modify the `Minimum Affinity` value, which determines the degree of confidence required to match lines.

## Static Analysis

The [Static Analysis][14] integration analyzes your code (locally) against predefined rules to detect and fix problems.

The Datadog extension runs [Static Analysis][14] rules on the source files you have open in your Workspace. The goal is to detect and fix problems such as maintainability issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in your code before you commit your changes.

[Static Analysis][14] supports scanning for many programming languages. For a complete list, see [Static Analysis Rules][15]. For file types belonging to supported languages, issues are shown in the source code editor with the VS Code inspection system, and suggested fixes can be applied directly.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/static_analysis.mp4" alt="Preview of Static Analysis" style="width:100%" video=true >}}

### Getting started

When you start editing a source file, the extension checks for [static-analysis.datadog.yml][22] at your source repository's root. It prompts you to create it if necessary.

{{< img src="/developers/ide_plugins/vscode/static-analysis-onboard.png" alt="A banner for onboarding." style="width:100%;" >}}

Once the configuration file is created, the static analyzer runs automatically in the background.

<div class="alert alert-info">The Static Analysis feature does not require a Datadog account, as source files are analyzed locally.</div>

## Exception Replay

Exception Replay allows you to navigate through the stack trace frames of any Error Tracking code insight and get information about the values of the variables of the code running in production.

In order to get access to this feature, you have to enable [Error Tracking Exception Replay][29] on Datadog.

After the feature has been enabled, you can see an `Exception Replay` button next to the stack trace section of any instrumented Error Tracking code insight. If you click over it, you can:

- access all the information Datadog has about the different frames
- navigate through the production code
- review the value of the different variables involved

Select an Error Tracking code insight from the Code Insights view. Go to the stack trace and click the Exception Replay button. VS Code shows a new activity with two new views:

- **Variables**: It shows the variables related to a particular stack trace frame.
- **Stack Trace**: It allows you to navigate through the different stack trace frames.

Select a stack trace frame and inspect the values of all the variables that Datadog captured from your production code.

## License

Please read this [End-User License Agreement][23] carefully before downloading or using the Datadog Visual Studio Code Extension.

## Data and telemetry

Datadog anonymously collects information about your usage of this IDE, including how you interact with it, whether errors occurred while using it, and what caused those errors, in accordance with the [Datadog Privacy Policy][24] and Datadog's [VS Code extension EULA][23].

If you don't wish to send this data to [Datadog][1], you can opt out at any time in the VS Code extension settings: `Datadog > Telemetry > Setup > Enable Telemetry` and select `disabled`.

<div class="alert alert-info">The Datadog extension also honors the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_output-channel-for-telemetry-events">VS Code telemetry</a> telemetry setting.</div>

## Help and feedback

To share your feedback, email [team-ide-integration@datadoghq.com][3] or create an issue in the extension's [public repository][26].

Check out the [issues][27] section to discover known issues.
