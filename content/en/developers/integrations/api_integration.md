## Overview

This page guides Technology Partners through creating an official Datadog API integration. API integrations are best suited for SaaS-based vendors that can host a service to interact with the [Datadog API][1].

Most integrations submit [metrics][2], [logs][3], or [events][4], but you can also use other endpoints as needed, such as creating [incidents][5] or querying [users][6].

Once published, your integration appears in the Datadog app as a tile. This tile is where users connect their accounts and can learn more about the integration.

## Requirements

- Your product must be generally available
- Your product must host the source code that interacts with the Datadog API
- Your integration must submit telemetry to Datadog
- Your integration must implement OAuth for authorization (see below for more details)

## Building an API integration
These steps assume you've [joined the Datadog Partner Network][7] and have access to a partner developer organization.

1. [Implement OAuth 2.0 for Datadog in your product](#implement-oauth-20-for-datadog-in-your-product).
2. [Add your OAuth client details in the Developer Platform](#add-your-oauth-client-details-in-the-developer-platform).
3. [Test OAuth in your partner developer organization](#test-oauth-in-your-partner-developer-organization).

### Implement OAuth 2.0 for Datadog in your product
OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard authorization framework that enables secure access to Datadog APIs without exposing user credentials. It issues scoped, revocable tokens, offering stronger security and a better user experience than API or application keys.

1. Determine the required [scopes][8] for your integration use case.
2. Implement OAuth following [these steps][9]. 
3. Ensure the following Datadog-specific concepts are account for:
    - Datadog organizations may be deployed in different regions, represented by the `domain` parameter (for example, `datadoghq.com`, `ap1.datadoghq.com`). This affects both the OAuth handshake and the API endpoints you use.
    - Some customers use a custom subdomain, represented by the `site` parameter (for example, `customsub.datadoghq.com`). This is only used in the OAuth handshake and doesnâ€™t affect API endpoints.
    - Your product must direct users to initiate the OAuth flow from Datadog, so Datadog can provide the `domain` and `site` parameters to your onboarding URL. These parameters are not included if the flow starts from your product.
    - To submit data to Datadog, your integration must request the `api_keys_write` scope and make an [API call during the OAuth handshake][10] to create an API key on behalf of the user.

### Add your OAuth client details in the Developer Platform
These steps assume you've already created a listing in the Developer Platform.

1. Navigate to the **Configuration Method** tab for your listing and select **API with OAuth**.
2. Enter your **OAuth Client Name** (this should match your integration name).
3. Enter your **Onboarding URL**. This is where users are redirected after clicking **Connect Accounts** from the Datadog integration tile.
4. Add one or more **Redirect URIs**.
5. Click **Generate OAuth Client Secret** to create credentials for testing.
6. Record the client secret (it won't be shown again).
7. Select the minimum scopes required for your integration.
    - **Note**: Enable the `api_keys_write` scope to submit data (metrics, logs, events, etc.) to Datadog.
8. Click **Save Changes**.

### Test OAuth in your partner developer organization 
Until your integration is published by Datadog, you can only test OAuth within your Datadog partner developer organization.

1. Click **Test Authorization** to simulate initiation from the Datadog integration tile. This replicates a redirect to your onboarding URL with the `domain` and `site` parameters.
2. Complete the OAuth flow using your Datadog partner developer organization.
3. Verify that your integration can submit, query, or interact with data as intended.
4. Once OAuth works as expected, you're ready to submit your OAuth information with your listing. Before submitting:
    - Replace or remove any testing URLs from the **Onboarding URL** and **Redirect URIs** fields.
    - Upon submission, you'll receive production client credentials. Store the client secret securely (it will not be shown again). 

## Troubleshooting

### The list of API scopes does not include sending metrics, events, and logs

To send data to Datadog, use the `api_keys_write` scope when generating an API key on behalf of the user. For more information, see [Create an API key](#create-an-api-key).


### Invalid client ID

Error
: `invalid_request - Invalid client_id parameter value`

Until an OAuth client is published, you can only authorize the client from the account it was created in (the partner's sandbox account). This error occurs if you try to authorize the client outside of that account before the client is published.

If you've already published your OAuth client, remember to use the client ID and the client secret you were given at submission. The client secret was displayed only once, so if you've lost it, contact [ecosystems@datadog.com][11] for assistance.

### Forbidden errors

Error
: `{"errors":["Forbidden"]}`

This error might be related to an app key or an issue with your API authentication credentials.

#### App key use

OAuth clients use an `access_token` for authentication. Use the `access_token` to make calls to Datadog API endpoints by sending it as a part of the authorization header of your request:

```python
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer {}".format(access_token)}
```

For more information, see [Implement the OAuth protocol][12].

### API requests

If you're getting a forbidden error when trying to make an API call to a specific endpoint and you've enabled the correct scope for that endpoint, it's possible your API key, session, or OAuth token is invalid or has expired.

#### API key and token expiration

Refresh tokens do not expire unless the user revokes authorization or the partner revokes the token. If the partner revokes the token, the user must reauthorize the integration to generate new refresh and access tokens. For more information, see the [OAuth2 Authorization Endpoints Reference][13].

#### Retrieving API keys in your partner sandbox account

After you create a key using the [`/api/v2/api_keys/marketplace` endpoint][14], the key is returned in the response. The key cannot be regenerated or viewed again. Ensure you store the key securely for continuous data transmission. If you lose your API key, follow these steps to revoke and recreate it:

1. Navigate to the [Datadog API Keys Management page][15].
2. Look for the API key named `OAuth Client API Key` and select it.
3. Click **Revoke** to disable the API key.
4. Follow the steps in [Create an API key](#create-an-api-key) to create a new key.
5. Reinstall the integration and repeat the OAuth flow.

### Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames

Error
: `Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames`

When connecting to the Datadog API, do not include the subdomain in the API call. For example, use `datadoghq.eu` instead of `bigcorp.datadoghq.eu`.

### Mismatching redirect URI

Error
: `invalid_request - Mismatching redirect URI`

This error is usually the result of configuration differences between your testing client and your published client. Verify the following:
- Ensure you are using the correct `client_id` during authorization. For example, you might be using the `client_id` of your testing client instead of the client_id of your published client.
- Confirm you are using the correct redirect URI. For example, if your client is published, the redirect URI should match the one configured for production, and not the URI you used for testing.
- Ensure you are using the correct client. Use your testing client until the integration is published to your sandbox account.

### Applications with subdomains

Datadog does not support multi-tenanted applications where customers authorize using individual subdomains; instead, authorization is supported only through a single domain.

### OAuth with PKCE

Error
: `Invalid code or code verifier`

For issues with the PKCE OAuth flow, ensure the `content-type` header is correctly set to `application/json` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### Regenerating client secrets and secret rotation

If your secret was leaked and needs to be rotated, contact [ecosystems@datadog.com][11]. Only one secret can be active at a time. After you regenerate your secret, the existing secret is deleted. You do not need to re-authorize the integration.
