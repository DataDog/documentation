## Overview

Set up Sensitive Data Scanner to scan your:

- Telemetry data, so you can identify sensitive data in your logs, APM spans, and RUM events. See [Set Up for telemetry data][1] for instructions.
- Cloud storage data, so you can identify sensitive data in your Amazon S3 buckets and RDS instances. See [Set Up for Cloud Storage][2] for instructions.
