## Overview

Sensitive Data Scanner is a stream-based, pattern matching service used to identify, tag, and optionally redact or hash sensitive data. When a sensitive data issue is found, you might have the following questions:

- What sensitive data has been exposed?
- What is the priority of the sensitive data exposure?
- How severe is the issue in terms of spread and volume?
- Where did the sensitive data come from?

The Sensitive Data Scanner's [Summary][1] page categorizes and prioritizes sensitive data issues so that you can investigate, collaborate, and document your findings, and answer those questions.

## Triage sensitive data issues

Use the [Summary][1] page to see all sensitive data issues within the selected timeframe and start investigating issues.

In the **Sensitive Data Issues** section, filter by a priority level to see only issues with that priority level in the **Issues Overview** section. In the **Cases** section, filter by a case status to see issues associated to cases with that status in the **Issues Overview** section.

To investigate an issue:

1. Click on the issue in the **Issues Overview**.
2. In the issue panel, click **View Recent Changes** to navigate to [Audit Trail][4] and see if there are any recent configuration changes that caused the sensitive data issue.
3. Click **View All Logs** to see in Log Explorer all logs matching the query.  
Click **View All APM Spans** to see in Trace Explorer all traces matching the query.
