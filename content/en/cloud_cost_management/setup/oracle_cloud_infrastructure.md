## Overview

To set up Cloud Cost Management for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in Datadog, you should:
1. Have an OCI tenancy
2. Have the [OCI integration][1] installed in Datadog

## Setup

### Configure the OCI integration
Navigate to [Setup & Configuration][2] and follow the steps to configure the OCI integration for your parent tenancy.

**Note**: If the OCI integration was created without the QuickStart method, then you need to follow the [documentation][3] for QuickStart migration.

### Enable Cloud Cost Management
Once the integration is created, enable the toggle for Cloud Cost Management.

## Cost types
You can visualize your ingested data using the following cost types:

| Cost Type                                       | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------|
| `oci.cost.amortized`                            | Total cost of resources allocated at the time of usage over an interval. Costs include all applicable discounts |
| `oci.cost.ondemand`                             | Total public, on-demand cost of resources before public and private discounts are applied over an interval. |

### Out-of-the-box tags
Datadog adds out-of-the-box tags to ingested cost data to help you further break down and allocate your costs. These tags are derived from your [FOCUS cost export][] and make it easier to discover and understand cost data.

The following out-of-the-box tags are available for filtering and grouping data:

| Tag Name                         | Tag Description       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `availabilityzone`             | The Google service being billed.|
| `billingaccountid`           | The type of charge covered by this item (for example, regular, tax, adjustment, or rounding error).|
| `billingaccountname`          | The usage details of the item (for example, Standard Storage US).|
| `billingcurrency`            | The location associated with the item at the level of a multi-region, country, region, or zone.|
| `chargecategory`              | The region associated with the item.|
| `chargedescription`                | The availability zone associated with the item.|
| `chargefrequency`  | The pricing unit used for calculating the usage cost (for example, gibibyte, tebibyte, or year).|
| `chargesubcategory`| Whether the usage was reserved but not used.|
| `commitmentdiscountcategory`| Whether the usage was reserved but not used.|
| `commitmentdiscountid`| Whether the usage was reserved but not used.|
| `commitmentdiscountname`| Whether the usage was reserved but not used.|
| `commitmentdiscounttype`| Whether the usage was reserved but not used.|
| `invoiceissuername` | The Google Cloud service (such as Compute Engine or BigQuery). |
| `pricingcategory` | The ID of the Google Cloud project that generated the Cloud Billing data. |
| `pricingunit` | The name of the Google Cloud project that generated the Cloud Billing data. |
| `providername` | The type of cost this line item represents: `regular`, `tax`, `adjustment`, or `rounding error`. |
| `publishername` | A description of the resource type used, describing the usage details of the resource. |
| `region` | A name customers add to resources. This may not be on all resources. |
| `resourceid` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `resourcename` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `resourcetype` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `servicecategory` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `servicename` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `skuid` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `skupriceid` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `subaccountid` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `subaccountname` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |
| `usageunit` | A globally unique resource identifier generated by Google Cloud. |


#### Cost and observability correlation

Viewing costs in context of observability data is important to understand how infrastructure changes impact costs, identify why costs change, and optimize infrastructure for both costs and performance. Datadog updates resource identifying tags on cost data for top Google products to simplify correlating observability and cost metrics.

For example, to view cost and utilization for each Cloud SQL database, you can make a table with `gcp.cost.amortized`, `gcp.cloudsql.database.cpu.utilization`, and `gcp.cloudsql.database.memory.utilization` (or any other Cloud SQL metric) and group by `database_id`. Or, to see Cloud Function usage and costs side by side, you can graph `gcp.cloudfunctions.function.execution_count` and `gcp.cost.amortized` grouped by `function_name`.

The following out-of-the-box tags are available:
| Google Product     | Tag(s)                        |
| -------------------| ----------------------------- |
| Compute Engine     | `instance_id`, `instance-type`|
| Cloud Functions    | `function_name`               |
| Cloud Run          | `job_name`, `service_name`    |
| Cloud SQL          | `database_id`                 |
| Cloud Spanner      | `instance_id`                 |
| App Engine         | `module_id`                   |
| BigQuery           | `project_id`, `dataset_id`    |
| Kubernetes Engine  | `cluster_name`                |

### Container cost allocation
Container cost allocation is not available for OCI. See [Container Cost Allocation][14] for more details.
