## Overview
After you start ingesting your costs in Cloud Cost Management, set up budgets and easily visualize how you're tracking against budgets.

## Create a budget

1. Enter the following details:
   1. **Budget Name**
   2. **Start Date** - This can be a past month. Budgets are set at the month level.
   3. **End Date** - The end date can be in the future. Note: If both the start and end dates are in the past, you can not view that budget's status at this time.
   4. **Provider(s)** - Budget on any combination of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, any SaaS, Custom Costs, and even Datadog costs.
   5. **Dimension to budget by** - Specify a dimension to track the budget, along with the corresponding values. For example, if you have team budgets, for the top 4 teams, you would select "team" in the first dropdown, and the specific teams in the second dropdown.

## View budget status
The Budgets Page[1] lists all of your organization's budgets, highlighting budgets that are over budget, who created the budget,
and more details. Click on **View Performance** to investigate the budget, and understand what might be causing you to go over budget.

You can view the budget status in the current month or the full duration of the budget.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Note: You can not view budget vs actuals before 15 months, since cost metrics have 15 month retention at this time.

## Investigate budgets
Filter budgets using the "Filter to" at the top, or "Apply filter" in the table to investigate dimensions that are over budget.
Click on "Copy Link" to send the budget to others to help understand why budgets are going over.
Or, share budgets with finance so that they can understand how youâ€™re tracking against budgets.

## Delete budget
Click the trash icon on the Budgets page, or within an individual budget, to delete the budget.
