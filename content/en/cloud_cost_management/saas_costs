Fastly and Confluent Cloud Cost Integrations are in public beta. Snowflake Costs are in private beta, please ask your account team to have you added to the private beta.
{{< /beta-callout >}}

## Overview

SaaS Cost Integrations allow you to send cost data directly from your providers, with a one time set up.

Fastly, Confluent Cloud, and Snowflake integrations are available currently. If your provider is not supported via SaaS Cost Integrations, you can use [Custom Costs][1] to upload any cost data source to Datadog, so that you can understand the total cost of your services.

To use SaaS Cost Integrations, you must [configure Cloud Cost Management][1] for either AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Configure SaaS Cost Integrations

Navigate to [**Cloud Costs** > **Settings** > **Accounts**][101] and click on the provider you want to integrate. Cost data appears after 24 hours.

1. Create a new API token with at least "global:read" scope and "Billing" role on the [Personal API tokens][8] page.
2. Then integrate it with Datadog by clicking Add Account in the page.

1.  Create a Datadog specific role and user to monitor Snowflake. In Snowflake, run the following to create a custom role.
```
-- Create a new role intended to monitor Snowflake usage.
create role DATADOG;

-- Grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database to the new role.
grant imported privileges on database SNOWFLAKE to role DATADOG;

-- Grant usage to your default warehouse to the role DATADOG.
grant usage on warehouse <WAREHOUSE> to role DATADOG;

-- If you have cost usage collection enabled, ensure that your credentials have permission to view the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema.
grant role orgadmin to role DATADOG

-- Create a user.
create user DATADOG_USER
LOGIN_NAME = DATADOG_USER
password = <PASSWORD>
default_warehouse = <WAREHOUSE>
default_role = DATADOG

-- Grant the monitor role to the user.
grant role DATADOG to user <USER>
```
2. Configure the key pair authentication.
  1. Generate a private key following instructions [here][9].
  2. Generate a public key following instructions [here][10].
  3. Assign the public key to the user created in step 1 following instructions [here][11].

3. Then integrate it with Datadog by clicking Add Account in the page.

## Cost metric types

You can visualize your ingested data using the following cost types:

| Cost Type | Description |
| ----------| ----------------------------------|
| `custom.cost.amortized` | Total cost of resources accrued over an interval. |
| `custom.cost.basis` | Total cost of resources allocated at the time of usage over an interval. |

SaaS Cost Integration costs, and Custom Costs, appear in these metrics. Group by `provider_name` to see costs by each provider that you've integrated.

For example, if a $4 purchase was made on September 1, over the September 1-4 period, the following costs are attributed to each metric:

| Days | `custom.cost.basis` | `custom.cost.amortized` |
|---|---|---|
| September 1 | $4 | $1 |
| September 2 | - | $1 |
| September 3 | - | $1 |
| September 4 | - | $1 |

## Use SaaS Cost Integration data

You can view cost data on the [**Cloud Costs Analytics** page][3], the [Cloud Costs Tag Explorer][4], and in [dashboards][5], [notebooks][6], or [monitors][7]. You can also combine these cost metrics with other cloud cost metrics or observability metrics.
