## Overview
After you start ingesting your costs in Cloud Cost Management, set up budgets and visualize how you are tracking against budgets.

## Create a budget

1. Navigate to [**Cloud Cost > Plan > Budgets**][1].
2. Click the **Create a New Budget** button.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Budget Name**: Enter a name for your budget.
   - **Start Date**: Enter a start date for the budget (this can be a past month). Budgets are set at the month level.
   - **End Date**: Set an end date for the budget (can be in the future).
   - **Provider(s)**: Budget on any combination of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or other SaaS (including Datadog or custom costs).
   - **Dimension to budget by**: Specify a dimension to track the budget, along with its corresponding values. For example, if you wanted to create budgets for the top 4 teams, you would select "team" in the first dropdown, and the specific teams in the second dropdown.

4. Fill in all budgets in the table. You can automatically copy values from the first month to the rest of the months by clicking the copy button.

5. Click **Save** in the bottom right.

## View budget status
The [Budgets page][1] lists all of your organization's budgets, highlighting the budget creator, any budgets that have gone over,
and other relevant details. Click on **View Performance** to investigate the budget, and understand what might be causing you to go over budget.

From a **View Performance** page of an individual budget, you can toggle the view option from the top left:

<div class="alert alert-info">
You cannot view budget versus actuals before 15 months, since cost metrics are retained for 15 months.
</div>

- You can view the budget status for the **current month**:

- Or can view the budget status for the **entire duration (all)**:

## Investigate budgets

To investigate budgets:
1. From the individual budget page, filter budgets using the dropdown at the top, or "Apply filter" in the table to investigate dimensions that are over budget.
2. Click **Copy Link** to share the budget with others to help understand why budgets are going over. Or, share budgets with finance so that they can understand how you're tracking against budgets.

## Delete budget
To delete a budget, click the trash icon on the Budgets page.
