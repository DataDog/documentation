  Explore your cloud provider costs and correlate them with real-time telemetry data. Gain actionable insights and alerts on where your cloud costs are coming from, how they are changing, and where to find potential optimizations.
{{< /learning-center-callout >}}

## Overview

Cloud Cost Management provides insights for engineering and finance teams to understand how infrastructure changes impact costs, allocate spend across your organization, and identify inefficiencies.

{{< img src="cloud_cost/summary.png" alt="Gain insights into all of your cloud provider's cost and usage on the Cloud Costs Summary page in Datadog" style="width:100%;" >}}

Datadog ingests your cloud cost data and transforms it into metrics you can use in a search query on the [**Explorer** page][1]. If costs rise, you can correlate the increase with usage metrics to determine the root cause.

## Setup

{{< whatsnext desc="To start managing your cloud costs with Cloud Cost Management, see the following documentation.">}}

## Use cloud cost data

Visualize infrastructure spend alongside related utilization metrics with a retention period of 15 months to spot potential inefficiencies and savings opportunities.

When creating a dashboard, select **Cloud Cost** as the data source for your search query.

{{< img src="cloud_cost/cloud_cost_data_source-1.png" alt="Cloud Cost available as a data source in dashboard widget creation" style="width:80%;" >}}

Optionally, you can programmatically export a timeseries graph of your cloud cost data by using the [Metrics API][2].

## Use daily Datadog cost data

Visualize daily Datadog spending alongside related utilization metrics with a retention period of 15 months to spot potential inefficiencies and savings opportunities.

When creating a dashboard, select **Cloud Cost** as the data source for your search query.

Optionally, you can programmatically export a timeseries graph of your Datadog cost data by using the [Metrics API][2].

## Tagging and cost allocation

Use the [Tags documentation][5] to understand how tags are sourced, enriched, and managed in Cloud Cost Management.

You can create tag rules to correct missing or incorrect tags and add inferred tags that align with your organization's business logic.

## Create a cost monitor

Proactively manage and optimize your cloud spending by creating a [Cloud Cost Monitor][3]. You can choose **Cost Changes** or **Cost Threshold** to monitor your cloud expenses.

## Allocate costs

Use [Container Cost Allocation metrics][4] to discover costs associated with clusters and workloads across Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Gain visibility into pod-level costs, identify idle resource costs, and analyze costs by resource type.

## Permissions
Two permissions are available:
1. Cloud Cost Management Read (`cloud_cost_management_read`)
2. Cloud Cost Management Write (`cloud_cost_management_write`)

The table below describes the impact of these permissions in both Cloud Cost Management and related pages.
