## Overview

Cloud Cost Management provides insights for engineering and finance teams to understand how infrastructure changes impact costs, allocate spend across your organization, and identify inefficiencies.

{{< img src="cloud_cost/overview_1.png" alt="Gain insights into all of your cloud provider's cost and usage on the Cloud Costs Overview page in Datadog" style="width:100%;" >}}

Datadog ingests your cloud cost data and transforms it into metrics you can use in a search query on the [**Analytics** page][1]. If costs rise, you can correlate the increase with usage metrics to determine the root cause.

## Use cloud cost data

Visualize infrastructure spend alongside related utilization metrics with a retention period of 15 months to spot potential inefficiencies and savings opportunities. 

When creating a dashboard, select **Cloud Cost** as the data source for your search query.

{{< img src="cloud_cost/cloud_cost_data_source.png" alt="Cloud Cost available as a data source in dashboard widget creation" style="width:100%;" >}}

Optionally, you can programmatically export a timeseries graph of your cloud cost data by using the [Metrics API][2].

## Use daily Datadog cost data

Visualize daily Datadog spending alongside related utilization metrics with a retention period of 15 months to spot potential inefficiencies and savings opportunities.

When creating a dashboard, select **Cloud Cost** as the data source for your search query.

{{< img src="cloud_cost/datadog_costs/dashboard.png" alt="Datadog costs as an option for the Cloud Cost data source in a dashboard" style="width:100%;" >}} 

Optionally, you can programmatically export a timeseries graph of your Datadog cost data by using the [Metrics API][2].

## Create tag rules

Use [Tag Pipelines][5] to ensure comprehensive cost tracking by standardizing the tags across all cloud resources. This prevents any cost data from being overlooked. 

{{< img src="cloud_cost/tags_addnew.png" alt="Create a tag rule in Tag Pipelines to ensure your cloud resources use standard tags" style="width:60%;" >}}

You can create tag rules to correct missing or incorrect tags and add inferred tags that align with your organization's business logic.

## Create a cost monitor

Proactively manage and optimize your cloud spending by creating a [Cloud Cost Monitor][3]. You can choose **Cost Changes** or **Cost Threshold** to monitor your cloud expenses.

{{< img src="cloud_cost/monitor.png" alt="Create a Cloud Cost monitor that alerts on cost changes" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Allocate costs

Use [Container Cost Allocation metrics][4] to discover costs associated with clusters and workloads across Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Gain visibility into pod-level costs, identify idle resource costs, and analyze costs by resource type.
