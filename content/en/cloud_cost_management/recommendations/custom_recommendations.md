## Overview

CCM Recommendations lets you customize cost-saving suggestions to fit your business needs. You can set your own metric thresholds that trigger recommendations and evaluation time frames, helping you cut down on unnecessary alerts and focus on the recommendations that matter most.

## Customize a recommendation
To customize a recommendation, navigate to **Cloud Cost > Settings > Configure Recommendations**.

<div class="alert alert-info">Customizations reflect within 24 hours when recommendations are generated next.
</div>

In the **Configure Recommendations** list, you can see all cost recommendations available for customization.

- Recommendations that have been customized and used **once** have a **Configured** label attached to them. 
- Recommendations that have been customized and used **more than once** have a label with the **number of rules** that are associated with it.

### Setting metric thresholds

You can enter custom values for metric thresholds used to generate recommendations for resources. Metric thresholds unavailable for customization will be grayed out.

Customize the evaluation timeframe for a recommendation
You can also customize the evaluation timeframe over which metrics are evaluated to generate recommendations to fit your business' seasonality and conditions better. Evaluation timeframe options include:
- 1 week
- 2 weeks
- 15 days
- 3 weeks
- 1 month
- 2 months
- 3 months

### Add filters to the customization
Team, service, and environment filters are available when you select **Apply this rule to some resources** while customizing. These filters allow you to customize recommendations for more specific parts of your business and accommodate different needs.

### Choose a name and reason for the customization
Customization is complete once you create a name for the customization and add an optional reason.

## Customization history and enable/disable
**Write here about the history of customization and enabling/disabling to return to default recommendations**
