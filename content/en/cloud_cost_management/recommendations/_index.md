Cloud Cost Recommendations is in Preview with support for AWS, and is automatically enabled if you have set up <a href="/cloud_cost_management/">Cloud Cost Management</a>

## Overview

[Cloud Cost Recommendations][1] provide recommendations on reducing your cloud spending by optimizing the usage of your cloud resources. Datadog generates a set of recommendations by combining your observability data with your underlying cloud provider's billing data to identify orphaned, legacy, or over-provisioned cloud resources.

Recommendations are run on a daily basis and are automatically refreshed in your account as soon as the recommendations are released.

- For **all resources**, [cloud cost metrics][11] are also pulled for that resource
- For all **AWS resources** besides Kubernetes and EC2, AWS metrics are also pulled from [AWS CloudWatch][11]

You can see the detailed logic for each recommendation type, along with observability metrics or cost data shown on this page.

## Recommendation categories

Below are the available cloud cost recommendation categories and their descriptions.

| Recommendation Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Unused resource | Identified resources that are running on legacy hardware or are not utilized efficiently in your cloud environment. You can consider upgrading or removing these resources to reduce your costs and improve the performance of your resources. |
| Previous generation resource | Resources that are running on legacy hardware, which you can consider upgrading to reduce your costs and improve the performance of your resources. |
| Over-provisioned resource | Resources that are under-utilized or over-provisioned, which you can consider adjusting the size and configuration of to reduce your costs and improve the performance of your resources. |
| Rate optimization | Resources that are charged at on-demand rates or could benefit from rate optimization. You can consider modifying these resources to reduce your costs. |
| Architecture | Resources related to NAT gateways, which you can consider optimizing to reduce unnecessary charges. |

## Prerequisites

The following are requirements necessary to receive Cloud Cost recommendations:

- Cloud provider accounts (for all Cloud Cost recommendations)
- [AWS integration and resource collections][3] (for AWS recommendations)

## Setup

For each cloud account that you would like to receive recommendations for:

1. Configure [Cloud Cost Management][2] to send billing data to Datadog.
1. Enable [resource collection][3] in the **Resource Collection** tab on the [AWS integration tile][4].
1. Install the [Datadog Agent][5] (required for over-provisioned resource recommendations).
