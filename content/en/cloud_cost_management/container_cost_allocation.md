## Overview

Datadog Cloud Cost Management (CCM) automatically allocates EC2 compute cost in Kubernetes and ECS clusters to individual pods and tasks running in those clusters. Use cost metrics enriched with tags from pods, nodes, containers, and tasks to visualize container workload cost in the context of your entire cloud bill.

Additionally, CCM allocates the cost of non-local EBS Volumes used as Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes to individual pods that claim those volumes.

## Prerequisites

1. Set up and configure [AWS Cloud Cost integration][1].
2. (Optional) Enable [AWS Split Cost Allocation][5] for usage-based ECS allocation.
1. At least one of the following must be running:
    - [**Datadog Agent**][2] in a Kubernetes environment using EC2 instances. Ensure that you enable the [**Orchestrator Explorer**][6] in your Agent configuration.
    - [**Datadog Container Monitoring**][3] in ECS tasks.

## Cost allocation

Cost allocation divides EC2 and EBS volume costs in the [Cost and Usage Report][4] (CUR) into associated individual tasks or pods. These divided costs are then enriched with tags from nodes, pods, tasks, and volumes. This lets you break down costs by any associated dimensions.


### Kubernetes

#### Compute

For Kubernetes compute allocation, a Kubernetes node is joined with its associated EC2 instance costs. The node's cluster name and all node tags are added to the entire EC2 compute cost for the node. This allows you to associate cluster-level dimensions with the cost of the instance, without considering the pods scheduled to the node.

Next, Datadog looks at all of the pods running on that node for the day. The cost of the node is allocated to the pod based on the resources it has used and the length of time it ran. This calculated cost is enriched with all of the pod's tags.

**Note**: Only _tags_ from pods and nodes are added to cost metrics. To include labels, enable labels as tags for [nodes][7] and [pods][8].

#### Persistent volume storage

For Kubernetes Persistent Volume storage allocation, Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), nodes, and pods are joined with their associated EBS volume costs. All associated PV, PVC, node, and pod tags are added to the EBS volume cost line items.

Next, Datadog looks at all of the pods that claimed the volume on that day. The cost of the volume is allocated to a pod based on the resources it used and the length of time it ran. These resources
include the provisioned capacity for storage, IOPS, and throughput. This allocated cost is enriched with all of the pod's tags.


### ECS on EC2

For ECS allocation, Datadog determines which tasks ran on each EC2 instance used for ECS. If you enable AWS Split Cost Allocation, the metrics allocate ECS costs by usage instead of reservation, providing more granular detail.

Based on resources the task has used, Datadog assigns the appropriate portion of the instance's compute cost to that task. The calculated cost is enriched with all of the task's tags and all of the container tags (except container names) running in the task.

### ECS on Fargate

ECS tasks that run on Fargate are already fully allocated in the CUR. CCM enriches that data by adding out-of-the-box tags and container tags to the AWS Fargate cost.

### Everything else

The information on this page pertains to EC2 compute and EBS costs for EC2 instances hosting Kubernetes pods or ECS tasks. All other costs are given the same value and tags as the source metric, `aws.cost.amortized`.


## Understanding spend

Using the `allocated_spend_type` tag, you can visualize the spend category associated with your cost at the Kubernetes node, ECS host, EBS volume, or cluster level. Costs are allocated into three spend types:

### Compute

- Usage: Cost of memory and cpu being used or reserved by workloads.
- Workload idle: Cost of memory and cpu that is being reserved and allocated but not used by workloads.
- Cluster idle: Cost of memory and cpu not reserved by workloads in a cluster.

### Persistent volumes

- Usage: Cost of provisioned IOPS, throughput, or storage being used by workloads. Storage cost is based on the maximum amount of volume storage used that day. IOPS and throughput costs are based on the average amount used that day.
- Workload idle: Cost of provisioned IOPS, throughput, or storage not being used by workloads. Storage cost is based on the maximum amount of storage used that day. IOPS and throughput costs are based on the average amount used that day. *Note: This tag is only available if you have enabled `Resource Collection` in your [**AWS Integration**][9]. To prevent being charged for `Cloud Security Posture Management`, ensure that during the `Resource Collection` setup, the `Cloud Security Posture Management` box is unchecked.*
- Cluster idle: Cost of provisioned IOPS, throughput, or storage for volumes not claimed by any pods that day.

## Cost metrics

When the prerequisites are met, new AWS cost metrics automatically appear.

| AWS Cost Metric                    | Description    |
| ---                                | ----------- |
| `aws.cost.amortized.shared.resources.allocated` | EC2 costs allocated by the CPU & memory used by a pod or ECS task, using a 60:40 split for CPU & memory respectively. Also includes allocated EBS costs. <br> *Based on `aws.cost.amortized`* |
| `aws.cost.net.amortized.shared.resources.allocated` | Net EC2 costs allocated by CPU & memory used by a pod or ECS task, using a 60:40 split for CPU & memory respectively. Also includes allocated EBS costs. <br> *Based on `aws.cost.net.amortized`, if available* |
| `aws.cost.amortized.mem.allocated`   | EC2 costs allocated by memory used by a pod or ECS task. <br> *Based on `aws.cost.amortized`* |
| `aws.cost.net.amortized.mem.allocated` | Net EC2 costs allocated by memory used by a pod or ECS task <br> *Based on `aws.cost.net.amortized`, if available* |
| `aws.cost.amortized.cpu.allocated` | EC2 costs allocated by CPU used by a pod or ECS task <br> *Based on `aws.cost.amortized`* |
| `aws.cost.net.amortized.cpu.allocated` | Net EC2 costs allocated by CPU used by a pod or ECS task <br> *Based on `aws.cost.net.amortized`, if available* |

These new cost metrics include all of your AWS cloud costs. This allows you to continue visualizing all of your cloud costs at one time, with added visibility into pods and tasks running on EC2 instances.

For example, say you have the tag `team` on S3 buckets, RDS stores, and Kubernetes pods. You can use these new metrics to group costs by `team`, which includes costs for S3, RDS and compute expenses from tagged pods.

## Tags

Datadog consolidates and applies additional tags from various sources to cost metrics. Conflicts are resolved by favoring higher-specificity tags such as pod tags over lower-specificity tags such as host tags. For example, a Kubernetes pod tagged `service:datadog-agent` running on a node tagged `service:aws-node` results in a final tag `service:datadog-agent`.
