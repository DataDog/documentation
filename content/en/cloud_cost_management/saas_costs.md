SaaS Cost Integrations are in public beta.
{{< /beta-callout >}}

## Overview

SaaS Cost Integrations allow you to send cost data **directly from your providers** by configuring the accounts associated with your cloud cost data in Datadog. 

If your provider is not supported, use [Custom Costs][1] to upload any cost data source to Datadog and understand the total cost of your services.

## Setup

To use SaaS Cost Integrations, you must configure [Cloud Cost Management][2] for AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. 

{{< partial name="cloud_cost/getting-started.html" >}}

</br>

Navigate to [**Infrastructure > Cloud Costs > Settings > Accounts**][8] and click **Configure** on a provider to collect cost data. 

{{< img src="cloud_cost/saas_costs/all_accounts.png" alt="Add your accounts with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud to collect cost data. You can also add your accounts for Fastly, Snowflake, Confluent Cloud, MongoDB, Databricks, OpenAI, and Twilio" style="width:100%" >}}

## Use SaaS Cost Integration data

You can view cost data on the [**Cloud Costs Analytics** page][3], the [Cloud Costs Tag Explorer][4], and in [dashboards][5], [notebooks][6], or [monitors][7]. You can also combine these cost metrics with other cloud cost metrics or observability metrics.
