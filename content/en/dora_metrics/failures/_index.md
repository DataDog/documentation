## Overview

Failed deployments events, currently interpreted through incident events, are used to compute [change failure rate](#calculating-change-failure-rate) and [mean time to restore (MTTR)](#calculating-mean-time-to-restore). 

## Selecting an incident data source

{{< whatsnext desc="DORA Metrics supports the following data sources for deployment events. See the respective documentation to set up a data source for your deployment events:" >}}

## Calculating change failure rate 
Change failure rate requires both [deployment data][7] and [incident data](#configuring-failure-data-sources).

Change failure rate is calculated as the percentage of incident events out of the total number of deployments. Datadog divides `dora.incidents.count` over `dora.deployments.count` for the same services and/or teams associated to both an failure and a deployment event. 

## Calculating time to restore 
Time to restore is calculated as the duration distribution for *resolved incident* events.

DORA Metrics generates the `dora.time_to_restore` metric by recording the start and end times of each incident event. It calculates the mean time to restore (MTTR) as the average of these `dora.time_to_restore` data points over a selected time frame.
