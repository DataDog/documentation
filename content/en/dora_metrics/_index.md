## Overview

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics are [four key metrics][1] that indicate the velocity and stability of software development. 

Deployment frequency
: How often an organization successfully releases to production.

Lead time for changes
: The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.

Change failure rate
: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.

Time to restore service
: How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.

Defining and tracking DORA metrics can help you identify areas of improvement for your team or organization's speed and quality of software delivery.

## Set up DORA Metrics

To start configuring data sources to send deployment and incident events to Datadog, see the [Setup documentation][2].

## Analyze DORA Metrics

Once you've set up the data sources for your deployment and failure events, navigate to [**Software Delivery** > **DORA Metrics**][4] to identify improvements or regressions for each metric, aggregate them by service or environment, and compare trends over time.

You can access and visualize your DORA metrics and filter them by team, service, repository, environment, and time period on the [**DORA Metrics** page][4]. For more information about the metrics calculated by DORA Metrics, see the [Data Collected documentation][3].

You can also export your DORA Metrics data to dashboards or notebooks and create [metric monitors][5] to trigger alerts on your metrics. For more information, see the [Monitors documentation][6].
