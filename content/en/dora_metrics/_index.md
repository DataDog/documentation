## Overview

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics are [four key metrics][1] that indicate the velocity and stability of software development.

Deployment frequency
: How often an organization successfully releases to production.

Change lead time
: The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.

Change failure rate
: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.

Time to restore service
: How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.

Defining and tracking DORA metrics can help you identify areas of improvement for your team or organization's speed and quality of software delivery.

## Set up DORA Metrics

To start configuring data sources to send deployment and failure events to Datadog, see the [Setup documentation][2].

## Analyze DORA Metrics

Once you've set up the data sources for your deployment and failure events, navigate to [**Software Delivery** > **DORA Metrics**][4] to identify improvements or regressions for each metric, aggregate them by service or environment, and compare trends over time.

You can examine visualizations and filter the collected data by team, service, repository, environment, time period, and by custom tags.

Click **View Deployments** to open a new tab with the Deployment Frequency and Change Lead Time metrics in addition to a list of deployment events.

Click **View Failures** to open a side panel with the Change Failure Rate and Time To Restore metrics in addition to a list of failure events.

## Use DORA Metrics data

### Export DORA Metrics widgets
Export your visualization widgets to dashboards, notebooks, or add them to existing incidents.

{{< img src="dora_metrics/dora_ui_2.png" alt="Click the Export icon to add the visualization widget to an incident or to a dashboard or notebook" style="width:100%;" >}}

Click the **Export** icon on any visualization to add it to an incident, dashboard, or notebook. For more information about the metrics calculated by DORA Metrics, see the [Data Collected documentation][3].

### Create custom dashboards

DORA metrics are highly flexible and can be used in custom dashboards to fit your teamâ€™s specific needs.

{{< img src="dora_metrics/dashboard.png" alt="An example of a custom DORA Metrics Dashboard" style="width:100%;" >}}

Within dashboards and graphs, custom tags are treated as [attributes][7]. In order to filter or group by a custom tag, it must be prefixed with an `@` symbol.
