## Overview

The four DORA Metrics are calculated based on two types of events:

- [**Deployment events**][8]: Indicate that a new deployment has occurred for a service in a specific environment. 
- [**Incident events**][9]: Indicate that a new failure has occurred for a service in a specific environment.

Each event type supports different data sources.

## Configure data sources

### Deployments 
{{< whatsnext desc="Deployment events are used to compute deployment frequency, change lead time, and change failure rate. See the respective documentation to set up a data source for your deployment events:" >}}
  {{< nextlink href="/dora_metrics/deployments/apm" >}}APM Deployment Tracking{{< /nextlink >}}
  {{< nextlink href="/dora_metrics/deployments/deployment_api" >}}Deployment Event API or datadog-ci CLI{{< /nextlink >}}
{{< /whatsnext >}}

### Failures
{{< whatsnext desc="Failure events, interpreted through incident events, are used to compute change failure rate and mean time to restore. See the respective documentation to set up a data source for your failure events:">}}

## Limitations
- When you first select a data source option (such as APM Deployment Tracking or PagerDuty), DORA Metrics begins populating data from that point forward. If you switch from source A to source B, then back to source A, the historical data from source A is only available from the time it was first selected. 
- Deployments or incidents of the same service cannot occur at the same second.
