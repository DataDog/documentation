## Overview

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics are [four key metrics][1] used to indicate the velocity and stability of software development.

Deployment Frequency
: How often an organization successfully releases to production.

Lead Time for Changes
: The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.

Change Failure Rate
: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.

Time to Restore Service
: How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.

Defining and tracking DORA metrics can help you identify areas of improvement for your team or organization's speed and quality of software delivery.
