## Overview

DORA Metrics generates [metrics][9] for each one of the four core DORA Metrics, as well as events with associated tags and attributes that are available in the [Events Explorer][1].

## DORA metrics

DORA Metrics provides the following default metrics:


| DORA Metric | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Deployment Frequency | count | The number of deployments detected by Datadog based on your selected [deployment data source][10].
| Change Lead Time | distribution | The age in `seconds` of associated Git commits at the time of deployment.
| Change Failure Rate | count | Calculated dividing the number of failures by the number of deployments.
| Time to Restore | distribution | The time in `seconds` between a failure's `started_at` and `finished_at` timestamps.

### Default tags

All default metrics contain the following tags if any are available:

- `service`
- `team`
- `env`
- `repository_id`

**Note**: The `severity` tag is available for failure events when it is provided by the failure's data source.

For more information about using `env`, `service`, and `version` tags, see [Getting Started with Tags][6].

## Change lead time metrics

Datadog breaks down change lead time into the following metrics, which represent the different stages from commit creation to deployment.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `time_to_pr_ready` | duration | Time from when the commit is created until the PR is ready for review. This metric is only available for commits that were made before the PR was marked as ready for review. |
| `review_time` | duration | Time from when the PR is marked ready for review until it receives the last approval. This metric is only available for commits that were made before the PR is approved. |
| `merge_time` | duration | Time from the last approval until the PR is merged. |
| `time_to_deploy` | duration | Time from PR merge to start of deployment. If a commit does not have an associated PR, this metric is calculated as the time from commit creation to start of deployment. |
| `deploy_time` | duration | Time from start of deployment to end of deployment. This metric is not available if there is no deployment duration information. |

These metrics are only computed when the source of the repository metadata is GitHub, and there must be a pull request (PR) associated with a commit, if any. A commit is associated with a PR if the commit is first introduced to the target branch when merging that PR. If a commit does not have an associated PR, only `time_to_deploy` and `deploy_time` metrics are available.

**Notes:**

- These metrics are emitted for every commit and not per deployment.
- There are several edge cases depending on the way the commits were introduced to the deployment, view the [limitations][12].

## Custom Dashboards
 
DORA metrics are highly flexible and can be used in custom dashboards to fit your teamâ€™s specific needs. You can also export the default dashboards available in the DORA UI and personalize them to match your workflows and visualization preferences.
