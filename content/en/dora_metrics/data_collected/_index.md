## Overview

DORA Metrics generates events that have associated tags and attributes. These events are available in the [Events Explorer][1].

You can query the metrics generated by DORA Metrics programmatically by using the [Query timeseries points][2] and [Query timeseries data across multiple products][3] API endpoints.

## Default metrics

DORA Metrics provides the following default metrics:

| Metric | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dora.deployments.count` | count | Used to calculate Deployment Frequency.
| `dora.change_lead_time` | distribution | Contains the age in `seconds` of the Git commits at the time of deployment.
| `dora.incidents_impact` | count | Tracks the services or teams impacted by incidents. Used for Change Failure Rate with the formula `dora.incidents_impact / dora.deployments.count`. A big time rollup of at least 1 week is recommended to account for the time difference between deployments and when the impact starts.
| `dora.time_to_restore` | distribution | Contains the time in `seconds` between the incident's `started_at` and `finished_at`.

### Default tags

All default metrics contain the following tags if any are available:

- `service`
- `team`
- `env`
- `repository_id`

**Note**: The `severity` tag is available for `dora.incidents_impact` and `dora.time_to_restore` metrics, if it is provided through the DORA Metrics API.

For more information about using reserved `env`, `service`, and `version` tags, see [Unified Service Tagging][6].
