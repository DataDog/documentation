1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.540
Esther Kim: Okay, you're good.

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:18.880
Alex Flinois: Cool, okay, so basically, when I'm here, the remediation today that we pitch is like, oh, like, if you've seen this problem before, you probably codified it in a workflow, that you can just kind of run, and so you can imagine, I think we have one that's… we use a dash.

3
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.800
Alex Flinois: Yeah, which is like a service restart. And so you could imagine that, like, okay,

4
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:38.029
Alex Flinois: I have a workflow, I just need to give it the service, and then I can run it, and it'll restart it, and so I can put out the fire quickly. And so that's what I really… I meant by remediation, and just talk about this button, and what it can do, and why it's useful. We're actually going to move this button in here.

5
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:51.219
Alex Flinois: Similarly to how for automations you have here… notifications you have here, and page you have here, and the reason for it is, basically, here you have all your automations that are triggered automatically, but the idea is, like.

6
00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:02.139
Alex Flinois: this run workflow is basically running on automation manually, and so we're just going to move that button there, and so I wonder if we just want to talk about that in the… within automations themselves.

7
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.649
Esther Kim: Yeah, I think… I think we can put… leave it there, then.

8
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.700
Esther Kim: If it's going to move into automations, like mentioned.

9
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.900
Esther Kim: What about, what about the actual remediation tab?

10
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.320
Esther Kim: Is that documented in…

11
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:34.530
Alex Flinois: So we're doing a few things on the UI that we're changing. I want to show you what we're doing there. So… It's gonna take a while to get there, but maybe our prioritization on the documentation side should just take that into consideration.

12
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:50.989
Alex Flinois: So this is kind of the new UI that we're gonna work on, and you can see there's three things. There's, like, live details, which is the live incident you're running, post incidents, and automations. Automations will basically include notifications and automation together, and they'll just be one thing, which will look the same.

13
00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:01.639
Alex Flinois: Post-incident, which, we haven't built… we haven't added to this, prototype, but I can show you what it looks like as well. I might actually have it in…

14
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.340
Alex Flinois: Here, because I just showed it to a customer.

15
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.850
Alex Flinois: Currently… You can't see that good, let me just… Pa-dum… Where is it? Okay, cool.

16
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.279
Alex Flinois: This is what the post-incident would look like. So, basically, you have an embedded post-mortem.

17
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.130
Alex Flinois: which is a notebook that you can open. You have a draft, which is a state, and then owner, and then on the right, you have the follow-ups that you can, like, create manually.

18
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.470
Alex Flinois: That's gonna be post-incident. And for live incident, you have, like, the summary, which you're familiar with, customer impact, which you're familiar with.

19
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:53.699
Alex Flinois: this, like, response team, which is supposed to be, like, a live updating based on what we know people are doing, and on the right is, like, this dynamic plan, which is, like, a combination of what the agents are doing, what the humans are doing. And then you have, like, your typical properties view.

20
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.150
Alex Flinois: And then, yeah, we've decluttered a lot of the things.

21
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:14.709
Alex Flinois: And yeah, so this automation, which is something we've already shipped, it looks kind of different, but yeah. So that's kind of where we're heading, which is why I think, doing the remediation tab might not make that much sense, or we shouldn't call it the remediation tab. We should just call it, like, post-incident or something.

22
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.250
Alex Flinois: Maybe in the short term, we can just call it post-incidence and alleviations, and maybe that makes the most sense?

23
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.629
Esther Kim: Yeah, I think it is… I think you did already propose that, and that's in the…

24
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.420
Alex Flinois: Oh, they did? Okay, cool.

25
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:51.309
Alex Flinois: let's just call… let's consider what's on this page as post-incident, and the flows there are… basically, the incident's done, or is stable, and now you're moving into the next phase, which is generating a post-mortem. It's, you know, maybe you might link other documents, but I think that's, like, mostly not the case, and then you can create these follow-ups, which is like, okay, Esther.

26
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.490
Alex Flinois: It's gonna have to, like, document this so that it doesn't happen again, or whatever. And then you assign it to this person, whatever.

27
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.250
Alex Flinois: Yeah, so that's that.

28
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.020
Alex Flinois: Yeah.

29
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.299
Esther Kim: When… when will the new UI go GA?

30
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:18.319
Alex Flinois: It's gonna take a while. I think it's gonna… I want it to be done by Q2, so not beginning of Q2, but during the quarter of Q2. What we're doing this quarter is the post-incident, tab.

31
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:30.509
Alex Flinois: And so we're gonna tackle that first, and we're also reorganizing the settings, which is connected to what you've been working on. And a lot of the mapping just is kind of where we're heading.

32
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:44.360
Alex Flinois: towards, I can also show you designs there. So yeah, I think mid-Q2, end of Q2, we'll have the redesign of both the live incident, the post-incident, the settings, and we have this new concept called the life cycle, which is a visual representation of your process.

33
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.329
Alex Flinois: Yeah. So, yeah.

34
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.470
Esther Kim: Okay.

35
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.500
Esther Kim: A lot of paperwork.

36
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.860
Alex Flinois: Yeah, there's a lot going on. Yes.

37
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.290
Esther Kim: Yeah.

38
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:12.229
Alex Flinois: So, yeah, so… let me… do you want to share your screen again and look at what you were looking at to see what we wanted to tackle? I'm assuming that we'll iterate on it as, like, things evolve, but I think we have a good structure to start with.

39
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.340
Esther Kim: Yeah, cause this makes sense to me now.

40
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.880
Alex Flinois: Okay.

41
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:29.779
Esther Kim: If you're… if you're simplifying it for, like, the investigation, post-incident, and then automations, the structure makes a lot more sense.

42
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.420
Esther Kim: And I also appreciate that you kind of gave me, like.

43
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.359
Esther Kim: A purpose for why we need to do this.

44
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.779
Esther Kim: Setup and configuration… Then I guess this…

45
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.299
Esther Kim: Oh, this is right, you wanted… you wanted this step split out.

46
00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:02.970
Alex Flinois: Yeah, so scroll back up, what section are we in? Yeah, so let's look at the setup redesign, which we're gonna build this quarter, so you get an idea of where we're going.

47
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.580
Esther Kim: Okay.

48
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:18.189
Alex Flinois: So they were doing two things on the setting. One is an onboarding page, and the other one is, like, the settings. So today we have an onboarding page, which looks like it was built in the 90s, and so we're trying to, like, update that, and then the other piece is, like,

49
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:30.119
Alex Flinois: So there's, like, a welcome screen today, which is, like, yellow, and then there's, like, nothing. You arrive in settings, and so one of the things we're building is, basically a simple screen.

50
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.780
Alex Flinois: Single page that just, pushes the user to set up the things that are the most important.

51
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:51.560
Alex Flinois: to just test an incident, and which is basically set up Slack and connect, like, your Zoom. And once they've done that, and from our opinion, they could use opinion default with everything else, and it would work pretty well. And so, that's what we're building right now, and so it should be live pretty soon.

52
00:06:51.800 --> 00:07:05.339
Alex Flinois: This is the ugly thing I don't like, but we are keeping it for now, so we have some logic of where people land. And then the other piece is, like, we're reorganizing settings. I can show you this thing afterwards, by the way, so you can take a look on your own time.

53
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.940
Alex Flinois: Yeah, so we're changing the organization, so today it kind of looks like this.

54
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.880
Esther Kim: Yeah.

55
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:21.930
Alex Flinois: And we're changing it to look like this. And so, on the left, you have a drop-down for your instant types, so you don't have anything being polluted, and so you could do a little drop-down and look at other instant types if you have many.

56
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:35.040
Alex Flinois: And then it follows the customer journey, so you have, like, define, coordination, post instance, and settings. And then… so the things that you already know about, like, information, property fields, integrations will be there.

57
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:52.300
Alex Flinois: Coordination is about automation, so some that you've already done. Chat and video are just going to be pulling out the integrations for chat and video, since they're so primary there, and have a view specifically for them. And then post-incident will be post-mortems and follow-ups, which will include, the templates, as well as the settings.

58
00:07:52.490 --> 00:08:00.399
Alex Flinois: And then automations also has notifications, and then analytics will live here. And so, yeah, this is something we're building as well this quarter.

59
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.620
Esther Kim: And is incidents under… or, sorry, integrations under that? Okay, yeah, it is.

60
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:15.489
Alex Flinois: So yeah, yeah, so integration is here. And then the thing, the new thing we're introducing is this concept of a life cycle, which is basically supposed to…

61
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:23.220
Alex Flinois: Represent a visual view of all the settings together and how they work when the incident transitions from one state to another.

62
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:40.319
Alex Flinois: And so, the experience… I think they've changed the design a little bit, but it kind of looks like this, where you filter it by a severity, and you can add other conditions, and then it'll show you how things work, and then you can click on, like, okay, what automations are fired, both the ones you've created and are, like, automatically created.

63
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.889
Alex Flinois: And it's supposed to give the customer the ability to have a view

64
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:55.119
Alex Flinois: of everything in one place, and simplified. So that, we're probably gonna start building in Q2. We're trying to finalize the design now. Yeah, so that, that's, that's basically it.

65
00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.380
Esther Kim: Okay.

66
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.910
Alex Flinois: So I could share that with you as well. I'll share all the links we talked about.

67
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.149
Alex Flinois: Cool. You wanna bring back the screen for a second? See where we are?

68
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.679
Esther Kim: That was… Setting… setup and configuration…

69
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.040
Esther Kim: And then, you had wanted new docs for testing incidents?

70
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:37.159
Alex Flinois: Yeah, so you see the new design, right? At the beginning, you do chat and video, and then there's, like, test incidents, and in general, I think we've heard and seen customers really test incidents, or want to test incidents more, but, we don't have any documentation on it, and the UI itself is a little hidden. We're gonna make that more primary, and so…

71
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:46.809
Alex Flinois: I think adding a page that's specifically about testing an incident would be useful, just looking at our existing capabilities and, you know, what the entry points are and how to use them, I think would be valuable.

72
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:53.669
Esther Kim: Is that something, you or somebody on your team can demo?

73
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.690
Esther Kim: Yeah.

74
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.049
Alex Flinois: I mean, yeah, it's pretty easy to show.

75
00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.589
Esther Kim: Oh, okay.

76
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.189
Alex Flinois: I could show you.

77
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.510
Alex Flinois: No.

78
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:09.339
Alex Flinois: So, I mean, basically, a test incident is really just an incident, it just doesn't affect your data.

79
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.190
Alex Flinois: So, if I go to an incident, you have to choose, like, a…

80
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.819
Alex Flinois: Like, here, drop down, declare a test incident.

81
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.810
Alex Flinois: And so now I'm in the test instance, and… should I call it Esther Test.

82
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.809
Alex Flinois: And then you can decide the type. I'm gonna choose my thing for…

83
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.050
Alex Flinois: Oh, am I in prod? I'm in prod, I'm not doing that.

84
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.550
Alex Flinois: No, I'm not impressed. Where is my…

85
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.989
Alex Flinois: Or maybe I didn't enable test instance.

86
00:10:45.170 --> 00:11:00.329
Alex Flinois: Yeah, I guess it's a setting you have to turn on, because it's clearly not a thing here. Okay, so I put the type of incident, I can do whatever it is, I can put all the information, and then here, you can see I can decide if it's, like, gonna execute the integrations, or notification rules, or analytics, or anything.

87
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:08.010
Alex Flinois: I can decide if it's private or not, and then I can just hit the clear incident, and then it'll just say it's a test incident, but then I can just kind of play with it.

88
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:13.379
Alex Flinois: And change everything, and kind of see how the experience will change and work.

89
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:26.160
Alex Flinois: And so, I mean, that's basically it. Like, it's there for you to test things without breaking things, or triggering, integrations, or bothering people if you don't want to, and see how it works.

90
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.589
Alex Flinois: So, yeah, I mean, that's basically it.

91
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.650
Esther Kim: For the docs, this is just to help customers

92
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.649
Esther Kim: Understand how it works, or, like, bring it to light that they can do this.

93
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:52.129
Alex Flinois: Yeah, or also give them an idea, and this is where I think Chris might be useful, because the feature predates me, of, like, how people should use it. I've heard customers want to use it, but sometimes, like, you know, they run into gaps.

94
00:11:52.130 --> 00:12:00.490
Alex Flinois: And so, I think just, yeah, both the best practice, like a guide, I guess, which is what you've done, and of, like, the configuration.

95
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:09.489
Alex Flinois: I'm looking now, but I'm assuming that there is something in the settings that allows me to enable testing settings. I'm just looking at mine.

96
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.390
Alex Flinois: Okay, I'll just do it with you, because we're recording.

97
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:19.150
Alex Flinois: So I'm just in my incident type here, test insidency, there's a setting.

98
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.190
Esther Kim: Got it.

99
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.060
Alex Flinois: Now I can test this type of incident.

100
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.110
Alex Flinois: Yeah.

101
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.120
Alex Flinois: So I think, that would be…

102
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.320
Alex Flinois: Yeah, let me see the organization…

103
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.180
Alex Flinois: What's the name of the dock that you were looking at?

104
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.760
Alex Flinois: Citizens.

105
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.460
Esther Kim: Which one?

106
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.439
Alex Flinois: They're the one that you're sharing.

107
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.409
Esther Kim: Oh, I'm sorry, it's called Technical Documentation Reorg Plan. I can send it to you.

108
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.959
Alex Flinois: No worries, Darry, I'll find it.

109
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.599
Esther Kim: If you got it, yeah.

110
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.679
Alex Flinois: Okay, cool, yeah, just so we don't have to, like, keep changing.

111
00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:07.809
Alex Flinois: Yeah, so test an incident… we put it… I guess it's under setup, right? Yeah, because I do think it's a setup feature. You're trying… you add a new feature, and you test it, and you want to see how it works. I think that's how people would use it?

112
00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:18.029
Alex Flinois: So yeah, so this is, like, the live incident view, Claire described, whatever, whatever, how to use AI during it, which is great, getting started, configurations…

113
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.149
Alex Flinois: And post-incident, yeah.

114
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:36.150
Alex Flinois: Cool. Yeah, I think one thing that we might want to do… let's set this up. I think we might want, like, an AI piece. I think people had a lot of questions about, like, where do I set up AI? So maybe in the UI, we need to make that better. Maybe there's an AI entry, but, like, the AI stuff is, like, kind of in different places.

115
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.829
Alex Flinois: But yeah, I think for now, this looks pretty good. Do you have any other questions on it?

116
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:50.379
Esther Kim: Oh, let me see… You had a comment about adding on call-to integrations?

117
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.569
Alex Flinois: Yeah, so one of the… oh yeah, I think you asked me about this.

118
00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.350
Alex Flinois: I've actually never done it myself, but I've seen it, and so in…

119
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.459
Alex Flinois: We're on call here

120
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.989
Alex Flinois: So I guess this is more of a setting than, like, an integration, honestly. Should probably move it somewhere else, now that I see it.

121
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:28.679
Alex Flinois: And so if I do this, when you basically page from the incident, or escalate from a page, then it will be connected to an incident, and so then it would auto-resolve it.

122
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:35.029
Alex Flinois: But that feels like it should be… not here. Integrations, to me, is third-party integrations.

123
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.870
Alex Flinois: And then this is, status pages, so you can create…

124
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:45.160
Alex Flinois: status page updates from incidents, so I think these two should be somewhere else, in my opinion.

125
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.230
Alex Flinois: Yeah, that's what I meant.

126
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.469
Esther Kim: Okay, I think,

127
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:04.969
Esther Kim: I think we covered everything. For the… so for now, for the remediation ask, we're just gonna table that.

128
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.890
Esther Kim: Until the reorg happens.

129
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.200
Alex Flinois: I think what you can probably do…

130
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.460
Alex Flinois: Is we can maybe, in the index of post-incidence, or maybe… let me see…

131
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.579
Alex Flinois: Where did I suggest we put it? Or maybe in here?

132
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:26.189
Alex Flinois: Describe, response, investigate. Maybe there's… it could be an entry here around, like.

133
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:44.139
Alex Flinois: things that you can do, because I think you can send a notification, will probably be a notification. There's… you can page people, which is maybe related to response team, and the thing that we don't have is that you can trigger a workflow, and so maybe there's an entry here that is related to that. We could maybe call it remediation,

134
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.299
Alex Flinois: Or maybe we just call it automation.

135
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.800
Esther Kim: Do you want me to add a new section there versus adding it into automations and notifications?

136
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.850
Alex Flinois: Yeah, I think we can maybe, like, add it here,

137
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:06.859
Alex Flinois: I wonder if what we want to do is just… because to me, like, the job to be done is the same if I am paging

138
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:24.439
Alex Flinois: if I am, notifying, like, these three things, the manual version is kind of the same. Like, here's like, okay, I need somebody else, let me page them. Okay, I need to notify Esther, let me do it. And then this is, like, okay, I want to, like, remediate an issue, there's a button here to do it.

139
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:32.640
Alex Flinois: And so, maybe we put these three sections together, yo.

140
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.480
Alex Flinois: Yeah, because you have…

141
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:44.230
Alex Flinois: The other thing we could do is, like, put the paging response team and notifications in one section.

142
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.809
Alex Flinois: And put automation in another one, because the automation is usually trying to…

143
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:54.349
Alex Flinois: I mean, we're assuming it's a remediation, I guess, but it could be more than that.

144
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.760
Alex Flinois: Kind of thinking out loud right now, but… .

145
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.060
Esther Kim: Basically, you want whoever's coming to the docs to know

146
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:14.619
Esther Kim: This is how you work within an incident, and then, like, the steps to do it, to notify the people, to investigate, and then describe it.

147
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:27.380
Alex Flinois: Yeah. As I'm thinking about it, I'm just gonna put a suggestion, is I think, we want, like, a remediation MD, or maybe it's not a page itself, but I think we want to align, like, triggering a workflow

148
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:39.980
Alex Flinois: manually, here, because this is a story we want to tell, and then I wonder if, like, these things could be… also include…

149
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.739
Alex Flinois: Paging some, a teen or person?

150
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:59.429
Alex Flinois: so it's like, I want to notify… Include… Or wake up.

151
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.839
Alex Flinois: Just paging, someone.

152
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.759
Alex Flinois: That's the… that's the job to be done for these things.

153
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.149
Alex Flinois: Yeah, that's my thought.

154
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.500
Esther Kim: Okay.

155
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.719
Esther Kim: Cool. Yep, that makes sense.

156
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.930
Alex Flinois: While we're… is there anything else on this that you need from me? Are you good? Cool.

157
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.320
Esther Kim: Good.

158
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:31.319
Alex Flinois: There's one thing that, has come up a few times that I want to demo to you, and I do think that we want to document it, which is specifically on the…

159
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:41.970
Alex Flinois: post-mortem, or it, sorry, the follow-ups. So specifically, I'll literally just paste the, what this person asked me.

160
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:48.450
Alex Flinois: And so you can take a look, so I… It's the thing, okay.

161
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.330
Alex Flinois: We're gonna look at this Slack together.

162
00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.120
Alex Flinois: Cool. Did not load, okay. Open in the browser.

163
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:20.069
Alex Flinois: Okay, so this person, is a sales engineer, and he's saying, hey Alex, does incident management do bi-directional syncing, or is it just case management? What's the best way to do it? And so I gave him this answer, which I can forward you, but basically here, there's, like, multiple things he's asking about. He's asking about the Jira integration.

164
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:27.370
Alex Flinois: Which, in our documentation, is, like, extremely light, I was checking. And then, he's also asking about,

165
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.700
Alex Flinois: you know.

166
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:41.619
Alex Flinois: follow-ups, or the incident level, and it's something that keeps coming up, and he talks about by singing him. So, specifically, in incident management, there's two different ways to think about it. One is at the incident level.

167
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:56.520
Alex Flinois: Do I want to push that to Jira, and does that want to be u-directional or bi-directional, right? Today, in the integration section, you can set up at the instant level if it's unidirectional.

168
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.359
Alex Flinois: And we're trying to make that bidirectional this quarter.

169
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.919
Alex Flinois: But that's, like, not super clear. The second piece is follow-ups themselves.

170
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:12.220
Alex Flinois: can also be connected to Jira, and by default, if you use the,

171
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:18.050
Alex Flinois: If you use the settings that exist by default… let's go back to this…

172
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:25.949
Alex Flinois: If you're, you know, you'll just assume Jira is the right option, but this is actually only unidirectional.

173
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:38.549
Alex Flinois: Case management allows you to do bidirectional, but that's, like, super unclear to the customer, and that's something we're trying to improve, but I think in the short term, we can make that clear in the documentation. And so, I think the ask is…

174
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.439
Alex Flinois: Maybe threefold, which is, like…

175
00:20:41.660 --> 00:21:01.329
Alex Flinois: is there something we could do specifically on the JIRA integration? And that section covers the fact that with Jira, you can touch things at the instant level, at the follow-up level, and then, you know, the nuances of unidirectional and bidirectional, and, like, the features that exist that don't exist. That's, like, maybe one ask. And the other one is

176
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:10.719
Alex Flinois: refer to this, or, like, in the follow-up section, mention the different types of templates that exist, and how case management can give you bidirectionality.

177
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:28.890
Alex Flinois: And then, yeah, and the incident settings may point to the integration. I'm not sure exactly how everything's gotta connect, but telling this story so a customer who wants to basically set up JIRA integration, have it, like, very clear, today, we just… the UI is not good enough, that's why bridging the gap with docs, I think, makes sense in the short term.

178
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.890
Alex Flinois: that's it, yeah.

179
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.410
Esther Kim: Yeah, if you wouldn't mind just sending that to me, I can…

180
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.400
Alex Flinois: Very cool.

181
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.490
Alex Flinois: I will review everything, so…

182
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.120
Alex Flinois: Cool.

183
00:21:59.340 --> 00:21:59.970
Esther Kim: Yep.

184
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:11.229
Alex Flinois: Yeah, there's other things that the team has done, which I don't know if you were involved, but there… we added this page on instant response billing. Did you see that?

185
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.960
Esther Kim: No, but I also… Docs doesn't usually cover billing unless it's, like.

186
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.839
Alex Flinois: Yeah, I just want to make sure you're aware.

187
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.510
Esther Kim: Okay.

188
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:31.110
Alex Flinois: this, you can decide to not do anything about it, but, so in Instant Management, I think it's, like, connected at the end.

189
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:54.009
Alex Flinois: Here, it's here. Okay, so we have this page, which is an instant response, under account management, I guess, and in there it talks about, like, billing, and so I don't know if we want to make that more explicit somewhere, but it is a page that I send to sales rep and customers 5 to 6 times a week.

190
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.400
Alex Flinois: Yeah. And so…

191
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.249
Alex Flinois: Something to think about when you think about the structure of the docs, if that should be more primary or not.

192
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.110
Esther Kim: Yeah.

193
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.210
Esther Kim: Okay.

194
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.380
Esther Kim: I will take a look.

195
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.000
Alex Flinois: But…

196
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.510
Esther Kim: Yeah, but thanks… thanks for outlining all of that for me. Makes it easier.

197
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.509
Alex Flinois: 100%, yeah, thanks for, being proactive and…

198
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:26.529
Alex Flinois: Getting the call set up. Looking forward to keep chatting, happy to do async or more meetings as needed.

199
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.970
Esther Kim: Sounds good. Thank you, Alex.

200
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:29.680
Alex Flinois: Hi, Esther.

201
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.300
Esther Kim: Right.
