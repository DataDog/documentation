## Overview

Test runs appear in a test details page after a Synthetic test executes. [Sample results](#sample-results) correlate to the latest passed and failed test executions over a time interval and in a specific number of locations and devices.

## Test properties

In the **Properties** section, you can see the test ID, test creation and edit dates, test priority, environment tag, and additional tags.

**Overview** 
: This section describes the test on which mobile application, version, location, number of devices, test interval, and the number of test steps.

**Monitor**
: This section contains the name of the [Synthetic test's monitor][1] and the configured notification message.

**CI/CD Execution**
: This section contains a dropdown menu to change the [execution rule][2] for this test running as part of a [CI pipeline][3].

## Test history

In the **History** section, you can see three graphs:

- The **Global Uptime** graph displays the total uptime of all test locations in a given time interval. The global uptime takes into consideration the [alert conditions][4] configured for a test.
- The **Time-to-interactive by location and device** graph displays the amount of time until a page can be interacted with in seconds. For more information about uptime monitoring, see the [Website Uptime Monitoring with SLOs][5] guide.
- The **Test duration by location and device** graph displays the amount of time in minutes each location and device takes to complete in a given time interval.

## Sample results

Mobile test runs include components such as [screenshots](#screenshots-and-actions), [errors](#errors-and-warnings), and [resources](#resources) to help troubleshoot your [test failure](#failed-results).

In the **Sample Runs** section, you can examine the latest failed test runs and compare them to recent successful test runs.

### Overview attributes

Status
: The status of your test run (`PASSED` or `FAILED`).

Starting URL
: The URL of your mobile test scenario.

Steps
: The number of test steps completed in your sample run.

Duration
: The amount of time it took your test to run.

Location
: The managed or private location your test was executed from.

Device
: The type of device your test was executed from.

Browser
: The type of browser your test was executed from.

Time ran
: The amount of time that has passed since your test ran.

Run type
: The type of test run (CI, fast retry, manually triggered, or scheduled).

### Screenshots and actions

Every executed test step contains a screenshot of the step action, the step description, starting URL for a given step, step ID, and step duration.

## Failed results

A test result is considered `FAILED` if it does not satisfy its assertions or if a step failed for another reason. You can troubleshoot failed runs by looking at their screenshots, checking for potential [errors](#errors-and-warnings) at the step level, and looking into [resources][7] generated by their steps.

Common mobile test errors include:

`Element located but it's invisible` 
: The element is on the page but cannot be clicked onâ€”for instance, if another element is overlaid on top of it.

`Cannot locate element`
: The element cannot be found in the HTML.

`Select did not have option`
: The specified option is missing from the dropdown menu.

`Forbidden URL`
: The test likely encountered a protocol that is not supported. [Contact Support][6] for more details.

`General test failure`
: A general error message. [Contact Support][6] for more details.

## Test events

Alerts from your Synthetic test monitors appear in the **Events** tab under **Test Runs**. To search for alerts from Synthetic tests in the Events Explorer, navigate to [**Events** > **Explorer**][18] and enter `Event Type:synthetics_alert` in the search query. For more information, see [Using Synthetic Test Monitors][1].
