## Overview

Event-based SLOs are useful for a count-based stream of data where you are differentiating good and bad events. 
There is one type of event-based SLO - a metric query SLO. A metric query uses the sum of the good events divided by the sum of total events over time to calculate a Service Level Indicator (or SLI).

## Setup

On the [SLO status page][1], select **New SLO +**. Then select [**Event**][2].

### Configuration

#### Define queries

There are two queries to define. The first query defines the sum of the good events, while the second query defines the sum of
the total events.

Datadog recommends the `sum by` aggregator and to add all events.

**Example:** If you are tracking HTTP return codes, and your metric includes a tag like `code:2xx` || `code:3xx` || `code:4xx`.
The sum of good events would be `sum:httpservice.hits{code:2xx} + sum:httpservice.hits{code:4xx}`. And the `total` events
would be `sum:httpservice.hits{!code:3xx}`. 

Why did we exclude `HTTP 3xx`? - These are typically redirects and should not count for or against the SLI, but other non 3xx
based error codes should. In the `total` case we want all types minus `HTTP 3xx`, in the `numerator` we only want `OK` type
status codes.

#### Set your targets

SLO targets are the stat you use to measure uptime success.

First select your target value, example: `95% of all HTTP requests should be "good" over the last 7 days`.

You can optionally include a warning value that is greater than the target value to indicate when you are approaching
an SLO breach.

#### Identify the indicator

Here we add contextual information about the purpose of the SLO, including any related information
in the description and tags you would like to associate with the SLO.
