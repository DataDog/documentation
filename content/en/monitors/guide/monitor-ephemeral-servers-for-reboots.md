Ephemeral environments spin up and terminate hosts constantly, which can make it challenging to distinguish new hosts from rebooted hosts.

You can use a metric monitor on the `system.uptime` metric can to address this. The uptime metric is an ever increasing timer which resets to 0 when a host boots up. You can use the `diff()` function with the metric to distinguish between a new server, which has an uptime of 0 (new server), and a rebooted server, which will show a change (diff) from a running uptime value to a 0.

The example shown below captures how you can set this up:
