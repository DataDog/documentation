In some cases, you would like to know when one of your tags disappears from some of your systems. It is possible to set up a [monitor][1] for such an alert scheme within Datadog:

1. Set up a classic [metric monitor][2], and specify the metric and tag that you want to be alerted on when it is missing.
1. Select an alert condition that could never be triggered. For example, `a < -1` for a positive metric such as `system.cpu.user`.
1. Activate the _Notify if data is missing_ option, as you can see on this example:

{{< img src="monitors/guide/tag_stop_reporting.png" alt="Tag stop reporting"  >}}

Your alert triggers if the tag stops reporting.
