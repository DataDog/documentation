When you [schedule a downtime][1] over a specific tag scope, the downtime will apply "AND" logic to those tags. So if you wanted to set up a downtime over `host:A` and `host:B`, then the downtime will silence only those monitors that alert on evaluation groups that contain both tags **`host:A` AND `host:B`** (and such a downtime would likely not silence any alerts).

If you want to schedule a downtime over a subset of hosts, a good way to do so is to find a host-tag common to all those hosts and scope the downtime by that tag.

One way you can take advantage of this is to create new host-tags directly in the Datadog UI from your [Infrastructure List][2] and [Host Map][3] by selecting a host and hitting the **Edit Tags** button (shown below), or with the [Datadog API][4].
