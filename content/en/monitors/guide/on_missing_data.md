## Overview

Metric Monitors offer enhanced options for handling missing data, allowing you to differentiate between missing data as a failure mode and a healthy state. 

These options align with what's available in other monitors types like CI, Database, Error Tracking, and more. They apply to query-based monitors, including Integration and Anomaly monitors, providing two main configurations based on the aggregation type:

## Benefits of using On Missing Data options

Metric Monitors tracking errors should reflect as "OK" when no errors occur. With the legacy No Data configurations, monitors would raise alerts with missing data, leading to confusion and workarounds. The On Missing Data configuration options allow monitors to reflect health states, eliminating the need for workarounds.

## Monitors managed through the UI

If you manage your monitors from the UI, they are automatically updated for you. If you'd like to update them sooner, you can do it through the API as explained below.

## Monitors managed through the API or Terraform

If you are managing your monitors with API or Terraform, replace `notify_no_data` and `no_data_timeframe` with `on_missing_data`. The `no_data_timeframe` parameter is not required since `on_missing_data` uses the same time frame as the time window.  
The available values for `on_missing_data` are:

* default  
* show_no_data  
* show_and_notify_no_data  
* resolve

### API parameters

The previous No Data parameter, `notify_no_data`, remains available on existing monitors and are not automatically upgraded to the new `on_missing_data` features.

| Parameter                               | UI Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"on_missing_data": "show_and_notify_no_data"` | If data is missing Show NO DATA and notify<br>(Formerly, "Notify if data is missing")                       |
| `"on_missing_data": "show_no_data"`     | If data is missing Show NO DATA<br>(Formerly, "Do not notify if data is missing")                           |
| `"on_missing_data": "resolve"`          | If data is missing Show OK                                                                       |
| `"on_missing_data": "default"` if using sum or count aggregation | If data is missing Evaluate as 0 (or other default value)                                  |
| `"on_missing_data": "default"` if using all other aggregation types | If data is missing Show last known status |

For all the available fields, see the [API Documentation][1].

Here's an example of before and after of a JSON monitor with those fields:

**Before**  
```json
{  
  "name": "CPU usage is high for host $host.value",  
    "type": "query alert",  
    "query": "avg(last_5m):100 - avg:system.cpu.idle{$host} > 90",  
    "message": "A high CPU usage has been detected for host $host.value, which can impact the system performance.",  
    "tags": [],  
    "options": {  
        "thresholds": { "critical": 90 },  
        "notify_audit": false,  
        "include_tags": false,  
        "notify_no_data": true,  
        "no_data_timeframe": 10  
    }  
}
```

**After**  
{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=11" >}}{
  "name": "CPU usage is high for host $host.value",  
    "type": "query alert",  
    "query": "avg(last_5m):100 - avg:system.cpu.idle{$host} > 90",  
    "message": "A high CPU usage has been detected for host $host.value, which can impact the system performance.",  
    "tags": [],  
    "options": {  
       "thresholds": { "critical": 90 },  
       "notify_audit": false,  
       "include_tags": false,  
       "on_missing_data": "show_and_notify_no_data"  
    }  
}

## SLO monitors

SLOs treat uptime and downtime according to this mapping:

| On Missing Data Configuration | Monitor Status                 | SLO Treatment               |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Show OK                       | OK                             | Uptime                      |
| Show No Data                  | No Data                        | Uptime                      |
| Show No Data and Notify       | No Data                        | Downtime                    |
| Show last known status        | Whatever the last status was   | If OK, Uptime<br>If Alert, Downtime |
| Evaluate as zero              | Depends on the threshold configuration | If OK, Uptime<br>If Alert, Downtime |
