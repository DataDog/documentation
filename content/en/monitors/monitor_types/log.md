## Overview

Once [log management is enabled][1] for your organization, you can create a logs monitor to alert you when a specified type of log exceeds a user-defined threshold over a given period of time.

## Monitor creation

To create a [logs monitor][2] in Datadog, use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Logs*.

### Define the search query

As you define the search query, the graph above the search fields updates.

1. If you have [multiple log indexes][3], select the index to search.
2. Construct a search query using the same logic as a [log explorer search][4].
3. Choose to monitor over a log count, [facet][5], or [measure][5]:
    * **Monitor over a log count**: Use the search bar (optional) and do **not** select a facet or measure. Datadog evaluates the number of logs over a selected time frame, then compares it to the threshold conditions.
    * **Monitor over a facet**: If a [facet][5] is selected, the monitor alerts over the `Unique value count` of the facet.
    * **Monitor over measure**: If a [measure][5] is selected, the monitor alerts over the numerical value of the log facet (similar to a metric monitor) and aggregation needs to be selected (`min`, `avg`, `sum`, `median`, `pc75`, `pc90`, `pc95`, `pc98`, `pc99`, or `max`).
4. Define the alert grouping (optional). **Note**: With or without alert grouping defined, you get **one** alert when the aggregated value meets the set conditions. Even if you split the query by host, a single notification is sent if several hosts meet the set conditions. This is done to reduce notification noise.

### Set alert conditions

* Trigger when the metric is `above`, `above or equal to`, `below`, or `below or equal to`
* the threshold during the last `5 minutes`, `15 minutes`, `1 hour`, etc.
* Alert threshold `<NUMBER>`
* Warning threshold `<NUMBER>`

#### No data and below alerts

To receive a notification when all groups in a service have stopped sending logs, set the condition to `below 1`. This notifies when no logs match the monitor query in a given timeframe across all aggregate groups.

When splitting the monitor by any dimension (tag or facet) and using a `below` condition, the alert is triggered **if and only if** there are logs for a given group, and the count is below the thresholdâ€”or if there are no logs for **all** of the groups.

**Examples**:

* This monitor triggers if and only if there are no logs for all services:

* This monitor triggers if there are no logs for the service `backend`:

### Notifications

For detailed instructions on the **Say what's happening** and **Notify your team** sections, see the [Notifications][6] page.

#### Log samples

By default, when a logs monitor is triggered, samples or values are added to the notification message.

| Monitor over     | Added to notification message                                                                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Log count        | Grouped: The top 10 breaching values and their corresponding counts.<br>Ungrouped: Up to 10 log samples. |
| Facet or measure | The top 10 facet or measure values.                                                                      |

These are available for notifications sent to Slack, Jira, webhooks, Microsoft Teams, Pagerduty, and email. **Note**: Samples are not displayed for recovery notifications.

To disable log samples, uncheck the box at the bottom of the **Say what's happening** section. The text next to the box is based on your monitor's grouping (as stated above).

#### Examples

Include a table of the top 10 breaching values:
{{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/log/top_10_breaching_values.png" alt="Top 10 breaching values"  style="width:60%;" >}}

Include a sample of 10 logs in the alert notification:
{{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/log/10_sample_logs.png" alt="Top 10 breaching values"  style="width:60%;" >}}
