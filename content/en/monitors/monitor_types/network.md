## Overview

Network monitors cover the TCP and HTTP checks available in the Agent. For details on Agent configuration, see the [HTTP check][1] or [TCP check][2] documentation.

## Monitor creation

To create a [network monitor][3] in Datadog, use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Network*.

### Network status

#### Pick a check

* Choose a network check type (`ssl`, `http`, or `tcp`).
* Choose a specific endpoint or `All monitored <TYPE> endpoints`.

#### Pick monitor scope

Select the scope to monitor by choosing host names, tags, or choose `All Monitored Hosts`. If you need to exclude certain hosts, use the second field to list names or tags.

* The include field uses `AND` logic. All listed hostnames and tags must be present on a host for it to be included.
* The exclude field uses `OR` logic. Any host with a listed hostname or tag is excluded.

#### Set alert conditions

In this section, choose between a **Check Alert** or **Cluster Alert**:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Check Alert" %}}

A check alert tracks consecutive statuses submitted per check grouping and compares it to your thresholds.

Set up the check alert:

1. Trigger a separate alert for each `<GROUP>` reporting your check.

    Check grouping is specified either from a list of known groupings or by you. For network monitors, the per-check grouping is explicitly known. For example, the HTTP check is tagged with `host`, `instance`, and `url`.

2. Trigger the alert after selected consecutive failures: `<NUMBER>`

    Each check run submits a single status of `OK`, `WARN`, or `CRITICAL`. Choose how many consecutive runs with the `CRITICAL` status trigger a notification. For example, your HTTP check might have a single blip where the connection fails. If you set this value to `> 1`, the blip is ignored, but a problem with more than one consecutive failure triggers a notification.

3. Resolve the alert after selected consecutive successes: `<NUMBER>`

    Choose how many consecutive runs with the `OK` status resolve the alert.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Cluster Alert" %}}

A cluster alert calculates the percent of checks in a given status and compares it to your thresholds.

Set up a cluster alert:

1. Decide whether or not to group your checks according to a tag. `Ungrouped` calculates the status percentage across all sources. `Grouped` calculates the status percentage on a per-group basis.

2. Select the percentage for the alert threshold.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

See the [metric monitor][4] documentation for information on [No data][5], [Auto resolve][6], and [Evaluation delay][7] options.

#### Notifications

For detailed instructions on the **Say what's happening** and **Notify your team** sections, see the [Notifications][8] page.

### Network metric

Create a network metric monitor by following the instructions in the [metric monitor][8] documentation. Using the network metric monitor type ensures the monitor can be selected by the network monitor type facet on the [Manage Monitors][9] page.
