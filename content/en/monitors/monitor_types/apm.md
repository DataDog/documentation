## Overview

These work just like regular [metric monitors][1] - but with controls tailored specifically to APM metrics. They allow you to alert at the service level on hits, errors, and a variety of latency measures.

## Setup

1. Select your monitor scopeâ€”[environment][2], [service][3], and [resource][4]:
    {{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/apm/apm_select_scope.png" alt="APM select Scope" responsive="true" style="width:75%;" >}}
2. Set your alert conditions:
    {{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/apm/apm_set_alert_conditions.png" alt="APM set alert conditions" responsive="true" style="width:75%;" >}}
3. Configure your **notification options**:
    Refer to the [Notifications][5] dedicated documentation page for detailed options.

**Note**: Find service level monitors on the [Services page][6] and on the [Service Map][7], and find resource level monitors on the individual Resource pages (you can get there by clicking on the specific Resource listed on the [Services page][6]).
