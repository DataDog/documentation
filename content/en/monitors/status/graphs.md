<div class="alert alert-info">Status Graphs is part of the <a href="/monitors/status/status_page">provisional monitor status page</a>. If you are using the legacy status page, see the <a href="/monitors/status/status_legacy">Status Page (Legacy)</a> documentation.</div>

## Overview

The graphs on the monitor status page provide insights into the single monitor evaluations. These graphs help you to understand why your monitor might be in an `ALERT` state and where to focus your troubleshooting efforts.

## Monitor metadata

{{< img src="/monitors/status/graphs/status_graph_metadata.png" alt="Monitor metadata section on the right side of the status page." style="width:100%;" >}}

The right panel of the graph section of the monitor status page provides a high-level overview of your monitor, including

|  | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Groups | Count of groups per status (`ALERT`, `WARN`, `NO DATA`, `OK`) |
| Visualize as | Graph selector to toggle between the Evaluated Data, Source Data, and Transitions graphs. |
| Query | The raw monitor query. Each monitor includes a dynamic link to a specific explorer or page based on the data type, such as event explorer for event data types or a general metric explorer for other types. |
| Evaluation | The aggregation method applied to the Query with the evaluation window. |
| Notification count | Count of notifications sent from this monitor. |


## Filter the page by groups or status

Depending on the query, the monitor might have multiple groups. To focus on a specific group, use the filter dropdowns to select the desired group.

{{< img src="/monitors/status/view_monitor_evaluations_graphs_1.png" alt="Example monitor status page filtered by a template variable" style="width:100%;" >}}

You can choose to scope the page on:

Group status
: Only groups that are currently in the selected state will be shown.

Muted state
: Only groups that are muted, or not, will be shown.

Group names
: Only groups that have the selected tag will be shown.

## Evaluated data graph

The evaluated data visualization is specific to the monitor and shows the results of individual evaluations. For example, if the monitor evaluates the average over the last 5 minutes, each data point represents the aggregated 5 minute average at each evaluation time.

The visualization matches your monitor's configuration to show the monitor's historical and current status using evaluations settings. The graphs show the status by group.

{{< img src="/monitors/status/graphs/status_page_demo.mp4" alt="Walkthrough of Evaluated data UI features including event details and filter to group" video=true >}}

To view details on status changes (such as a change from `WARN` to `ALERT`), click the alert event on the graph and check the **Event Details** section for more information.

To filter the view for an individual group, hover over the group title and click **Filter to Group** in the tooltip.

{{< img src="/monitors/status/graphs/current_status_dot.png" alt="Evaluated data graph showing an OK graph with a WARN dot to show the current status is in WARN" style="width:100%;" >}}

When investigating past status changes, the color dot next to the group title indicates the group's current status.

### Change Tracking
The Change Tracking graph allows you to view and analyze changes related to your service and its dependencies that occurred around the same time as the alert, as such events are often the root cause of problems.

{{< img src="/monitors/status/change_tracking_monitor_status_page.png" alt="Example of a deployment shown in the monitor status page" style="width:100%;" >}}

Change Tracking supports multiple changes like deployments, feature flags or database modifications. To see the full list and setup requirements, see the [Change Tracking][2] documentation.

## Source data graph

{{< img src="/monitors/status/source_data_graph_1.png" alt="Status page displaying the source data graph" style="width:100%;" >}}

The source graph shows a view of a monitors's underlying data query as you would see in a dashboard or notebook. Use this graph to view unaltered data over time and confirm if data fluctuations or anomalies trigger alerts.

Use this graph to identify any discrepancies between raw data and expected metrics, which may indicate data collection or submission issues affecting the monitor's status.

### Restrictions of source data graph

The following monitor types are not supported by the provisional status page:

- Anomaly
- Cloud Cost
- Composite
- Database Monitoring
- Forecast
- Live Process
- Outlier
- Synthetics
- SLO Alerts
- Usage

## Transitions

The Transitions graph displays your monitor's state transitions over time, broken out by group. It shows which groups are triggering the alert.

### Non reporting

{{< img src="/monitors/status/graphs/non_reporting_transitions_1.png" alt="Transitions graph showing non reporting data" style="width:100%;" >}}

Datadog keeps monitor groups in the UI for 24 hours unless configured differently. For more information, see [Group Retention time][1]. A dotted line in the graph can indicate:

* A new group evaluated after monitor creation, shown as a dotted line from the start of the time period to when first evaluated.
* A group that has stopped reporting, then started again, with a dotted line appearing from when it dropped out to when reporting resumes.

**Note**: The non-reporting status is different from a "no data" status. Host monitors and service checks set to notify on missing data are available for 48 hours.
