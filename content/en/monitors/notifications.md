## Overview

Notifications are a key component of monitors that keep your team informed of issues and support troubleshooting. When [creating your monitor][1], add to the **Say what's happening** and **Notify your team** sections.

## Say what's happening

Use this section to set the notifications sent to your team.

### Title

Add a unique title to your monitor (required). For multi-alert monitors, some tags identifying your triggering scope are automatically inserted. Additionally, you can use [tag variables](#tag-variables).

### Message

The message field allows standard [Markdown formatting][2] and [variables](#variables). Use [conditional variables](#conditional-variables) to modulate the notification text sent to different contacts with [@notifications](#notification).

A common use-case for the monitor message is to include a step-by-step way to resolve the problem, for example:

```
Steps to free up disk space:
1. Remove unused packages
2. Clear APT cache
3. Uninstall unnecessary applications
4. Remove duplicate files
```

### Tags

Add tags to your monitor (optional). Monitor tags are different than metric tags. They are used in the UI to group and search for monitors.

### Renotify

Enable monitor renotification (optional), which is useful to remind your team a problem is not solved. If enabled, you are given the option to include an escalation message sent any time the monitor renotifies. The original notification message is also included.

## Notify your team

Use this section to send notifications to your team through email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc. You can search for team members and connected integrations with the drop-down box. When an `@notification` is added to this section, the notification is automatically added to the [message](#message) field.

**Note**: An `@notification` must have a space between it and the last line character, for example:

```
Disk space is low @ops-team@company.com
```

### @notification

`@notifications` can be sent to:

#### Email

* Notify a Datadog user by email with `@<DD_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS>`. **Note**: An email address associated with a pending Datadog user invitation is considered inactive and does not receive notifications.
* Notify any non-Datadog user by email with `@<EMAIL>`.

#### Integrations

Notify your team through connected integrations by using the format `@<INTEGRATION_NAME>-<VALUES>`. Below is a list of prefixes and example links:

| Integration    | Prefix       | Examples      |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| [Jira][3]      | `@jira`      | [Examples][4] |
| [PagerDuty][5] | `@pagerduty` | [Examples][6] |
| [Slack][7]     | `@slack`     | [Examples][7] |
| [Webhooks][8]  | `@webhook`   | [Examples][9] |


### Modifications

An [event][10] is created anytime a monitor is created, modified, silenced, or deleted. Set the `Notify` option to notify team members and chat services of these events.

### Edit restrictions

If changes are restricted, only the monitor's creator or an administrator can change the monitor. Changes include any updates to the monitor definition and muting for any amount of time.

**Note**: The limitations are applied both in the UI and API.

## Test notifications

Test notifications are supported for the [monitor types][1]: host, metric, anomaly, outlier, forecast, integration (check only), process (check only), network (check only), custom check, event, and composite.

### Run the test

1. After defining your monitor, test the notifications with the **Test Notifications** button at the bottom right of the monitor page.

2. From the test notifications pop-up, choose the monitor case to test in. You can only test states that are available in the monitorâ€™s configuration for the thresholds specified in the alerting conditions. [Recovery thresholds][11] are an exception, as Datadog sends a recovery notification once the monitor either is no longer in alert, or it has no warn conditions.

    {{< img src="monitors/notifications/test-notif-select.png" alt="Test the notifications for this monitor"  style="width:70%;" >}}

3. Click **Run Test** to send notifications to the people and services listed in the monitor.

### Events
Test notifications produce events that can be searched within the event stream. These notifications indicate who initiated the test in the message body with `[TEST]` in notification title.

### Variables

Message variables auto-populate with a randomly selected group based on the scope of your monitor's definition, for example:
```text
{{#is_alert}}
{{host.name}} <-- will populate
{{/is_alert}}
```

## Variables

### Template variables

Use template variables to customize your monitor notifications. The built-in variables are:

| Variable                      | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{value}}`                   | The value that breached the alert for metric based query monitors.           |
| `{{threshold}}`               | The value of the alert threshold set in the monitor's alert conditions.      |
| `{{warn_threshold}}`          | The value of the warning threshold set in the monitor's alert conditions.    |
| `{{ok_threshold}}`            | The value that recovered the monitor.                                        |
| `{{comparator}}`              | The relational value set in the monitor's alert conditions.                  |
| `{{last_triggered_at}}`       | The UTC date and time when the monitor last triggered.                       |
| `{{last_triggered_at_epoch}}` | The UTC date and time when the monitor last triggered in epoch milliseconds. |

#### Arithmetic

Template variables that return numerical values support arithmetic operations. To perform arithmetic on a template variable use `eval` syntax, for example:

```text
{{eval "<TEMPLATE_VARIABLE_NAME>+1-2*3/4"}}
```

Below is an example of subtracting 15 minutes from the `{{last_triggered_at_epoch}}`:

```text
{{eval "last_triggered_at_epoch-15*60*1000"}}
```

**Note**: The template variable and arithmetic expression must be wrapped in quotation marks (`"`).

### Tag variables

Tag variables can be used in multi-alert monitors based on the tags selected in the multi-alert group box. This works for any tag following the `key:value` syntax.

For example, if your monitor triggers an alert for each `host`, then the tag variables `{{host.name}}` and `{{host.ip}}` are available. To see a list of tag variables based on your tag selection, click **Use message template variables** in the **Say what's happening** section.

**Notes**:

* Variable content is escaped by default. To prevent content such as JSON or code from being escaped, use triple braces instead of double braces, for example: `{{{event.text}}}`.
* Tag variables are only populated in the text of Datadog child events. The parent event only displays an aggregation summary.

#### Tag key with period

If your tag's key has a period in it, include brackets around the full key when using a tag variable.
For example, if your tag is `dot.key.test:five` and your monitor is grouped by `dot.key.test`, use:

```text
{{[dot.key.test].name}}
```

### Conditional variables

Conditional variables use `if-else` logic to display a different message depending on the state of the monitor and the details of how it was triggered. These variables can be used within the subject or body of the notification message.

The following conditional variables are available:

| Conditional Variable       | The text is displayed if                                           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{#is_alert}}`            | The monitor alerts                                                 |
| `{{^is_alert}}`            | The monitor does not alert                                         |
| `{{#is_match}}`            | The context matches the provided substring                         |
| `{{^is_match}}`            | The context does not match the provided substring                  |
| `{{#is_exact_match}}`      | The context exactly matches the provided string                    |
| `{{^is_exact_match}}`      | The context does not exactly match the provided string             |
| `{{#is_no_data}}`          | The monitor is triggered for missing data                          |
| `{{^is_no_data}}`          | The monitor is notifies on missing data                            |
| `{{#is_warning}}`          | The monitor warns                                                  |
| `{{^is_warning}}`          | The monitor does not warn                                          |
| `{{#is_recovery}}`         | The monitor recovers from `ALERT`, `WARNING`, or `NO DATA`         |
| `{{^is_recovery}}`         | The monitor does not recover from `ALERT`, `WARNING`, or `NO DATA` |
| `{{#is_warning_recovery}}` | The monitor recovers from `WARNING` to `OK`                        |
| `{{^is_warning_recovery}}` | The monitor does not recover from `WARNING` to `OK`                |
| `{{#is_alert_recovery}}`   | The monitor recovers from `ALERT` to `OK`                          |
| `{{^is_alert_recovery}}`   | The monitor does not recover from an ALERT to OK                   |
| `{{#is_alert_to_warning}}` | The monitor transitions from `ALERT` to `WARNING`                  |
| `{{^is_alert_to_warning}}` | The monitor does not transition from `ALERT` to `WARNING`          |
| `{{#is_no_data_recovery}}` | The monitor recovers from `NO DATA`                                |
| `{{^is_no_data_recovery}}` | The monitor does not recover from `NO DATA`                        |

#### Examples

Conditional variable must have an opening and closing pair with the text and **@-notifications** in-between.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "is_alert" %}}

To send a notification message when a monitor alerts, use the format:

```
{{#is_alert}}
  <ALERT_MESSAGE_TEXT> <@-NOTIFICATION>
{{/is_alert}}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "is_warning" %}}

To send a notification message when a monitor warns, use the format:

```
{{#is_warning}}
  <WARNING_MESSAGE_TEXT> <@-NOTIFICATION>
{{/is_warning}}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "is_recovery" %}}

To send a notification message when a monitor recovers, use the format:

```
{{#is_recovery}}
  <RECOVERY_MESSAGE_TEXT> <@-NOTIFICATION>
{{/is_recovery}}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "is_match" %}}

Search for a substring in a tag variable with the format:

```text
{{#is_match "<TAG_VARIABLE>.name" "<COMPARISON_STRING>"}}
  This displays if <COMPARISON_STRING> is included in <TAG_VARIABLE>.
{{/is_match}}
```

To notify your DB team if a triggering host has the tag `role:db_cassandra` or `role:db_postgres`, use the following:

```text
{{#is_match "role.name" "db"}}
  This displays if the host triggering the alert contains `db`
  in the role name. @db-team@company.com
{{/is_match}}
```

**Note**: To check if a `<TAG_VARIABLE>` is **NOT** empty, use an empty string for the `<COMPARISON_STRING>`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "is_exact_match" %}}

Search for an exact string in a tag variable with the format:

```text
{{#is_exact_match "<TAG_VARIABLE>.name" "<COMPARISON_STRING>"}}
  This displays if <COMPARISON_STRING> is exactly <TAG_VARIABLE>.
{{/is_exact_match}}
```

To notify your dev team if a triggering host has the name `production`, use the following:

```text
{{#is_exact_match "host.name" "production"}}
  This displays if the host that triggered the alert is exactly
  named production. @dev-team@company.com
{{/is_exact_match}}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Advanced

### Dynamic links

Use [tag variables](#tag-variables) to enable dynamic URL building that links your team to an appropriate resource. For example, you can of provide links to pages within Datadog such as dashboards, the host map, and managed monitors.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Dashboards" %}}

Leverage the `{{host.name}}` [tag variable](#tag-variables) to provide a link to a system dashboard:

```text
https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/system_overview?tpl_var_scope=host:{{host.name}}
```

Leverage the `{{host.name}}` [tag variable](#tag-variables) and an `<INTEGRATION_NAME>` to provide a link to an integration dashboard:

```text
https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/<INTEGRATION_NAME>?tpl_var_scope=host:{{host.name}}
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Host Map" %}}

To include a link to the HostMap to compare metrics with other similar hosts, use a link like below to be included in your Monitor:

```text
https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map?fillby=avg%3Acpuutilization&sizeby=avg%3Anometric&filter=cassandra
```

The above link has more customizable options than your standard System Dashboard. Here you have additional variables to define. Most common variables passed into this URL are the following **fillby, sizeby, filter**:

* `fillby` is defined by adding `fillby:avg:<MetricName>`.
* `sizeby` is defined by adding `sizeby:avg:<SecondMetricName>`.
* `filter` is used to specify a specific integration (i.e. Cassandra, mysql, apache, snmp, etc) by adding `filter=<INTEGRATION_NAME>`.

In the example below, colors fill the Hostmap hexagons by `system.cpu.system`. The hexagons are sized by `system.cpu.stolen`, and they are filtered to only include Cassandra hosts.

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/hostmap_url.png" alt="hostmap_url"  style="width:70%;">}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Manage Monitors" %}}

To link to a "Manage Monitors" page that displays all of the monitors for the host in question, define a link like below:

```text
https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage?q=scope:host:{{host.name}}
```

The above URL links to all monitors for this host. You have other options available to further refine the link.

For example, to see all monitors in an Alert State, add `status:Alert` (other statuses are `WARN`, `NO%20DATA`, `OK` and `MUTED`). Below is an example link:

```text
https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage?q=scope:host:{{host.name}}&status:Alert
```

If you would like all monitors for a specific application or integration, add the following query to the URL `q=<INTEGRATION_NAME>`:

```text
https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage?q=cassandra
```

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/monitor_url.png" alt="monitor_url"  style="width:70%;">}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Comments

To include a comment in the monitor message that only displays in the monitor edit screen, use the syntax:

```text
{{!-- this is a comment --}}
```

### Raw format

If your alert message needs to send double curly braces, such as `{{ <TEXT> }}`, use `{{{{raw}}}}` formatting. For example, the following:

```text
{{{{raw}}}}
{{ <TEXT_1> }} {{ <TEXT_2> }}
{{{{/raw}}}}
```

Outputs:

```text
{{ <TEXT_1> }} {{ <TEXT_2> }}
```

The `^|#` helpers used in [conditional variables](#conditional-variables) cannot be used with `{{{{raw}}}}` formatting and must be removed. For instance, to output raw text with the `{{is_match}}` conditional variable use the following template:

```text
{{{{is_match "host.name" "<HOST_NAME>"}}}}
{{ .matched }} the host name
{{{{/is_match}}}}
```

If `host.name` matches `<HOST_NAME>`, the template outputs:

```text
{{ .matched }} the host name
```
