Use the [Manage Monitors][1] page to search, delete, mute, or resolve your monitors and edit monitor tags in bulk. You can also clone or edit individual monitors from the search results.

## Search

To [search your monitors][2], construct a query using the facet panel on the left or the search bar at the top.

## Manage

After searching, select one or more monitors to update using the checkboxes next to each result. Select all results with the top checkbox next to the *STATUS* column heading. Modify the monitors in bulk using the buttons at the right above the search results:

| Option    | Description                                                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mute      | [Mute][3] the selected monitors for `1h`, `4h`, `12h`, `1d`, `1w`, or `Forever`. |
| Unmute    | If the selected monitors are muted, unmute them.                           |
| Resolve   | [Resolve][4] the alert for the selected monitors.                          |
| Delete    | Permanently delete the selected monitors.                                  |
| Edit Tags | Edit the monitor tags for the selected monitors.                           |

To edit an individual monitor, hover over it and use the buttons to the far right: Edit, Clone, Mute, Delete. To see more details on a monitor, click its name to see the status page.

**Note**: You can view Monitor Saved Views from your mobile device home screen or view and mute monitors by downloading the [Datadog Mobile App][5], available on the [Apple App Store][6] and [Google Play Store][7].

### Triggered monitors

You can [mute][3] or [resolve][4] triggered monitors in bulk using the [Triggered Monitors][8] page. This page only shows monitors with a triggered status (Alert, Warn, or No Data).

#### Grouped results

The triggered monitors page shows a row for each group (reporting source) of each monitor. For example, a monitor grouped by host with 14 hosts in a triggered status shows 14 rows on the triggered monitors page. This lets you mute or [resolve][3] a monitor for specific reporting sources.

When writing a search query, the same attributes from the manage monitors page are available, even if they are not displayed as check boxes on the triggered monitors page.

Attribute differences for the triggered monitors page:

* `group_status` is the attribute name instead of `status`.
* The `triggered` attribute lets you filter monitors by how long they have been triggered.
* The `group` attribute helps you narrow down search results for monitors grouped by more than one tag. For example, a monitor is grouped by `host` and `env`. After searching, you see four rows with the groups `host:web01,env:dev`, `host:web02,env:dev`, `host:web01,env:prod`, and `host:web02,env:prod`. Use the `group` attribute to only show prod hosts (`group:"env:prod"`) or web02 hosts (`group:"host:web02"`).

### Monitor tags

Monitor tags are independent of tags sent by the Agent or integrations. Add up to 80 tags directly to your monitors for filtering on the [manage monitors][1], [triggered monitors][8], or [manage downtime][9] pages. Learn more about monitor tags in [Assigning Tags for the UI][10].

**Note**: Monitor tags are added to the alert event generated by the monitor.
