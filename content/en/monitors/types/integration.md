## Overview

Use an integration monitor to check if an installed [integration][1] is running. For more detailed monitoring, a metric monitor can be used to gauge specific information about an integration.

## Monitor creation

To create an [integration monitor][2] in Datadog:

1. Use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Integration*.
2. Search for an integration or select it from the list or images.
3. Choose an **Integration Metric** or **Integration Status** monitor:

### Integration metric

Create an integration metric monitor by following the instructions in the [metric monitor][3] documentation. Using the integration metric monitor type ensures the monitor can be selected by the integration monitor type facet on the [Manage Monitors][4] page.

### Integration status

If the integration has a service check, the **Integration Status** tab is active.

**Note**: If the integration does not submit metrics or service checks, it will show up as "Misconfigured".

#### Pick a check

If there is only one check for the integration, no selection is necessary. Otherwise, select the check for your monitor.

#### Pick monitor scope

Select the scope to monitor by choosing host names, tags, or choose `All Monitored Hosts`. If you need to exclude certain hosts, use the second field to list names or tags.

* The include field uses `AND` logic. All listed host names and tags must be present on a host for it to be included.
* The exclude field uses `OR` logic. Any host with a listed host name or tag is excluded.

#### Set alert conditions

In this section, choose between a **Check Alert** or **Cluster Alert**:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Check Alert" %}}

A check alert tracks consecutive statuses submitted per check grouping and compares it to your thresholds.

Set up the check alert:

1. Trigger a separate alert for each `<GROUP>` reporting your check.

    Check grouping is specified either from a list of known groupings or by you. For integration monitors, the per-check grouping is explicitly known. For example, the Postgres integration is tagged with `db`, `host`, and `port`.

2. Trigger the alert after selected consecutive failures: `<NUMBER>`

    Each check run submits a single status of `OK`, `WARN`, `CRITICAL`, or `UNKNOWN`. Choose how many consecutive runs with the `CRITICAL` status trigger a notification. For example, your database might have a single blip where connection fails. If you set this value to `> 1`, the blip is ignored but a problem with more than one consecutive failure triggers a notification.

3. If the integration check reports an `UNKNOWN` status, choose `Do not notify` or `Notify` for Unknown status.

    If enabled, a state transition to `UNKNOWN` triggers a notification. In the [monitor status page][1], the status bar of a group in `UNKNOWN` state uses `NODATA` grey. The overall status of the monitor stays in `OK`.

4. Resolve the alert after selected consecutive successes: `<NUMBER>`

    Choose how many consecutive runs with the `OK` status resolve the alert.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Cluster Alert" %}}

A cluster alert calculates the percent of checks in a given status and compares it to your thresholds.

Set up a cluster alert:

1. Decide whether or not to group your checks according to a tag. `Ungrouped` calculates the status percentage across all sources. `Grouped` calculates the status percentage on a per group basis.

2. Select the percentage for the alert threshold.

Each check tagged with a distinct combination of tags is considered to be a distinct check in the cluster. Only the status of the last check of each combination of tags is taken into account in the cluster percentage calculation.

{{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/process_check/cluster_check_thresholds.png" alt="Cluster Check Thresholds" style="width:90%;">}}

For example, a cluster check monitor grouped by environment can alert if more that 70% of the checks on any of the environments submit a `CRITICAL` status, and warn if more that 50% of the checks on any of the environments submit a `WARN` status.

#### Advanced alert conditions

See the [Monitor configuration][5] documentation for information on [No data][6], [Auto resolve][7], and [New group delay][8] options.

#### Notifications
