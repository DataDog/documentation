## Overview

Datadog automatically creates events from various products including monitors, Watchdog, and Error Tracking. You can also track events generated from the Agent and installed integrations and ingest events from sources, including alert events from third parties, change requests, deployments, configuration changes.

Event monitors alert on ingested events that match a search query, allowing you to focus attention on the events that matter most to your team.

## Monitor creation

To create an [event monitor][1] in Datadog, navigate to **Monitors** > **New Monitor** > **Event**.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note</strong>: There is a default limit of 1000 Event monitors per account. If you are encountering this limit, consider using <a href="/monitors/configuration/?tab=thresholdalert#alert-grouping">multi alerts</a>, or <a href="/help/">Contact Support</a>.</div>

### Define the search query

As you define the search query, the top graph updates.

1. Construct a search query using the [Event Explorer search syntax][2].
2. Choose to monitor over an event count or facet:
    * **Monitor over an event count**: Use the search bar (optional) and do **not** select a facet. Datadog evaluates the number of events over a selected time frame, then compares it to the threshold conditions.
    * **Monitor over a facet**: If a facet is selected, the monitor alerts over the unique value count of the facet.
3. Configure the alert grouping strategy (optional):
    * **Simple-Alert**: Simple alerts aggregate over all reporting sources. You receive one alert when the aggregated value meets the set conditions. This works best to monitor a metric from a single host or the sum of a metric across many hosts. This strategy may be selected to reduce notification noise.
    * **Multi Alert**: Multi alerts apply the alert to each source according to your group parameters, up to 1000 matching groups. An alerting event is generated for each group that meets the set conditions. For example, you can group by `host` to receive separate alerts for each host.

### Set alert conditions

* The count was `above`, `above or equal to`, `below`, or `below or equal to`
* `<THRESHOLD_NUMBER>`
* during the last `5 minutes`, `15 minutes`, `1 hour`, etc. or `custom` to set a value between 5 minutes and 48 hours.

**Note**: Some providers introduce a significant delay between when an event is **posted**, and when the event is initiated. In this case, Datadog back-dates the event to the time of occurrence, which could place an incoming event outside the current monitor evaluation window. Widening your evaluation window can help account for the time difference. If you need help adjusting your monitor settings appropriately, reach out to [Datadog Support][3].

#### Advanced alert conditions

For detailed instructions on the advanced alert options (auto resolve, evaluation delay, etc.), see the [Monitor configuration][4] page.

### Notifications

For detailed instructions on the **Say what's happening** and **Notify your team** sections, see the [Notifications][5] page.

#### Event template variables

Event monitors have specific template variables you can include in the notification message:

| Template variable          | Definition                                                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{event.id}}`             | The ID of the event.                                                           |
| `{{event.title}}`          | The title of the event.                                                        |
| `{{event.text}}`           | The text of the event.                                                         |
| `{{event.host.name}}`      | The name of the host that generated the event.                                 |
| `{{event.tags}}`           | A list of tags attached to the event.                                          |
| `{{event.tags.<TAG_KEY>}}` | The value for a specific tag key attached to the event. See the example below. |

##### Tags `key:value` syntax

For the tags `env:test`, `env:staging`, and `env:prod`:

* `env` is the tag key.
* `test`, `staging`, and `prod` are the tag values.

The template variable is `{{event.tags.env}}`. The result of using this template variable is `test`, `staging`, or `prod`.
