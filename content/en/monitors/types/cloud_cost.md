## Overview
Cloud Cost Monitors help you proactively identify cost changes, and understand if you're projected to go over budget, so you can investigate the cause. 

- Instantly view all your cost monitors and filter or search by team, service, tag, provider, or alert status.
- See a summary of how many monitors are set up, which are alerting, and what areas of cloud spend are tracked.
- Create new cost monitors using templates and take action on monitors that need attention.

In order to configure Cloud Cost monitors, you need to have [Cloud Cost Management][1] set up.

Cloud Cost monitors use a 30-minute evaluation frequency and a 48-hour delayed evaluation window, since cost data may not be available until 48 hours after usage. For example, a 7-day lookback evaluated on January 15 examines cost data from January 6 to January 13.

## Create a monitor

To create a Cloud Cost monitor in Datadog, navigate to [**Cloud Cost > Analyze > Cost Monitors** ][4] and click **+ New Cost Monitor**.

Alternatively, you can set one up from [**Monitors** --> **New Monitor** --> **Cloud Cost**][3], the main navigation, the [Cloud Cost Explorer][5], or through [Terraform][2].

### Select a cost monitor type

You can select from the following monitor types:
| Monitor Type | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Changes      | Detect daily, weekly, or monthly cost changes.  | Alert when the difference between today's cost and the week before is over 5%. |
| Anomalies    | Identify unusual or unexpected cost patterns. <br> <br> Incomplete days are excluded from analysis to ensure accuracy. Anomaly monitors require at least 1 month of cloud cost data to evaluate since historical data is required to train the algorithm. | Alert if 3 days from the past 30 days show significant cost anomalies compared to historical data. |
| Threshold    | Alert when costs exceed a set value. | Set alerts when today's total cost exceeds $10,000.              |
| Forecast     | Alert if forecasted costs will exceed your budget. | Alert daily if the forecasted cost for this month is projected to exceed $500. |

### Specify which cost to track

Any cost type or metric reporting to Datadog is available for monitors. You can use custom metrics or observability metrics alongside a cost metric to monitor unit economics.

| Step                              | Required | Default              | Example             |
|-----------------------------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Select the cost metric            | Yes      | All providers | `azure.cost.actual` |
| Define the `filter by`            | No       | Nothing           | `aws_product:s3`    |
| Group by                          | No       | Nothing           | `aws_availability_zone` |
| Add observability metric          | No       | `system.cpu.user`    | `aws.s3.all_requests` |

Use the editor to define the cost types or exports.

For more information, see the [Cloud Cost Management documentation][1].

### Set alert conditions

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Changes" %}}

If you are using the **Cost Changes** monitor type, you can trigger an alert when the cost `increases` or `decreases` more than the defined threshold. The threshold can be set to either a **Percentage Change** or set to **Dollar Amount**.

If you are using the **Percentage Change**, you can filter out changes that are below a certain dollar threshold. For example, the monitor alerts when there is a cost change above 5% for any change that is above $500.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Anomalies" %}}

For the **Cost Anomalies** monitor type, you can trigger an alert if the observed cost is `above`, `below`, or `above or below` a threshold compared to historical data.

The `agile` [anomaly algorithm][101] is used with two bounds and monthly seasonality.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Threshold" %}}

If you are using the **Cost Threshold** monitor type, you can trigger an alert when the cloud cost is `above`, `below`, `above or equal`, or `below or equal to` a threshold.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Forecast" %}}

If you are using the **Cost Forecast** monitor type, you can trigger an alert when the cloud cost is `above`, `below`, `above or equal`, `below or equal to`, `equal to`, or `not equal to` a threshold.

### Configure notifications and automations

For detailed instructions on the **Configure notifications and automations** section, see the [Notifications][6] page.

### Define permissions and audit notifications

Choose which teams, roles, users, or service accounts are allowed to **view** or **edit** the monitor. By default, all members of your organization have access.

You can also turn on **Audit Notifications** to alert the monitor creator and recipients whenever the monitor is changed.

## Other actions you can take

{{< img src="/monitors/monitor_types/cloud_cost/cost-monitors-other-actions.png" alt="The actions menu open with options to view the monitor in the Cloud Cost Explorer, as well as options to edit, clone, and delete the monitor." style="width:100%;" >}}

- **View in Monitors** to see your monitor's alert history, adjust visualizations, and review how often it has triggered alerts.
- **View in Explorer** to open the monitor in the Cloud Cost Explorer for deeper analysis.
- **Edit** a monitor to update the monitor's settings or configuration.
- **Clone** a monitor to create a copy of an existing monitor by choosing **Actions > Clone**.
- **Delete** a monitor to permanently remove a monitor you no longer need.
