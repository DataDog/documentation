## Overview

[Watchdog][1] is an algorithmic feature for APM, Infrastructure, and Logs. It automatically detects potential issues by continuously observing trends and patterns in metrics and logs, and looking for atypical behavior.

## Monitor creation

To create a [Watchdog monitor][2] in Datadog, use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Watchdog*.

## Define your query
Select the scope to be alerted on with the following optional configurations (wildcards are supported):

**1. Predefined selectors**
* Environment. These values are derived from the `env` tag.
* Alert Category. Scope the monitor to a subset of Watchdog alerts.
* Team. These values are derived from the Service Catalog.

**2. Additional scoping**
* Filter on any additional tag available on the Watchdog event.
* Group By the dimensions you want to [group notifications by][3].

After your selections are made, the graph at the top of the monitor creation page displays the matching Watchdog events over the selected time frame.

### Notifications

For more instructions on the **Notify your team** section, see the [Notifications][4] page.
