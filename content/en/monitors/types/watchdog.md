## Overview

[Watchdog][1] is an algorithmic feature for APM, Infrastructure, and Logs. It automatically detects potential issues by continuously observing trends and patterns in metrics and logs, and looking for atypical behavior.

## Monitor creation

To create a [Watchdog monitor][2] in Datadog, use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Watchdog*.

### Select alert type

In this section, choose between an APM, Infrastructure, or Logs alert:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "APM" %}}

An APM alert is created when Watchdog detects anomalous behavior on your system's services or their child resources.

### Select sources {#select-sources-1}

Select the scope to be alerted on by configuring:

**1. Predefined selectors**
* The type of Watchdog anomaly: Error Rates, Latency, Hits, or any APM alert
* The value for APM primary tags (see the [Set primary tags to scope][1] page for instructions to configure APM primary and second primary tags)
* The [APM service][2] (choose `Any services` to monitor all services)
* The [APM resource][3] of a service (choose `*` to monitor all resources of a service)

**2. Additional filters**
* Filter on any additional tag available on the Watchdog event (like `team` for example)
* Boolean and wildcards are supported
* Dimensions available on the predefined selectors should not be used in the additional filters

**3. Group By**
* The dimensions you want to [group notifications by][4]

After your selections are made, the graph at the top of the monitor creation page displays the matching Watchdog events over the selected time frame.

### Select sources {#select-sources-2}

Select the scope to be alerted on by configuring:

**1. Predefined selectors**
* The Infrastructure integration to cover (select `Any Infrastructure alert` to cover them all). See the [Watchdog overview][1] for a full list of integrations covered by Watchdog infrastructure)
* The Tags available for the selected integration

**2. Additional filters**
* Filter on any additional tag available on the Watchdog event (like `team` for example)
* Boolean and wildcards are supported
* Dimensions available on the predefined selectors should not be used in the additional filters

**3. Group By**
* The dimensions you want to [group notifications by][2]

After your selections are made, the graph at the top of the monitor creation page displays the matching Watchdog events over the selected time frame.

A logs alert indicates that either a new pattern of error logs has been detected or that there has been an increase in an existing pattern of error logs.

### Select sources {#select-sources-3}

Select the scope to be alerted on by configuring:

**1. Predefined selectors**
* The environment (leave empty to alert on all environments). These values are derived from the `env` tag in your logs
* The service (leave empty to alert on all services). These values are derived from the `service` [reserved attribute][2] in your logs
* The log source (leave empty to alert on all sources). These values are derived from the `source` [reserved attribute][2] in your logs
* The log status (leave empty to alert on all status). These values are derived from the `status` [reserved attribute][2] in your logs
* The log anomaly type (`new Error` or `Spike in existing logs`) determines whether the anomaly describes a new pattern of error logs or an increase in an existing pattern of error logs

**2. Additional filters**
* Filter on any additional tag available on the Watchdog event (like `team` for example)
* Boolean and wildcards are supported
* Dimensions available on the predefined selectors should not be used in the additional filters

**3. Group By**
* The dimensions you want to [group notifications by][1]

After your selections are made, the graph at the top of the monitor creation page displays the matching Watchdog events over the selected time frame.
