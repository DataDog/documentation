## Overview

Once [Real User Monitoring is enabled][1] for your organization, you can create a RUM monitor to alert you when a specified type of RUM event exceeds a user-defined threshold over a given period of time.

## Monitor creation

To create a [RUM monitor][2] in Datadog, use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Real User Monitoring*.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note</strong>: There is a default limit of 1000 RUM monitors per account. <a href="/help/">Contact Support</a> to lift this limit for your account.</div>

### Define the search query

As you define the search query, the graph above the search fields updates.

1. Construct a search query using the same logic as a [RUM explorer search][3].
2. Choose to monitor over a RUM event count, [facet][4], or [measure][5]:
    * **Monitor over a RUM event count**: Use the search bar (optional) and do **not** select a facet or measure. Datadog evaluates the number of RUM events over a selected time frame, then compares it to the threshold conditions.
    * **Monitor over a facet**: If a [facet][4] is selected, the monitor alerts over the `Unique value count` of the facet.
    * **Monitor over measure**: If a [measure][5] is selected, the monitor alerts over the numerical value of the RUM facet (similar to a metric monitor) and aggregation needs to be selected (`min`, `avg`, `sum`, `median`, `pc75`, `pc90`, `pc95`, `pc98`, `pc99`, or `max`).
3. Group RUM events by multiple dimensions (optional):
    All RUM events matching the query are aggregated into groups based on the value of up to four facets.
4. Configure the alerting grouping strategy (optional):
    * **Simple alert**: Simple alerts aggregate over all reporting sources. You receive one alert when the aggregated value meets the set conditions.</br>
    If the query has a `group by` and you select simple-Alert mode, you get **one** alert when one or multiple groups values breach the threshold. This strategy may be selected to reduce notification noise.
    * **Multi alert**: Multi alerts apply the alert to each source according to your group parameters. An alerting event is generated for each group that meets the set conditions. For example, you could group a query by `@browser.name` to receive a separate alert for each browser when the number of errors is high.

### Set alert conditions

* Trigger when the metric is `above`, `above or equal to`, `below`, or `below or equal to`
* the threshold during the last `5 minutes`, `15 minutes`, `1 hour`, etc. or `custom` to set a value between 5 minutes and 48 hours.
* Alert threshold `<NUMBER>`
* Warning threshold `<NUMBER>`

#### No data and below alerts

To receive a notification when an application has stopped sending RUM events, set the condition to `below 1`. This notifies when no RUM events match the monitor query in a given timeframe across all aggregate groups.

When splitting the monitor by any dimension (tag or facet) and using a `below` condition, the alert is triggered **if and only if** there are RUM events for a given group, and the count is below the thresholdâ€”or if there are no RUM events for **all** of the groups.

**Examples**:

* This monitor triggers if and only if there are no RUM events for all applications:

* This monitor triggers if there are no logs for the application `Shop.ist`:
  {{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/rum/rum_monitoring_by_shopist.png" alt="Below monitor for given application"  style="width:70%;" >}}

#### Advanced alert conditions

For detailed instructions on the advanced alert options (evaluation delay, etc.), see the [Monitor configuration][6] page.

### Notifications

For detailed instructions on the **Say what's happening** and **Notify your team** sections, see the [Notifications][7] page.
