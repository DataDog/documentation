# Overview

Notification Rules allow you to configure scenarios when specific stakeholders should always be automatically notified of an incident. You can use Notification Rules to ensure key stakeholders are always made aware of high priority incidents or to notify external systems whenever a new incident is declared or updated.

## Configuration

To configure a new Notification Rule:

1. Go to the *Notification Rules* section of your [Incident Settings][1]
2. Click **New Rule**
3. Pick your notification recipients. Notifications can be sent to any of Datadog's existing [notification integrations][2].
4. Pick the Incident severities you want notifications to be sent for. By default, a rule will notify your recipients on any incident severity.
5. Choose whether you want recipients to be renotified when an incident changes its status.
6. Click **Save**

**Example:** Set a Notification Rule to automatically notify executives whenever a SEV-1 incident is declared and when that incident moves through different states of progression.
