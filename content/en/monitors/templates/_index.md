## Overview

A collection of recommended monitor templates are pre-configured by Datadog and integration partners. Use monitor templates to:
- Save the time and effort of creating a new monitor from scratch.
- Have comprehensive monitoring coverage for all your critical integrations.

## Browse monitor templates

{{< img src="monitors/recommended/recommended_templates.png" alt="Monitor templates provided based on your integrations" style="width:100%;" >}}

 Monitor Templates are available out-of-the-box, so you can get started immediately after you finish installing the Datadog Agent and add integrations.

Navigate to the [**Monitor List**][2] page. If you have fewer than 10 monitors, Datadog automatically recommends a list of Integration-Monitor Templates based on your installed integrations.

To browse the full list of monitor templates, navigate to the [**Monitors > Templates**][1] page. Filter and search all available Integration-Monitor Templates for your installed integrations as well as all available templates.
