Ephemeral environments spin up and terminate hosts constantly which can make it challenging to distinguish new hosts from rebooted hosts.

A metric monitor on the `system.uptime` metric can be used to address this. The uptime metric is an ever increasing timer which resets to 0 when a host boots up and can be evaluated using the diff() [function][1], to distinguish between a start at 0 (new server) and a change (diff) of a running uptime value to a 0 value.

The example shown below captures how this can be setup:
