Service checks can be visualized and used in 3 Datadog sections:

* [Check Summary][1]
* [Screenboards][2]
* [Custom check Monitor][3]

## Check Summary

To reach [Check Summary][1], click on the *Monitors* tab then on *Check Summary*.

{{< img src="monitors/faq/check_summary.png" alt="Check summary" responsive="true" >}}

This is the list of all your checks and their status reporting across your infrastructure in the past day. Select a check to get insights on the number of distinct checks for each of its associated tags.

## Screenboards

Service checks can be visualized in a *Check status* widget in Screenboards:

{{< img src="monitors/faq/check_status_widget.png" alt="Check status widget" responsive="true" >}}
​
After clicking on the *Check status* widget icon, the following pop-up appears:

{{< img src="monitors/faq/check_widget_config.png" alt="Check widget config" responsive="true" >}}

In this form you can:

* **Check Name**: Select your service check name.
* **Reporting Timeframe**: Select the time frame on which you want to aggregate your status.
* **Scoping**: Select a single check or a cluster of check statuses reported by a single tag value or a tag group.
* **Widget Title**: Set your widget title.

## Custom check monitor

Even if you can't graph a custom check over time as you would for metrics, you can still monitor it.
Go to *monitor tab* > *new monitor*, then select the **custom check** section:
 
{{< img src="monitors/faq/check_monitor.png" alt="Check monitor" responsive="true" >}}

Configure your custom check monitor: 
​
{{< img src="monitors/faq/check_monitor_config.png" alt="Check monitor configuration" responsive="true" >}}

In this form, you can:

* **Pick a custom check**: Select your check status name to monitor
* **Pick monitor scope**: Select the context for your monitor (including/excluding tags)
* **Set alert conditions**: Choose between a simple check alert or a cluster alert
* **Say what's happening**: Edit the notification sent (find more about [Datadog notifications][4].)
* **Notify your team**: Choose who should be notified by this monitor

Service check monitors for out-of-the-box Datadog integrations can be set in *monitor tab* > *Integration* > *Integration status* tab on the left. For instance, with the HAProxy integration: 

{{< img src="monitors/faq/haproxy_service_check.gif" alt="Haproxy service check" responsive="true" >}}
