Schedule downtimes for system shutdowns, off-line maintenance, or upgrades without triggering your monitors.

## Schedule

To schedule a [monitor downtime][1] in Datadog use the main navigation: _Monitors â€“> Manage Downtime_. Then, click the **Schedule Downtime** button in the upper right.

### Choose what to silence

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "By Monitor Name" %}}

Search or use the drop-down to choose monitors to silence. If the field is left empty, all monitors are silenced by default. You can also select a scope to constrain your downtime to a specific host, device, or arbitrary tag.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "By Monitor Tags" %}}

Schedule a downtime based on one or more [monitor tags][1]. You must select at least one tag with a limit of 32 tags. Each tag can be at most 256 characters long. Only monitors that have **ALL selected tags** are silenced. You can also select scopes for additional constraints.

[1]: /monitors/manage_monitor/#monitor-tags
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

If you choose to silence monitors constrained by scope, click **Preview affected monitors** to see the monitors included. Any monitors created or edited after the downtime is scheduled are automatically included in the downtime if they match the scope.

**Note**: If a multi-alert monitor is included, it is only silenced for groups covered by the scope. For example, if a downtime is scoped for `host:X` and a multi-alert is triggered on both `host:X` and `host:Y`, Datadog generates a monitor notification for `host:Y`, but not `host:X`.

### Schedule

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "One Time" %}}

Set a one time downtime by entering the start date, time, and time zone. Optionally, set an end date and time.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Recurring" %}}

Recurring downtimes are useful for recurring maintenance windows.

Set a recurring downtime by entering the start date, time, time zone, repeat, and duration. Optionally, specify an end date or number of occurrences.

When a single downtime of a recurring downtime ends, the single downtime is cancelled and a new downtime is created with the same constraints and updated start and end times. **Note**: The original creator is associated to all the newly created downtimes.

### Add a message

Enter a message to notify your team about this downtime. The message field allows standard [markdown formatting][2] and Datadog's `@-notification` syntax.

### Notify your team

Notify your team by specifying team members or send the message to a service [integration][3].

## Manage

The Manage Downtime page displays the list of active and scheduled downtimes. Select a downtime to view details, edit, or delete it. Use the _Filter downtimes_ text box to search your downtimes.

### History

Downtime history is viewable on the [Monitor Status][4] page as overlaid on the group transition history, and the [Event stream][5] by searching for `tags:audit,downtime`, or a specific downtime by ID with `tags:audit,downtime_id:<DOWNTIME_ID>`.

### Muting

Monitors trigger events when they change between possible states: `ALERT`, `WARNING`, `RESOLVED`, and `NO DATA`. When a monitor is muted or has a scheduled downtime, transitions from `RESOLVED` to another state do **not** trigger events or notifications.

{{< img src="monitors/downtimes/downtime_on_alert.png" alt="downtime on alert"  style="width:80%;">}}

**Note**: Muting or un-muting a monitor with the UI does not delete scheduled downtimes associated with the monitor. To edit or delete a downtime, use the [Manage Downtimes][1] page or the [API][6].

If a monitor transitions states during a downtime (such as from `OK` to `ALERT`, `WARNING`, or `NO DATA`) and remains in that state once a scheduled downtime expires, it does **NOT** trigger a notification. However, it does trigger the recovery event when data returns for the scope or the monitor returns to an `OK` state.

This behavior is designed to prevent `NO DATA` alerts when using the *Autoresolve* feature. If you prefer the monitor to trigger a `NO DATA` event at the time the silencing expires, reach out to the [Datadog support team][7] to have the feature enabled for your account. **Note**: This only affects instances when a monitor exits a downtime period in a `NO DATA` state.

If a monitor triggers an alert **before** a downtime and recovers **during** that downtime, then a recovery event is sent during the downtime (if this is the first recovery during that downtime).

### Monitor report

All alerted states are included on the [weekly monitor report][8] even if the monitor is in a downtime.
