Schedule downtimes for system shutdowns, off-line maintenance, or upgrades without triggering your monitors.

## Schedule

To schedule a [monitor downtime][1] in Datadog use the main navigation: _Monitors â€“> Manage Downtime_. Then, click the **Schedule Downtime** button in the upper right.

### Choose what to silence

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "By Monitor Name" %}}

Search or use the drop-down to choose monitors to silence. If the field is left empty, all monitors are silenced by default. You can also select a scope to constrain your downtime to a specific host, device, or arbitrary tag.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "By Monitor Tags" %}}

Schedule a downtown based on one or more [monitor tags][1]. You must select at least one tag with a limit of 32 tags. Each tag can be at most 256 characters long. Only monitors that have **ALL selected tags** are silenced. You can also select scopes for additional constraints.

[1]: /monitors/manage_monitor/#monitor-tags
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

If you choose to silence all monitors constrained by a scope, clicking *Preview affected monitors* shows which monitors are affected. Any monitors within the scope and created or edited after the scheduled downtime are silenced. **Note**: If a multi-alert is included, it is only silenced for groups covered by the scope. For example, if a downtime is scoped for `host:X` and a multi-alert is triggered on both `host:X` and `host:Y`, Datadog generates a monitor notification for `host:Y`, but not `host:X`.

### Schedule

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "One Time" %}}

Set a one time downtime by entering the start date, time, and time zone. Optionally, set an end date and time.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Recurring" %}}

Recurring downtimes are useful for recurring maintenance windows.

Set a recurring downtime by entering the start date, time, time zone, repeat, and duration. Optionally, specify an end by date or a specified number of occurrences.

When a recurring downtime ends, the downtime is cancelled and a new downtime with the same constraints (with updated start and end times) is created in a rolling pattern.

**Note**: The original creator is associated to all of the newly created downtimes.

### Add a message

Enter a message to notify your team about this downtime. The message field allows standard [markdown formatting][2] as well as Datadog's @-notification syntax.

### Notify your team

Notify your team by specifying team members or send the message to a service [integration][3].

**Note**: Create the downtime before you create the monitor or before you mute the group.

## Search

The Manage Downtime page displays a list of active and scheduled downtimes. Select a downtime to view more details about the host and monitors affected.

Downtime history can be seen both on the Monitor Status Page as overlaid on the group transition history, as well as in the Event Stream by searching for `tags:audit,downtime`, or a specific downtime by ID with `tags:audit,downtime_id:<DOWNTIME_ID>`

## Muting monitors

Monitors trigger events when they change states: `ALERT`, `WARNING`, `RESOLVED`, and `NO DATA`. When a monitor is muted or has a scheduled downtime, transitions from `RESOLVED` to another state does **not** trigger an event or notifications.

**Note**: Muting or un-muting a monitor with the UI does not delete scheduled downtimes associated with that monitor. For that, use the Manage Downtimes feature or the [API][4].

{{< img src="monitors/downtimes/downtime_on_alert.png" alt="downtime on alert"  style="width:80%;">}}

If a monitor transitions states during a downtime (such as from `OK` to `ALERT`, `WARNING`, or `NO DATA`) and remains in that state once a scheduled downtime expires, it does **NOT** trigger a notification. However, it does trigger a recovery event once data returns for that scope or the monitor returns to an `OK` state.

This behavior is designed to prevent spammy `NO DATA` state alerts when using the *Autoresolve* feature. If you would prefer that the monitor trigger a `NO DATA` state event at the time that the silencing expires, [reach out to the Datadog support team][5] to request that this feature is enabled for your account. This only affects instances when a monitor exits a downtime period in a `NO DATA` state.

If a monitor triggers an alert **before** a downtime and recovers **during** that downtime, then a recovery event is sent during the downtime (if this is the first recovery during that downtime).

### Monitor report

All alerted states are included on the [weekly monitor report][6] even if the monitor is in a downtime.
