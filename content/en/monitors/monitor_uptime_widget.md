<div class="alert alert-warning">
The monitor uptime widget is in private beta. Private beta is currently closed for new requests, but you can <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/KmWpQebCeeOdpPAq1">sign up to be included in the beta waitlist</a>.
</div>

Use the monitor uptime widget to track your monitor’s uptime via a widget in your [screenboards][1]. *Monitor uptime* is defined as the amount of time a monitor was in an *up* state (OK) compared to *down* state (non-OK). Similar to the monitor status page visualization, the status is represented in bars as green (up) and red (down).

## Widget configuration

{{< img src="monitors/monitor_uptime_widget_configuration.png" alt="monitor uptime widget configuration" responsive="true" >}}

To configure the widget from a [screenboard][1]:

1. Select the monitor to display uptime for.
    
    *Optionally* - Select the monitor group ordering between the worst performing 5 groups, best performing 5 groups, or custom (select up to 5 custom groups). The total percentage is based on the worst state of any group, which when selected by group can be calculated based on the entire monitor or scoped by the selected groups.

    You can also select, *Query multiple monitors* and use the monitor search query to select up to 5 monitors.

2. If the widget is configured to report by groups, only one duration can be selected; otherwise, select up to 3 uptime durations for your widget from:
    * 7 days 
    * 30 days
    * Month to date
    * 90 days

    For the 7 days option, the widget is restricted to 1 decimal place of accuracy. For 30 days and up, the widget is restricted to 2 decimal places of accuracy. 

3. Select the conditional formatting based on the uptime percentage: red (down) / green (up) / yellow (warn).

4. To finish the configuration, give a title to your widget and save it to your [screenboard][1]. 

## Widget behavior

If the chosen monitor for the widget is configured to alert on *WARN* or *NO DATA*, those states are rendered as down (red) inside the uptime widget.

To ensure accurate calculations, new monitors aren't calculated until the end of the first UTC day. Until the first UTC day is over, a warning message is displayed instead: `Calculating Uptime`.

While the widget is in private beta, Datadog engineering teams are working through the final implementation. **Thus, until the end of the beta phase, do not rely on the uptime percentage**. Should you see any discrepancies or unexpected behaviors, reach out to [the Datadog support team][2].
