## Missing profiles in the profile search page

If you've configured the profiler and don't see profiles in the profile search page, turn on [debug mode][1] and [open a support ticket][2] with debug files and the following information:

- Operating system type and version (for example, Linux Ubuntu 20.04)
- Runtime type, version, and vendor (for example, Python 3.9.5)

Refer to the python APM client [troubleshooting documentation][3] for additional guidance.
