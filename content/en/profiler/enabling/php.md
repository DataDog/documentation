## Requirements

For a summary of the minimum and recommended runtime and tracer versions across all languages, read [Supported Language and Tracer Versions][14].

The Datadog Profiler requires at least PHP 7.1, on 64-bit Linux.

The following are **not** supported:
- PHP ZTS builds
- PHP debug builds

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "GNU C Linux" %}}

An operating system with glibc 2.17 or newer is required. The following versions or newer meet this requirement:
  - CentOS 7.
  - Debian 8, which has reached end of life (EOL).
  - Ubuntu 14.04, which is EOL.

Datadog recommends running an OS version that is not EOL.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Alpine Linux" %}}

Version 3.13 or newer of Alpine Linux is required because the profiler is built against musl v1.2.

Additionally you need to install `libgcc_s` with:

```shell
apk add libgcc
```

The following profiling features are available in the following minimum versions of the `dd-trace-php` library:

|      Feature              | Required `dd-trace-php` version          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [Code Hotspots][12]       | 0.71+                                    |
| [Endpoint Profiling][13]  | 0.79.0+                                  |
| [Timeline][15]            | beta, 0.89.0+                            |

Continuous Profiler is not supported on serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda.

## Installation

To begin profiling applications:

1. Ensure Datadog Agent v6+ is installed and running. Datadog recommends using [Datadog Agent v7+][2].

2. Download the `datadog-setup.php` script from the [GitHub release page][3]. Version 0.69.0 is the first tracer release to include this installer.

3. Run the installer to install both the tracer and profiler, for example `php datadog-setup.php --enable-profiling`. This script is interactive and asks which of the detected PHP locations it should install to. At the end of the script, it outputs the non-interactive version of the command arguments for future use.

4. Configure the profiler using config mode through the `datadog-setup.php`:

    ```
    # `datadog.profiling_enabled` is not required for v0.82.0+.
    php datadog-setup.php config set -d datadog.profiling.    enabled=1
    
    php datadog-setup.php config set -d datadog.service=app-name     \
      -d datadog.env=prod \
      -d datadog.version=1.3.2
    
    php hello.php
    ```
    
    Apache, PHP-FPM and other servers require a restart after changing the INI
settings.

    See the [configuration docs][4] for more INI settings.

5. A minute or two after receiving a request, profiles appear on the [APM > Profiler page][5].

## Not sure what to do next?

The [Getting Started with Profiler][6] guide takes a sample service with a performance problem and shows you how to use Continuous Profiler to understand and fix the problem.
