## Overview

Starting with [Go 1.21][1], the Go compiler supports profile-guided optimization (PGO).

PGO enables additional optimizations on code identified as hot by CPU profiles of production workloads. This is compatible with [Datadog Go Continuous Profiler][2] and can be used for production builds.

## How PGO works

Here are some key points about how PGO works:

- Building a Go program with PGO enabled causes the compiler to look for a pprof CPU profile named `default.pgo` and use it to produce a more optimized binary.
- Typical programs should see a 2-14% decrease in CPU time after optimization. PGO remains under active development, and future versions of Go aim to achieve even greater CPU savings. Datadog is [actively supporting this initiative][3].
- PGO produces the best results when using representative profiles. However, using non-representative or old profiles (from previous versions of the software) is not expected to result in slower binaries compared to not using PGO.
- Using a profile from a PGO optimized application is not expected to cause optimization/deoptimization cycles. This is referred to as iterative stability.

For more information, see the [Go PGO documentation][6].

## Enabling PGO

PGO is a standard Go compiler option that you can use by manually downloading profiles from Datadog. Datadog built a tool, `datadog-pgo` to help you enable PGO on all services, using the latest and most representative profiles.

To enable PGO using the `datadog-pgo` tool:

1. Create a dedicated API key and unscoped application key for PGO as described in [API and Application Keys][5].
2. Set `DD_API_KEY`, `DD_APP_KEY`, and `DD_SITE` with the environment secret mechanism of your CI provider.
3. Run `datadog-pgo` before your build step.  
   For example, for a service `foo` that runs in `prod` and has its main package in `./cmd/foo`, you should add this step:

   ```
   go run github.com/DataDog/datadog-pgo@latest 'service:foo env:prod' ./cmd/foo/default.pgo
   ```

The Go toolchain automatically picks up any `default.pgo` file in the main package, so you don't need to modify your `go build` step.

See the [datadog-pgo GitHub repository][4] for more details.

## Checking if PGO is enabled

To check where PGO is enabled, search for [Go profiles without pgo tag set to true][7]. 

The `pgo` tag was implemented in dd-trace-go 1.61.0, so any profiles prior to this version will not have `pgo:false`.
