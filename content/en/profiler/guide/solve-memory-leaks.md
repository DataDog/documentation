## Overview

Profiling has several datasets to help solve memory leaks, such as the Live Heap profile type, which is [available for multiple languages][1].

To help you get started, Datadog provides an end-to-end, guided walkthrough for Go services:

## What to expect

Following this walkthrough requires zero prior knowledge, and it is accessible for first-time investigations.

The walkthrough guides you through several steps to:
1. Scope to the relevant data.
2. Recommend Datadog integrations and upgrades that assist in the investigation.
3. Explain how memory management works in your runtime.
4. Propose potential root causes through [Profile Comparisons][2].

## Requirements
