## Setup

<div class="alert alert-info">At this time, Bits AI Dev Agent supports GitHub only.</div>

### Enable the GitHub integration

To use Bits AI Dev Agent, you must install the [GitHub integration][4]. For full installation and configuration steps, see the [GitHub integration guide][5].

<div class="alert alert-info">
  To support core Bits AI Dev Agent functionality, the GitHub integration must be granted the following permissions:
  <ul style="font-size: inherit; padding-left: 1.25rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    <li style="font-size: inherit;"><strong>Repository Permissions</strong> (<code>Contents: Read & Write</code>, <code>Pull Requests: Read & Write</code>)</li>
    <li style="font-size: inherit;"><strong>Subscribe to Events</strong> (<code>Push</code>)</li>
  </ul>
  The Dev Agent can also iterate on PRs using CI logs to try and pass CI checks. This feature requires CI logs to be sent to Datadog and the Auto-commit feature to be enabled. The following permissions are required for this feature:
  <ul style="font-size: inherit; padding-left: 1.25rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    <li style="font-size: inherit;"><strong>Repository Permissions</strong> (<code>Checks: Read</code>, <code>Commit Statuses: Read Only</code>)</li>
    <li style="font-size: inherit;"><strong>Subscribe to Events</strong> (<code>Check run</code>, <code>Check suite</code>, <code>Issue comment</code>, <code>Status</code>)</li>
  </ul>
</div> 

### Tag telemetry with service and version

Bits AI Dev Agent uses the `service` and `version` telemetry tags to match issues such as errors or vulnerabilities to the version of your code that was running at the time. To configure telemetry tagging, see the [Tag your telemetry with Git information][6] section of the Datadog Source Code Integration documentation.
