## Overview

Datadog's managed MCP Server acts as a bridge between your observability data in Datadog and AI agents that support the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)][1]. Providing structured access to relevant Datadog contexts, features, and tools, the MCP Server lets you query and retrieve observability insights directly from AI-powered clients such as Cursor, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, or your own AI agent.

This page provides instructions for connecting your AI agent to the Datadog MCP Server, lists the available tools, and includes example prompts.

This demo shows the Datadog MCP Server being used in Cursor and Claude Code (unmute for audio):

{{< img src="bits_ai/mcp_server/mcp_cursor_demo_3.mp4" alt="Demo of Datadog MCP Server in Cursor and Claude Code" video="true" >}}

| [Cline][18] | Cline Bot | Limited support for remote authentication. Use [local binary authentication](?tab=localbinaryauthentication#connect-in-supported-ai-clients) as needed. |

## Requirements

Datadog users must have the `Incidents Read` [permission][19] to use the MCP Server.

## Connect in Cursor and VS Code

Datadog's [Cursor and VS Code extension][12] includes built-in access to the managed Datadog MCP Server. Benefits include:

* No additional MCP Server setup after you install the extension and connect to Datadog.
* One-click transitions between multiple Datadog organizations.
* [Cursor only] Better fixes from **Fix in Chat** on Code Insights (issues from Error Tracking, Code Vulnerabilities, and Library Vulnerabilities), informed by context from the MCP Server.

To install the extension:

1. If you previously installed the Datadog MCP Server manually, remove it from the IDE's configuration to avoid conflicts. To find the MCP Server configuration:
   - Cursor: Go to **Cursor Settings** (`Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `J`) and select the **MCP** tab.
   - VS Code: Open the command palette (`Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`.
2. Install the Datadog extension following [these instructions][14]. If you have the extension installed already, make sure it's the latest version, as new features are released regularly.
3. Sign in to your Datadog account. If you have multiple accounts, use the account included in your Product Preview.
    {{< img src="bits_ai/mcp_server/ide_sign_in.png" alt="Sign in to Datadog from the IDE extension" style="width:70%;" >}}
4. **Restart the IDE.**
5. Confirm the Datadog MCP Server is available and the [tools](#available-tools) are listed in your IDE:
    - Cursor: Go to **Cursor Settings** (`Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `J`), and select the **MCP** tab.
    - VS Code: Open the chat panel, select agent mode, and click the **Configure Tools** button.
       {{< img src="bits_ai/mcp_server/vscode_configure_tools_button.png" alt="Configure Tools button in VS Code" style="width:70%;" >}}

## Connect in supported AI clients

The following instructions are for all [MCP-compatible clients](#client-compatibility). For Cursor or VS Code, use the [Datadog extension](#connect-in-cursor-and-vs-code) for built-in access to the Datadog MCP Server.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Remote authentication" %}}
This method uses the MCP specification's [Streamable HTTP][1] transport mechanism to connect to the MCP Server.

Point your AI agent to the MCP Server endpoint for your regional [Datadog site][2]. For example, if you're using `app.datadoghq.com` to access Datadog, use the endpoint for the US1 site.

If your organization uses a [custom sub-domain][3], use the endpoint that corresponds to your regional Datadog site. For example, if your custom sub-domain is `myorg.datadoghq.com`, use the US1 endpoint.

| Datadog Site | MCP Server Endpoint |
|--------|------|
| **US1** (`app.datadoghq.com`) | `https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` |
| **US3** (`us3.datadoghq.com`) | `https://mcp.us3.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` |
| **US5** (`us5.datadoghq.com`) | `https://mcp.us5.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` |
| **EU1** (`app.datadoghq.eu`) | `https://mcp.datadoghq.eu/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` |
| **AP1** (`ap1.datadoghq.com`) | `https://mcp.ap1.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` |
| **AP2** (`ap2.datadoghq.com`) | `https://mcp.ap2.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` |

### Example configurations

These examples are for the US1 site:

* **Command line**: For Claude Code, run:
  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http datadog-mcp https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp
  ```

* **Configuration file**: Edit the configuration file for your AI agent:
  * Codex CLI: `~/.codex/config.toml`
  * Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/settings.json`

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "datadog": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  * Amazon Q CLI: `~/.aws/amazonq/default.json`

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "datadog": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp",
        "oauthScopes": []
      }
    }
  }
  ```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Local binary authentication" %}}

This method uses the MCP specification's [stdio][1] transport mechanism to connect to the MCP Server.

Use this option if direct remote authentication is not available for you. After installation, you typically do not need to update the local binary to benefit from MCP Server updates, as the tools are remote.

1. Install the Datadog MCP Server binary:
    * macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      curl -sSL https://coterm.datadoghq.com/mcp-cli/install.sh | bash
      ```

      This installs the MCP Server binary to `~/.local/bin/datadog_mcp_cli` and then you can use it like any other stdio MCP server.<br/><br/>

    * Windows: Download the [Windows version][2].

2. Run `datadog_mcp_cli login` manually to walk through the OAuth login flow.

    The MCP Server automatically starts the OAuth flow if a client needs it, but doing it manually lets you choose a [Datadog site][3] and avoid the AI client timing out.

3. Configure your AI client to use the Datadog MCP Server. Follow your client's configuration instructions, as MCP Server setup varies between third-party AI clients.

    For example, for Claude Code, add this to `~/.claude.json`, making sure to replace `<USERNAME>` in the command path:

      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "datadog": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "/Users/<USERNAME>/.local/bin/datadog_mcp_cli",
            "args": [],
            "env": {}
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    Alternatively, you can also configure Claude Code by running the following:
      ```bash
      claude mcp add datadog --scope user -- ~/.local/bin/datadog_mcp_cli
      ```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Authentication

The MCP Server uses OAuth 2.0 for [authentication][2]. If you cannot go through the OAuth flow (for example, on a server), you can provide a Datadog [API key and application key][3] as `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_APPLICATION_KEY` HTTP headers. For example:

{{< code-block lang="json" >}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "datadog": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp",
      "headers": {
          "DD_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
          "DD_APPLICATION_KEY": "<YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
{{< /code-block >}}

### Test access to the MCP Server

1. Install the [MCP inspector][4], a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```
2. In the inspector's web UI, for **Transport Type**, select **Streamable HTTP**.
3. For **URL**, enter the [MCP Server URL](?tab=remoteauthentication#connect-in-supported-ai-clients) for your regional Datadog site.
4. Click **Connect**, then go to **Tools** > **List Tools**.
5. Check if the [available tools](#available-tools) appear.

## Toolsets

The Datadog MCP Server supports _toolsets_, which allow you to use only the tools you need, saving valuable context window space. These toolsets are available:

- `core`: The default toolset
- `synthetics`: Tools for interacting with Datadog [Synthetic tests][21]

To use a toolset, include the `toolsets` query parameter in the endpoint URL when connecting to the MCP Server ([remote authentication](?tab=remote-authentication#connect-in-supported-ai-clients) only). For example:

- `https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp` retrieves only the core tools (this is the default if `toolsets` is not specified).
- `https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp?toolsets=synthetics` retrieves only Synthetic Testing-related tools.
- `https://mcp.datadoghq.com/api/unstable/mcp-server/mcp?toolsets=core,synthetics` retrieves both core and Synthetic Testing tools.

## Available tools

## Context efficiency

The Datadog MCP Server is optimized to provide responses in a way that AI agents get relevant context without being overloaded with unnecessary information. For example:

- Responses are truncated based on the estimated length of responses each tool provides. The tools respond to AI agents with instructions on how to request more information if the response was truncated.
- Most tools have a `max_tokens` parameter that enables AI agents to request less or more information.

## Track tool calls in Audit Trail

You can view information about calls made by MCP Server tools in Datadog's [Audit Trail][17]. Search or filter by the event name `MCP Server`.

## Feedback

The Datadog MCP Server is under significant development. During the Preview, use [this feedback form][20] to share any feedback, use cases, or issues encountered with your prompts and queries.
