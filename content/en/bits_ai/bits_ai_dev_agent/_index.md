## Overview

{{< img src="bits_ai/dev_agent/error_tracking_assistant.png" alt="Bits AI Dev Agent suggesting a fix for an IndexError in a Django app" style="width:100%;">}}

Bits AI Dev Agent is a generative AI coding assistant that uses observability data from Datadog to automatically detect, diagnose, and fix high-impact issues in your code. It integrates with GitHub to create production-ready pull requests, iterates on fixes using CI logs and developer feedback, and draws on multiple Datadog products to generate contextual fixes.

## Supported Datadog products

Bits AI Dev Agent is available for the following Datadog products:

| Product                   | Availability          | Issues Detected                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Error Tracking][1]       | Preview              | Crashes, panics, exceptions, unhandled errors                      |
| [Code Security][2]        | Preview              | Security issues in first-party code and open source dependencies   |
| [Continuous Profiler][3]  | Preview              | Code-level performance issues                                      |
| [Test Optimization][4]    | Preview              | Flaky tests                                                        |

## Key capabilities

Bits AI Dev Agent provides comprehensive code remediation across multiple areas of your development workflow:

### Error tracking

Bits AI Dev Agent diagnoses and remediates code issues with automated context and unit-tested fixes:
- Determines whether an error can be fixed through code and generates unit tests.
- Provides links to relevant files and methods for streamlined navigation.
- Analyzes errors asynchronously as they arrive.
- Marks errors with a **Fix available** status and enables filtering to surface those issues.

### Flaky test remediation

Bits AI Dev Agent fixes unreliable tests in CI/CD pipelines and verifies that the tests remain stable.

### Trace investigation

Bits AI Dev Agent debugs errors and latency directly from traces using natural language queries:
- Parses and summarizes large traces.
- Diagnoses likely root causes.
- Generates code fixes for errors or latency issues within a trace.

### Code fix generation 

Bits AI Dev Agent applies automated code changes based on Datadog insights such as CCM Recommendations, APM Recommendations, and Profiling Insights.

### Code security

Bits AI Dev Agent remediates vulnerabilities at scale, from single issues to large backlogs. You can:
- Create PR batches to fix multiple vulnerabilities at once.
- Use the Campaign tool to push PRs incrementally and manage review workload across teams.

### Pull request assistance

Bits AI Dev Agent works in GitHub to request changes, fix CI failures, and respond to review comments:

- Generates PR titles and descriptions based on your PR template.
- Opens PRs as drafts, iterates using CI logs, and marks them ready for review when checks pass.
- Continues iterating in response to chat messages and review feedback.
  **Note**: Comment `@Datadog` to ask for updates to the PR. The Dev Agent never auto-merges PRs.

Go to **Bits AI** > **Dev Agent** > **[Code sessions][7]** to see all Dev Agent code sessions and generated PRs. You can search by service, source, and status.

### Bits AI SRE integration 

Bits AI Dev Agent generates fixes from SRE-led investigations. Learn more about [Bits AI SRE][8].

## Get started

To enable Bits AI Dev Agent:

1. Install the [GitHub integration][5].  
2. Grant the required permissions.  
3. Send CI logs to Datadog if you want the Dev Agent to iterate on PRs using build feedback.  

For full installation and configuration instructions, see [Setup][6].

## Limitations

- Bits AI Dev Agent is an AI-based product, which means outputs may vary for the same input and sometimes require human review. 
- Bits AI Dev Agent does not support multi-repository investigations.

## Security considerations

Observability data (such as traces, logs, and metrics) can include content from untrusted sources. Attackers might attempt to inject this data to influence agent behavior (for example, by injecting prompts that cause unintended code changes).

Datadog applies automated security and quality checks on agent output, but safeguards are limited and may not detect all malicious or unsafe code. Review and test all changes generated by the Dev Agent before merging them into production.
