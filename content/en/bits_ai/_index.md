<!-- ### Streamline incident management

Within [Datadog Incident Management][3], Bits AI can help you 

- **Stay informed:** Get an up-to-date summary of the incident when you join an incident Slack channel.
- **Engage responders:** Page on-call teams with PagerDuty with Slack queries like "`@DataDog` Page the team that owns example-service."
- **Update incidents:** Update the severity level and status of an incident.
- **Find related incidents**: Search through your entire incident history and find similar incidents to the one you're currently in.
- **Generate a postmortem:** Get a head start with a first draft, which you can then review and revise.

See [Coordinate Incidents][4] for details.
