## How Bits SRE investigates

Investigations happen in two phases:

1. **Initial context gathering**
   1. Bits begins by looking at any troubleshooting steps, Confluence pages, or Datadog links that you've added to the monitor's messageâ€”and making relevant queries. 
   1. It then automatically scans your Datadog environment for additional context.
   1. Thirdly, if you've interacted with a previous investigation for the same monitor, Bits will recall any memories associated with the monitor. 
   1. Initial findings are returned in under a minute. 
1. **Root cause hypothesis generation and testing**
   - Using the gathered context, Bits performs a more thorough investigation by building multiple root cause hypotheses and testing them in parallel. Today, Bits is able to query:
      - Metrics
      - Traces
      - Logs
      - Dashboards
      - Change events
      - Watchdog insights
   - Hypotheses can end in one of three states: validated, invalidated, or inconclusive.

## Help Bits SRE learn

Reviewing Bits' findings not only validates their accuracy, but also helps Bits learn from any mistakes it makes, helping it produce future investigations that are faster and more helpful.

### During the investigation
You can guide Bits' learning by:
- **Improving a step**: Share a link to a better query Bits should have made. 
- **Remembering a step**: Tell Bits to remember any helpful queries it generated. This instructs Bits to prioritize running these queries the next time the same monitor fires. 

### After the investigation
At the end of an investigation, let Bits know if the conclusion it made was correct or not. If it was inaccurate, provide Bits with the correct root cause so that it can learn from the discrepancy.

### Manage memories 
Every piece of feedback you give generates a **memory**. Bits uses these memories to enhance future investigations by recalling relevant patterns, queries, and corrections. You can navigate to [Bits-Enabled Monitors][3] to view and delete memories in the **Memories** column.
