This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and deploy the Datadog for Intune mobile app within your organization.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following requirements are met:

- You have admin permissions in **Intune, Azure, and Datadog**
- Users must download and install the **Datadog for Intune** app from their mobile app store or Microsoft Partner store.

For those looking to create a custom configuration using the mobile app bundle ID, see the links below:

| Platform   | Store Link                                                                                            | BundleID                    |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| iOS/iPadOS | [Datadog Intune on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/datadog-intune/id1673106321)             | com.datadog.flagship-intune |
| Android    | [Datadog Intune on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datadog.app.intune) | com.datadog.app.intune      |

## Initial Setup for Datadog for Intune
To get started, an Intune and Azure admin needs to configure the required settings. These are the **minimum** necessary steps to ensure Datadog for Intune functions correctly. Additional policies, such as those for configuration or conditional access, can be set up later.

### Step 1: Add Datadog for Intune to Microsoft Intune admin center
1. Open your [Microsoft Intune admin center][1], navigate to the **Apps** tab, and click **Add** under the appropriate **App type** (iOS/iPadOS or Android):
   - For iOS/iPadOS: Select **"iOS store app"**, then search for "Datadog Intune."
   - For Android: Select **"Android store app"**, then copy the required details from the [Google Play store page][2].
2. Assign the app to the relevant users and/or groups.

For additional guidance on adding an application to Intune, read Microsoft's [Intune Quickstart Guide][3].

### Step 2: Apply an app protection policy
To enable users to register and sign in securely, an **App Protection Policy** must be applied. This ensures access to the app is protected by Microsoft Intune security settings.

1. In the [admin center][1], go to the **Apps** tab and select **App Protection Policies**.
2. Create a policy for the appropriate platform (iOS and Android require separate policies).
3. Add **Datadog Intune** to the policy.
4. Configure your **security settings** and assign the policy to targeted users or groups.
5. Click **Save**.

**Note:** It may take some time for the new App Protection Policy to be applied to all devices. You can verify the setup by following [Microsoft's guidance][5].

### Step 3: Grant admin consent for your organization
In this step, switch from the Intune admin center to the Azure portal for Microsoft Entra-ID.

Admin consent is required before users can register successfully. Follow these steps:

1. Open [Microsoft Entra-ID][7] (formerly Azure Active Directory) and go to **Enterprise Applications**.
2. Search for **"Datadog"**:
   - If it isn't listed, click **Add**, then search for "Datadog" in the Microsoft Entra Gallery.
3. Select **Permissions**, then click **Grant admin consent for \<your organization name\>**.

For additional support with application management settings, see the [Microsoft documentation][8].

**Note:** If your organization has multiple "Datadog" applications configured, the one managing web and mobile app access has the Application ID **f21cb7e8-00ab-4b0e-aa94-b1e2f674606d**.

#### Datadog for Intune required permissions
Permissions are automatically added when configuring the application:

| Name                                    | Claim Value                              | Permission                                      | Type      |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Microsoft Graph                         | `User.Read`                              | Sign in and read user profile                   | Delegated |
| Microsoft Mobile Application Management | `DeviceManagementManagedApps.ReadWrite`  | Read and Write the User's App Management device | Delegated |

## Deploying Datadog Intune to mobile devices
When deploying to Android devices, users need to install the following:

- The [Microsoft Company Portal app][9]
- [Datadog - Intune][10]

For iOS devices, only [Datadog - Intune][11] is required, but the [Company Portal app][12] can be optionally installed.

On both platforms, the **Microsoft Authenticator app** can assist with sign-in if installed.

## Troubleshooting

### Device registration
If users encounter issues while registering their devices for Datadog Intune, administrators should verify the following configurations:

- The **admin consent** has been granted on Microsoft Entra-ID.
- An **App Protection Policy** is assigned to the user.
  - **Note**: It may take some time for policy updates to reach devices.
- If a dedicated **App Configuration Policy** exists, ensure it contains the correct keys and values.

If registration issues persist, contact us at [support@datadoghq.com][14] with the Intune Diagnostics attached. To collect diagnostics:

1. On the login screen, tap **View Intune Diagnostics.**
2. Select **Get Started** and then **Share Logs.**
