The Datadog Mobile app enables you to view alerts from Datadog on your mobile device. When receiving an alert through On-Call, Slack, or email, you can investigate issues by opening monitor graphs and dashboards on your mobile device.

## Installing

Download the app from the [Apple App Store][1] for your iOS device, or from the [Google Play store][2] for your Android device.

### Logging in

You can log in using standard authentication, Google authentication, or [SAML][3] - for both the US and the EU region.

#### Enabling SAML

SAML login requires you to set up and authenticate your SAML provider with Datadog using your default iOS/Android browser. For SAML IdP-initiated login, refer to the end of this section. To authenticate SAML:

1. In the mobile app, select your data center region (for example, US1) in the upper right corner.
2. Press the log-in button.
3. Click the "Using Single Sign-On (SAML)?" link.
4. Enter your company email and send the email.
5. While on your mobile device, open the email and click on the indicated link through your default browser.
6. Enter your org's SAML credentials to be rerouted to an authenticated session of the Datadog mobile app.

Optionally, you may also authenticate through a QR Code or manual entry, outlined below.

##### QR code

1. In a browser, navigate to your [Datadog account Personal Settings Organizations][4] page and click **Log in to Mobile App** for the organization you are currently logged into. This pops up a QR code.
2. Use your default phone camera app to scan the QR code and then tap the suggested link to open the Datadog App. You will be automatically logged in.

**Note**: If you click the **Log in to Mobile App** button of an organization you are not currently logged into, the org UUID is automatically inserted into the login screen. You still have to provide authentication using your standard method.

##### Manual entry

1. To manually enter the SAML ID, open the Datadog Mobile app and press the "Using Single Sign-On (SAML)?" button.
2. Press the "Use another method to login" button, and enter the SAML ID manually.

By clicking **Authorize** when logging in, you link the mobile device you're using to your account. For security purposes, you will have to go through this flow once per month.

##### SAML IdP initiated login

If you keep getting errors while trying to login with SAML, your identity provider may enforce IdP-initiated login. For more information regarding enabling IdP initiated SAML, please see our IdP initiated SAML page [IdP Initiated SAML page][5]

### Switch organizations

To switch organizations, navigate to the **Settings** page on the mobile app and click on **Organization**. 

**Note**: You may need to reauthenticate when you switch organizations.

### Log out
To log out, navigate to the **Settings** page on the mobile app and click on **Log Out**. Confirm **Yes** that you are sure.

The On-Call page provides a comprehensive view of On-Call shifts, schedules, pages, and escalation policies. You can filter the information by user, team, urgency, status, or date to quickly find relevant details. Tapping **Escalate** prompts you to confirm the escalation to the next policy level. Tapping **Declare Incident** prompts you to enter a title and provide relevant incident attributes.

You can initiate a page to an individual or team, and also override existing shifts when necessary. For additional details, refer to the [Datadog On-Call documentation][20].

To configure On-Call notifications on your mobile device, see the guide to [Set up your Mobile Device for Datadog On-Call][21].

{{< /tabs >}}

On the Dashboards page, you can view and search all of the dashboards that you have access to in your Datadog org, and filter them using the same template variables you have set up in the Datadog web app. Quickly filter your dashboards using template variable saved views. For more information about template variable saved views, see [Dashboard Saved Views][9]. Click on an individual dashboard to view it. Click timeframe on bottom right to customize the dashboard range. 

**Notes**: 
- To set up or edit a dashboard, you need to [log in to the Datadog browser app][10]. For more information, see [Dashboards][11].
- Dashboard links configured in UTC open in UTC on the mobile app. For more information, see [Dashboard Configurations][24].

## Monitors

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

On the Monitors page, you can view and search all of the monitors that you have access to in your Datadog org. You can specify by field name and build-specific search queries based on your tagging strategy. For more information about search, see the [Manage Monitors Search section][6].

For example, to filter on metric monitors related to the SRE team that is being alerted, use the query `"status:Alert type:Metric team:sre"`. Click into individual alerts to see details, which can be filtered by type and by alert time. You can also mute the alert. Your ten most recent searches are saved so that you have faster access to previous queries. Furthermore, you can filter your monitor list using saved views, which surface when you activate the search bar. You can also view and run synthetic tests when viewing your synthetic monitors.

**Note**: To set up or edit monitors, notifications, or saved views, you must use the [Datadog web app][7]. All monitors set up in the web app are visible in the mobile app. For more information, see [Creating monitors][8].

## Frequently Asked Question
### How do I remain logged into the mobile app?
Upon successful authentication to the mobile app, you will remain logged in for 90 days. Provided you are active during that 90 day period, the token will be refreshed.

### Will I still receive notifications if I am automatically signed out?
If you are automatically logged out due to inactivity during the 90 day token period, you will still be able to receive notifications and will be prompted to log in again.

**Note**: If you manually log out from the app, you will stop receiving notifications.

### Why am I not receiving notifications?
Check that you have notifications enabled for the Datadog app in your device app settings. If you would like to ensure that notifications bypass Do Not Disturb, check that Critical Alerts is toggled on.

## Troubleshooting

For help with troubleshooting, [contact Datadog support][13]. You can also send a message in the [Datadog public Slack][14] [#mobile-app][15] channel.
