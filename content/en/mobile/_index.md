The Datadog Mobile app enables you to view alerts from Datadog on your mobile device. When receiving an alert via Slack, e-mail, Pagerduty or other pager apps, you'll be able to investigate issues by opening monitor graphs and dashboards on your mobile device.

## Installing

Download the app from the [Apple App Store][1] for your iOS device, or from the [Google Play store][2] for your Android device.

### Logging in

You can log in using standard authentication, Google authentication, or [SAML][3] - for both the US and the EU region.

#### Enabling SAML

SAML login requires you to set up and authenticate your SAML provider with Datadog. Before trying to login with SAML, 

1. Start by logging in to your [Datadog account profile page][4] in a browser and click the **Link mobile device** button of the organization you want to log into. This pops up a QR code.

2. Use your default phone camera app to scan the QR code and then tap the suggested link to open the Datadog App. The org UDID is automatically inserted into the login screen.
3. Optionally, you can manually enter the SAML ID by opening the Datadog Mobile app, clicking **login with SAML**, and entering the SAML ID manually.
4. Now log in using your normal SAML login flow. By clicking **Authorize** when logging in, you link this mobile device to your account. For security purposes, you will have to go through this flow once per month.

**Note**: The mobile app does not currently support IdP-initiated login (authentication starting from the SAML identity provider). Contact [Datadog Support][5] for more information or if you have any issues with SAML authentication.

## Monitors

{{< img src="mobile/monitors_doc2.png" alt="monitor page">}}

On the Monitors page, you can view and search all of the monitors that you have access to in your Datadog org. You can specify by field name and build-specific search queries based on your tagging strategy. For more information about search, see the [Manage Monitors Search section][6]. For example, to filter on metric monitors related to the SRE team that is being alerted, use the query `"status:Alert type:Metric team:sre"`. Click into individual alerts to see details, which can be filtered by type and by alert time. You can also mute the alert. Your ten most recent searches are saved so that you have faster access previous queries.

**Note:** To set up or edit monitors and notifications, you need to do it in the [Datadog web app][7]. All monitors set up in the web app are visible in the mobile app. For more information, see [Creating monitors][8].

## Dashboards

{{< img src="mobile/dashboards_doc.png" alt="dashboard page">}}

On the Dashboards page, you can view and search all of the dashboards that you have access to in your Datadog org, and filter them using the same template variables you have set up in the Datadog web app. Click on an individual dashboard to view it.

**Note:** To set up or edit a dashboard, you need to [login to the Datadog browser app][9]. For more information, see [Dashboards][5]. 

## Quick Actions

{{< img src="mobile/quick-actions-final.png" alt="Quick Actions">}}

Long-press on the app icon to surface a quick-action sheet of your top five [Frequently Viewed By Me][10] dashboards for iOS (measured by view count and recency) and your five most opened dashboards on mobile for Android. Press on a result to open the dashboard in-app.

## Home Screen Search

{{< img src="mobile/home-screen-search-2.png" alt="Home Screen Search" style="width:40%;">}}

**iOS only**: Within iPhone Search, filter and search for the name of any desired dashboard. Press on a result to open the dashboard view directly on the mobile app, or press the “Search in App” button to open the search query in the in-app Dashboard List page.

## Siri Shortcuts and Suggestions

**iOS Only**: You can create Siri Shortcuts for Datadog dashboards and monitors. To do so, create a shortcut through the Shortcuts App. For a shortcut to be available to create, you must first execute the desired action at least once in the app. For example, to create an “Open AWS Overview Dashboard” shortcut, you must first open the AWS Overview Dashboard in your mobile app at least once.

With the shortcut, you can access your dashboards and monitors through three key actions:

* Pin the shortcut as an icon in your home screen. To do so, access the Shortcuts app, and open the edit menu for your dashboard shortcut.
* Siri Voice: say your shortcut name, such as “Open AWS Overview”, and Siri opens your dashboard in-app.
* Siri suggestions: Siri learns your routine, and suggests dashboard shortcuts when you most need them, through a home or lock-screen banner, iPhone search, or iOS 14 Siri Suggestions widget.
