title: Plaintext Markdown Spec
---

## What is this?

This folder contains a listing of the components used on the docs site, and a description of their desired output format in the plaintext files generated for AI agents.

The HTML compiled from these files will be used as the test input HTML for the Markdown generator job.

## Where can I learn more?

1. Read [Datadog Docs for AI Agents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t48N0uDJElMP_228n2bIYi_cUIj_xMOKjdHuh1Z4rMg), which attempts to summarize the problem space and why this is important.
2. Ask Jen Gilbert.

## Disclaimer

Everything described here is *probably* possible based on the technical context and existing libraries we have so far, but it's not *guaranteed* to be possible until the docs are migrated to Markdoc.

If you'd like to follow along with changes in the spec, Jen will keep this PR up to date, with clear commit messages about what changed.

## Feedback is welcome!

Jen took her best shot at these, but she's not attached to any of it. Comment away!
