The Datadog Real User Monitoring SDK generates six types of events:

| Event Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Session][1]    | A user session begins when a user starts browsing the web application. It contains high-level information about the user (browser, device, geolocation). It aggregates all RUM events collected during the user journey with a unique `session.id` attribute. |
| [View][2]       | Each time a user goes on a page of the setup application, a view event is created. While the user remains on that view, all data collected is attached to that view with the `view.id` attribute.                                                             |
| [Resource][3]   | A resource event can be generated for images, XHR/Fetch, CSS, or JS libraries. It contains information about the resource, like its name and its associated loading duration.                                                                                 |
| [Long Task][4]  | Any task in a browser that blocks the main thread for more than 50ms is considered a long task and gets a specific event generation.                                                                                                                          |
| [Error][5]     | Every time a frontend error is emitted by the browser, RUM catches it and sends it as an Error Event to Datadog.                                                                                                                                              |
| [Action][6]     | A User Action event is a custom event that can be generated for a given user action.                                                                                                                                                                          |

The following diagram illustrates the RUM event hierarchy:

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/data_collected/event-hierarchy.png" alt="RUM Event hierarchy" style="width:50%;border:none" >}}

## Event-specific and default attributes

There are metrics and attributes that are specific to a given event type. For example, the metric `view.loading_time` is associated with "view" RUM events and the attribute `resource.method` is associated with "resource" RUM events. And there are [default attributes](#default-attributes) that are present on all RUM events. For example, the URL of the page (`view.url`) and user information such as their device type (`device.type`) and their country (`geo.country`).

## Event-specific attributes

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Session" %}}

A RUM session represents a real user journey on your web application. It begins when the user starts browsing the application and it is kept live as long as the user stays active. During the user journey, all RUM events generated as part of the session will share the same `session.id` attribute.

A page view represents a user visiting a page from your website. During that page view, [errors][1], [resources][2], [long tasks][3], and [user actions][4] get attached to that page view with a unique `view.id` attribute. Note that a page view gets updated as new events are collected.

For page views, loading performance metrics are collected from both the [Paint Timing API][5] and the [Navigation Timing API][6].

### Single page applications

For single page applications (SPAs), the RUM SDK differentiates between `initial_load` and `route_change` navigations with the `loading_type` attribute. If a click on your web page leads to a new page without a full refresh of the page, the RUM SDK starts a new view event with `loading_type:route_change`. RUM tracks page changes using the [History API][7].

Datadog provides a unique performance metric, `loading_time`, which calculates the time needed for a page to load. This metric works both for `initial_load` and `route_change` navigations.

#### How is loading time calculated?
To account for modern web applications, loading time watches for network requests and DOM mutations.

* **Initial Load**: Loading Time is equal to *whichever is longer*:

    - The difference between `navigationStart` and `loadEventEnd`.
    - Or the difference between `navigationStart` and the first time the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity being defined as ongoing network requests or a DOM mutation).

* **SPA Route Change**: Loading Time is equal to the difference between the user click and the first time the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity being defined as ongoing network requests, or a DOM mutation).

#### Hash SPA navigation

Frameworks relying on hash (`#`) navigation are monitored with the RUM SDK automatically. The SDK watches for `HashChangeEvent` and issues a new view. Events coming from an HTML anchor tag which do not affect the current view context are ignored.

### View timing metrics

[Long tasks][1] are tasks that block the main thread for 50 milliseconds or more. They may cause high input latency, delayed time to interaction, etc. Understand what causes these long tasks in your browser performance profiler.

### Long task timing metrics

| Metric  | Type   | Description                |
|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| `long_task.duration` | number | Duration of the long task. |

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Error" %}}

Front-end errors are collected with Real User Monitoring (RUM). The error message and stack trace are included when available.

### Error origins
Front-end errors are split in 4 different categories depending on their `error.origin`:

- **network**: XHR or Fetch errors resulting from AJAX requests. Specific attributes to network errors can be found [in the documentation][1].
- **source**: Unhandled exceptions or unhandled promise rejections (source-code related).
- **console**: `console.error()` API calls.
- **custom**: Errors sent with the [RUM `addError` API][2] default to `custom`.

### Error attributes

| Attribute       | Type   | Description                                                       |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Automatic collection of actions
Real User Monitoring (RUM) SDKs detect user interactions performed during a user journey. Set the `trackInteractions` [initialization parameter][1] to `true` to enable this feature.

**Note**:  The `trackInteractions` initialization parameter enables the collection of user clicks in your application. **Sensitive and private data** contained on your pages may be included to identify the elements interacted with.

Once an interaction is detected, all new RUM events are attached to the ongoing action until it is considered finished. The action also benefits from its parent view attributes such as browser information, geolocation data, [global context][2].

#### How is the action loading time calculated?
Once an interaction is detected, the RUM SDK watches for network requests an DOM mutations. It is considered finished once the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity being defined as ongoing network requests or DOM mutations).

### Custom user actions
Custom user actions are user actions declared and sent manually via the [`addUserAction` API][3]. They can send information relative to an event occurring during a user journey, for example, a custom timing or customer cart information.

### Action timing metrics

| Metric    | Type   | Description              |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------|
| `action.loading_time` | number (ns) | The loading time of the action. See how it is calculated in the [User Action documentation][4]. |
| `action.long_task.count`        | number      | Count of all long tasks collected for this action. |
| `action.resource.count`         | number      | Count of all resources collected for this action. |
| `action.error.count`      | number      | Count of all errors collected for this action.|

### Action attributes

| Attribute    | Type   | Description              |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------|
| `action.id` | string | UUID of the user action. |
| `action.type` | string | Type of the user action. For [Custom User Actions][5], it is set to `custom`. |
| `action.target.name` | string | Element that the user interacted with. Only for automatically collected actions |
| `action.name` | string | User-friendly name created (for example `Click on #checkout`). For [Custom User Actions][5], the action name given in the API call. |

## Extra attribute

In addition to default attributes, add [specific global context][8] to all events collected. This provides the ability to analyze the data for a subset of users. For example, group errors by user email, or understand which customers have the worst performance.

## Data retention
By default, all data collected is kept at full granularity for 15 days.
