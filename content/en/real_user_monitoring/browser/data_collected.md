The Datadog Real User Monitoring SDK generates six types of events:

| Event Type     | Retention | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session   | 30 days   | A user session begins when a user starts browsing the web application. It contains high-level information about the user (browser, device, geolocation). It aggregates all RUM events collected during the user journey with a unique `session.id` attribute. |
| View      | 30 days   | A view event is generated each time a user visits a page of the web application. While the user remains on the same page, resource, long-task, error and action events are linked to the related RUM view with the `view.id` attribute.                       |
| Resource  | 15 days   | A resource event is generated for images, XHR, Fetch, CSS, or JS libraries loaded on a webpage. It includes detailed loading timing information.                                                                                                              |
| Long Task | 15 days   | A long task event is generated for any task in the browser that blocks the main thread for more than 50ms.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Error     | 30 days   | RUM collects every frontend error emitted by the browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Action    | 30 days   | RUM action events track user interactions during a user journey and can also be manually sent to monitor custom user actions.                                                                                                                                 |

The following diagram illustrates the RUM event hierarchy:

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/data_collected/event-hierarchy.png" alt="RUM Event hierarchy" style="width:50%;border:none" >}}

## Event-specific and default attributes

There are metrics and attributes that are specific to a given event type. For example, the metric `view.loading_time` is associated with "view" RUM events and the attribute `resource.method` is associated with "resource" RUM events. And there are [default attributes](#default-attributes) that are present on all RUM events. For example, the URL of the page (`view.url`) and user information such as their device type (`device.type`) and their country (`geo.country`).
## Default attributes

Each of these event types has the following attributes attached by default. So you can use them regardless of the RUM event type being queried.

## User attributes

### Single page applications

For single page applications (SPAs), the RUM SDK differentiates between `initial_load` and `route_change` navigations with the `loading_type` attribute. If a click on your web page leads to a new page without a full refresh of the page, the RUM SDK starts a new view event with `loading_type:route_change`. RUM tracks page changes using the [History API][1].

Datadog provides a unique performance metric, `loading_time`, which calculates the time needed for a page to load. This metric works both for `initial_load` and `route_change` navigations.

#### How is loading time calculated?
To account for modern web applications, loading time watches for network requests and DOM mutations.

* **Initial Load**: Loading Time is equal to *whichever is longer*:

    - The difference between `navigationStart` and `loadEventEnd`.
    - Or the difference between `navigationStart` and the first time the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity being defined as ongoing network requests or a DOM mutation).

* **SPA Route Change**: Loading Time is equal to the difference between the user click and the first time the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity being defined as ongoing network requests, or a DOM mutation).

#### Hash SPA navigation

Frameworks relying on hash (`#`) navigation are monitored with the RUM SDK automatically. The SDK watches for `HashChangeEvent` and issues a new view. Events coming from an HTML anchor tag which do not affect the current view context are ignored.

### View timing metrics

RUM view performance metrics are collected from both the [Paint Timing API][2] and the [Navigation Timing API][3].

### Resource timing metrics

Detailed network timing data for the loading of an application’s resources are collected with the [Performance Resource Timing API][1].

### Error sources
Front-end errors are split in 4 different categories depending on their `error.source`:

- **network**: XHR or Fetch errors resulting from AJAX requests.
- **source**: Unhandled exceptions or unhandled promise rejections (source-code related).
- **console**: `console.error()` API calls.
- **custom**: Errors sent with the [RUM `addError` API][1] default to `custom`.

{{% tab "User Action" %}}

### Automatic collection of actions
Real User Monitoring (RUM) SDKs detect user interactions performed during a user journey. Set the `trackInteractions` [initialization parameter][1] to `true` to enable this feature.

**Note**:  The `trackInteractions` initialization parameter enables the collection of user clicks in your application. **Sensitive and private data** contained on your pages may be included to identify the elements interacted with.

Once an interaction is detected, all new RUM events are attached to the ongoing action until it is considered finished. The action also benefits from its parent view attributes such as browser information, geolocation data, [global context][2].

#### How is the action loading time calculated?
Once an interaction is detected, the RUM SDK watches for network requests an DOM mutations. It is considered finished once the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity being defined as ongoing network requests or DOM mutations).

### Custom user actions
Custom user actions are user actions declared and sent manually via the [`addUserAction` API][3]. They can send information relative to an event occurring during a user journey, for example, a custom timing or customer cart information.

### Action timing metrics

| Metric    | Type   | Description              |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------|
| `action.loading_time` | number (ns) | The loading time of the action. See how it is calculated in the [User Action documentation][4]. |
| `action.long_task.count`        | number      | Count of all long tasks collected for this action. |
| `action.resource.count`         | number      | Count of all resources collected for this action. |
| `action.error.count`      | number      | Count of all errors collected for this action.|

### Action attributes

| Attribute    | Type   | Description              |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------|
| `action.id` | string | UUID of the user action. |
| `action.type` | string | Type of the user action. For [Custom User Actions][3], it is set to `custom`. |
| `action.target.name` | string | Element that the user interacted with. Only for automatically collected actions |
| `action.name` | string | User-friendly name created (for example `Click on #checkout`). For [Custom User Actions][3], the action name given in the API call. |
