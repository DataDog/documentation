## Performance metrics for views

RUM view events collect extensive performance metrics for every single page view. Datadog recommends analyzing the performance metrics in the following ways:
- **Dashboards**: provides you with a high-level view of your application's performance. For example, the out-of-the-box [Performance Overview dashboard][1] can be filtered on [default attributes][2] collected by RUM to surface issues impacting a subset of users. This dashboard can be cloned and customized to your specific needs. All [RUM performance metrics](#all-performance-metrics) can be used in dashboard queries.
- **RUM waterfall**: accessible for every single RUM view event in the [RUM Explorer][3], it lets you troubleshoot the performance of a specific page view. It shows how your website assets and resources, long tasks, and frontend errors affect performance for your end users, at the page level.

### Core web vitals
<div class="alert alert-warning"> 
  <strong>Note:</strong>The core web vitals metrics are available in Datadog from the <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/browser-sdk">@datadog/browser-rum</a> package v2.0.0+.
</div>

[Google's Core Web Vitals][4] are a set of three metrics designed to monitor a site's user experience. These metrics focus on giving you a view of load performance, interactivity, and visual stability. Each metric comes with guidance on the range of values that translate to good user experience. Datadog recommends monitoring the 75th percentile for these metrics.

## Monitoring single page applications (SPA)

For single page applications (SPAs), the RUM SDK differentiates between `initial_load` and `route_change` navigation with the `loading_type` attribute. If a click on your web page leads to a new page without a full refresh of the page, the RUM SDK starts a new view event with `loading_type:route_change`. RUM tracks page changes using the [History API][15].

Datadog provides a unique performance metric, `loading_time`, which calculates the time needed for a page to load. This metric works for both `initial_load` and `route_change` navigation.

### How is loading time calculated?

To account for modern web applications, loading time watches for network requests and DOM mutations.

- **Initial Load**: Loading Time is equal to _whichever is longer_:

  - The difference between `navigationStart` and `loadEventEnd`.
  - Or the difference between `navigationStart` and the first time the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity defined as ongoing network requests or a DOM mutation).

- **SPA Route Change**: Loading Time is equal to the difference between the user click and the first time the page has no activity for more than 100ms (activity defined as ongoing network requests or a DOM mutation).

### Hash SPA navigation

The RUM SDK automatically monitors frameworks that rely on hash (`#`) navigation. The SDK watches for `HashChangeEvent` and issues a new view. Events coming from an HTML anchor tag which do not affect the current view context are ignored.

## Add your own performance timing
On top of RUM's default performance timing, you may measure where your application is spending its time with greater flexibility. The `addTiming` API provides you with a simple way to add extra performance timing. For example, you can add a timing when your hero image has appeared:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <img onload="DD_RUM.addTiming('hero_image')" src="/path/to/img.png" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Or when users first scroll:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("scroll", function handler() {
    //Remove the event listener so that it only triggers once
    document.removeEventListener("scroll", handler);
    DD_RUM.addTiming('first_scroll');
});
```

Once the timing is sent, the timing will be accessible as `@view.custom_timings.<timing_name>` (For example, `@view.custom_timings.first_scroll`). You must [create a measure][16] before graphing it in RUM analytics or in dashboards.

**Note**: For Single Page Applications, the `addTiming` API issues a timing relative to the start of the current RUM view. For example, if a user lands on your application (initial load), then goes on a different page after 5 seconds (route change) and finally triggers `addTiming` after 8 seconds, the timing will equal 8-5 = 3 seconds.
