## Overview

To get started with Datadog RUM Browser, you need to:

1. Create an application in Datadog.
2. Instrument your application.

Instrumenting your application allows observability data from your application to be displayed in the Datadog UI.

## Instrumentation types

There are two ways to instrument your application: automatic or manual instrumentation.

| | Auto-instrumentation (Preview) | Client-side (Manual) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **SDK setup mechanism** | [Automatically][1] add RUM JS to your web app HTML. Once RUM Auto-instrumentation is set-up, manage configurations from the UI.
| [Manually][2] add the RUM SDK to your application code and manage configurations in code. |
| **Code changes required?** | No | Yes |
| **Setup complexity** | Low | Medium |
| **User personas** | **SRE and engineering teams** without access to frontend code, or **teams who need to manage** all observability needs centrally, may find this useful for: <br> - Unlocking performance data across all applications upon setting up RUM <br> - Holistically monitoring application performance across the organization | **Frontend engineering, mobile engineering, or product teams** with access to frontend code may find this method useful for: <br> - Daily engineering needs (for example: live support, troubleshooting, and health checks for downstream services) <br> -Product needs (for example: user flow analysis, user segmentation, and feature flag tracking) <br> - Capturing observability from in-house code or complex functions that aren't captured by automatic instrumentation |
