The RUM Browser SDK collects resources and assets for every RUM view (page load): [XMLHttpRequest][1] (XHRs) and Fetch requests, but also images, CSS files, JavaScript assets, and font files. A RUM Resource event is generated for each one of them, with detailed timings and metadata.

RUM Resources inherit from all the context related to the active RUM View at the time of collection.

## Link RUM Resources to APM traces

To get even more complete, end-to-end visibility into requests as they move across layers of your stack, connect your RUM data with corresponding backend traces. This enables you to:

* Locate backend problems that resulted in a user-facing error.
* Identify the extent to which users are affected by an issue within your stack.
* See complete end-to-end requests on the flame graphs, allowing you to seamlessly navigate between RUM and APM and back with precise context.

See [Connect RUM and Traces][2] for information about setting up this feature.

## Resource timing and metrics

Detailed network timing data for resources is collected from the Fetch and XHR native browser methods and from the [Performance Resource Timing API][3].

| Attribute                      | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `resource.duration`            | number         | Entire time spent loading the resource.                                                                                                    |
| `resource.size`                | number (bytes) | Resource size.                                                                                                                             |

| `resource.redirect.duration`   | number (ns)    | Time spent on subsequent HTTP requests (redirectEnd - redirectStart).                                                                      |
| `resource.first_byte.duration` | number (ns)    | Time spent waiting for the first byte of response to be received (responseStart - RequestStart).                                           |
| `resource.download.duration`   | number (ns)    | Time spent downloading the response (responseEnd - responseStart).                                                                         |

**Note**: If you are having trouble collecting detailed timing for some resources, see [Cross origin resources](#cross-origin-resources).

## Resource attributes

| Attribute                  | Type   | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resource.type`            | string | The type of resource being collected (for example, `css`, `javascript`, `media`, `XHR`, `image`). |
| `resource.method`          | string | The HTTP method (for example `POST`, `GET`).                                                      |
| `resource.status_code`     | number | The response status code.                                                                         |
| `resource.url`             | string | The resource URL.                                                                                 |

| `resource.url_path`        | string | The path part of the URL.                                                                         |
| `resource.url_query`       | object | The query string parts of the URL decomposed as query params key/value attributes.                |
| `resource.url_scheme`      | string | The protocol name of the URL (HTTP or HTTPS).                                                     |

| `resource.provider.type`   | string | The resource provider type (for example `first-party`, `cdn`, `ad`, `analytics`).                 |

**Note**: Some fields may not be available in all browsers. For example, `resource.status_code` is not available in Safari, see [Browser Compatibility][3].

## Identify third-party resources

RUM infers the name and category of the resource provider from the resource URL host part. If the resource URL host matches the current page URL host, the category is set to `first party`. Otherwise, the category will be `cdn`, `analytics`, or `social` for example.

## Cross origin resources

Certain resource timings and attributes are collected using the [Resource Timing API][4]. However, when a resource originates from a different URL than the current page (for example, a web application hosted on `www.example.com` loading resources from `static.example.com`), the browser's security policy restricts access to some of this information.

### Resource timings

To collect detailed resource timings, add the `Timing-Allow-Origin` HTTP response header to your cross-origin resources. For example, to grant access to the resource timing to any origin, use `Timing-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information about CORS, see [Cross-origin timing information][5] in the MDN Web Docs.

### Resource status code

To collect the resource status code, add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP response header and the `crossorigin` attribute to the relevant HTML tags to allow access to cross-origin resources. For example, to grant access to the resource status code to any origin, use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and add `crossorigin="anonymous"` to your HTML tags. For more information, see [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header][6], and [`crossorigin` attribute][7] in the MDN Web Docs.
