## Overview

Ownership of views lets you see only the RUM metrics and events for the parts of your application that your team is responsible for. After you've set up ownership of views, every RUM event and metric attached to those views is **tagged** with your team's name. You can turn this filter on or off using the **My Teams** toggle on the Summary, Optimization, and Session Explorer pages.

By default, the toggle is enabled, which filters metrics and event data to show only the one coming from views your team owns. If you belong to multiple teams, you can enable or disable specific team filters. The teams that own a view are also listed in the top-right corner of all event side panels.

## Setup

<div class="alert alert-info">To use this feature, your organization must have teams enabled and configured. </div>

To configure team ownership for your application's views:

1. In Datadog, navigate to the [**Digital Experience > Manage Applications**][1] page and select your application.
2. In the left navigation menu, select "Team Ownership".
3. For each selected view, click "Edit Teams" and select one or more teams. This attributes each view in your application to those teams.

After you associate a view with a team, Datadog automatically attributes new event data to that team.

<div class="alert alert-warning">If you change a team and view mapping, any past metrics or events are not retroactively tagged with the new team.</div>
