## Overview

Real User Monitoring (RUM) Analytics extend the RUM Explorer page with views data aggregation and split capabilities for troubleshooting and monitoring. You can control:

* The query that filters the set of views to analyze.
* The dimensions over which to split data.
* The visualization method for aggregates and splits.

With RUM Analytics visualizations, you can:

* Create a widget in a dashboard out of that visualization.
* Dive deeper into subsets of the events list depending on the interactions that the visualization enables.

## Build a query

In [RUM Analytics][1], customize your display by adding facets and measures to your search query. 

1. Choose a measure or facet to graph. A measure lets you choose the aggregation function, whereas a facet displays the unique count.

2. Select the aggregation function for the measure you want to graph:

3. Use a facet to split your graph.

4. Choose the time interval for your graph. Changing the global timeframe changes the list of available timestep values.

5. Choose to display either the **top** or **bottom** values according to the selected measure.
