The Real User Monitoring (RUM) Explorer allow you to explore all your views collected from your different applications.

## Context

Build up a context to explore your views in your RUM Explorer page first by selecting the proper [time range](#time-range), and then by using the [search bar][1] to filter your views and analytics.

### Time Range

The time range appears directly under the search bar as a timeline. This feature allows you to display views in the view steam or analytics within a given time period.

Quickly change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown:

All of the search parameters are contained within the URL. You can share your view by sharing the URL.

## Visualization

Click on any view to open the views panel and see more details (resources, traces, errors, user actions, long tasks, logs, or attributes) about it:

## Setup - Facets & Measures

After [being collected][2], your views attributes can be indexed as facets or measures in order to be accessible for your [context](#context) creation and [analytics][3].

Note: to leverage the most out from your RUM Explorer page, make sure your views attributes follow [Datadog attribute naming convention][4].

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Facets" %}}

A facet displays all the distinct members of an attribute or a tag and provides some basic analytics, such as the number of views represented. Facets allow you to pivot or filter your datasets based on a given attribute. To filter, select the values that you want to see.

**Create a Facet**:

To start using an attribute as a facet or in the search, click on it and add it as a facet:

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/explorer/create_facet.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Create Facet"  style="width:30%;">}}

Once this is done, the value of this attribute is stored **for all new views** and can be used in [the search bar][1], the facets panel, and in the [RUM Analytics query][2].

[2]: /real_user_monitoring/rum_analytics/
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Measures" %}}

A measure is an attribute with a numerical value contained in your views.

**Create a Measure**:

To start using an attribute as a measure, click on a numerical attribute of your views:

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/explorer/create_measure.png" alt="Create a measure"  style="width:30%;">}}

Once this is done, the value of this attribute is stored **for all new views** and can be used in [the search bar][1], the facets panel, and in the [RUM Analytics query][2].

**Select the Measure Unit**:

Each measure has its own unit that is then used for display in the RUM Explorer columns and RUM Analytics.
