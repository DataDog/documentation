## Overview

The [Real User Monitoring (RUM) Explorer][1] allows you to examine data collected from your applications and granular information about your RUM events.

You can:

- Navigate through user sessions
- Investigate performance issues affecting views, resources, or actions
- Troubleshoot application errors and long tasks

## View by application

Use the application selector in the top navigation to select and view all RUM data for a specific application.

## Search and filter

Search and filter your RUM events by typing in the search bar and selecting a visualization type in the [RUM Explorer][1]. You can narrow down, broaden, and shift your focus on subsets of events you are interested in.

## Group

Group the RUM events you have queried into higher-level entities that may help you derive or consolidate information about an issue. To identify event patterns and aggregate events by subsets, see [Group RUM Events][2]. 

To start creating queries and using facets, see [Search Syntax][3]. 

## Visualize 

Select a visualization for your filters and aggregations that displays your RUM events in a helpful perspective for you to uncover decisive information. 

For example, you can view RUM events in a list, organize RUM data into columns, and see RUM data in a timeseries graph that displays your RUM metrics data over time. 

To start visualizing RUM data in the RUM Explorer, see [Create RUM Visualizations][4].
