## Overview

If your front-end Javascript source code is minified, you will need to upload your source maps to Datadog so that we are able to deobfuscate your different stack traces. For a given error, you will then get access to the file path, the line number, as well as a code snippet for each frame of the related stack trace.

## Instrument your code
You must configure your Javascript bundler so that, when minifying your source code, it generates source maps which directly include the related source code in the `sourcesContent` attribute. In addition, ensure that the size of each source map augmented with the size of the related minified file does not exceed __our limit of 50MB__. Check below for some configurations for popular Javascript bundlers.

{{% tab "WebpackJS" %}}

You can generate source maps by using the built-in webpack plugin named [SourceMapDevToolPlugin][1]. Check below how to configure it in your `webpack.config.js` file:

```javascript
// ...
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  devtool: false,
  plugins: [
    new webpack.SourceMapDevToolPlugin({
      noSources: false,
      filename: '[name].[fullhash].js.map'
    }),
    // ...
  ],
  optimization: {
    minimize: true,
    // ...
  },
  // ...
};
```

**Note**: If you are using TypeScript, make sure to set `compilerOptions.sourceMap` to `true` when configuring your `tsconfig.json` file.

Parcel generates source maps by default when you run the build command: `parcel build <entry file>`

After building your application, bundlers generate a directory, most of the time named `dist`, with minified Javascript files colocated with their corresponding source maps. Check an example below:

```bash
./dist
    javascript.364758.min.js
    javascript.364758.js.map
    ./subdirectory
        javascript.464388.min.js
        javascript.464388.js.map
```

<div class="alert alert-info">If, for example, the sum of the file size of <code>javascript.364758.min.js</code> and <code>javascript.364758.js.map</code> exceeds <i>the 50MB limit</i>, reduce it by configuring your bundler to split the source code into multiple smaller chunks (<a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">See how to do this with WebpackJS</a>).</div>

## Upload your source maps

The best way to upload source maps is to add an extra-step in your CI pipeline and to run the dedicated command from the [Datadog CLI][1]. It scans the `dist` directory and its subdirectories to automatically upload the source maps with their related minified files. The flow is the following:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "US" %}}

1. Add `@datadog/datadog-ci` to your `package.json` file (make sure to use the latest version).
2. [Create a new and dedicated Datadog API key][1] and export it as an environment variable named `DATADOG_API_KEY`.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
datadog-ci sourcemaps upload /path/to/dist \
	--service=my-service \
	--release-version=v35.2395005 \
	--minified-path-prefix=https://hostname.com/static/js
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "EU" %}}

1. Add `@datadog/datadog-ci` to your `package.json` file (make sure to use the latest version).
2. [Create a new and dedicated Datadog API key][1] and export it as an environment variable named `DATADOG_API_KEY`.
3. Configure the CLI to upload files to the EU region by exporting two additonal environment variables: `export DATADOG_SITE="datadoghq.eu"` and `export DATADOG_API_HOST="api.datadoghq.eu"`.
4. Run the following command:
```bash
datadog-ci sourcemaps upload /path/to/dist \
	--service=my-service \
	--release-version=v35.2395005 \
	--minified-path-prefix=https://hostname.com/static/js
```

**Note**: The CLI has been optimized to upload as many source maps as you need in a very short amount of time (typically a few seconds) to minimize the overhead on your CI's performance.

By running this command against our example `dist` directory (see previous section), Datadog will expect your server or your CDN to deliver the javascript files at `https://hostname.com/static/js/javascript.364758.min.js` and `https://hostname.com/static/js/subdirectory/javascript.464388.min`.js.  When an error occurs in a session of one of your users, the RUM SDK instantaneously collects it. Whenever the given error originated in a file that were downloaded from one of those urls and is also tagged with `version:v35.2395005` and `service:my-service`, the related source map will be used to deobfuscate the stack trace (in this case, the `javascript.464388.js.map` file).

**Note**: Only source maps with the `.js.map` extension work to correctly unminify stack traces in the error tracking UI. Source maps with other extensions, such as `.mjs.map`, are accepted but do not unminify stack traces.

<div class="alert alert-info">A given JavaScript source file can be served from different subdomains depending on the environment (for example, staging or production). You can upload the related source map once and make it work for multiple subdomains by using the absolute prefix path instead of the full url (specify <code>/static/js</code> instead of <code>https://hostname.com/static/js</code>).</div>

## Troubleshoot errors with ease

A minified stack trace is not helpful as you don't have access to the file path and the line number. It's hard to know where something is happening in your code base. In addition, the code snippet is still minified (one long line of transformed code) which makes the troubleshooting process even harder. See below an example of an minified stack trace:

On the contrary, an unminified stack trace gives you all the context you need for a fast and seamless troubleshooting:
