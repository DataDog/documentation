## Overview

The goal of this guide is to explain how to monitor your RUM usage with:

- The RUM estimated usage metric
- The RUM events stored under your account

This guide covers how to track the amount of RUM sessions priced under a specific SKU or application, alert on expected traffic spikes, and alert when you are getting close to a budget threshold on your sessions.

## RUM usage metrics

This metric is free and available for 15 months.

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/guide/monitor-your-rum-usage/estimated-usage-metric-details.png" alt="Estimated usage metrics details side panel" style="width:90%" >}}

By default, you can use the RUM `datadog.estimated_usage.rum.sessions` [metric][1] to track the number of user sessions with the following information:

- Application ID: Identifies the application available on the **Application Overview** page
- Service: Scope inside a RUM application belonging to a given team.
- Source: Which programming language or framework it is built with. 
- SKU: Which paid plan the session is priced under.

### Track count of sessions for an application

To track the count of sessions generated by a RUM application, navigate to the [Dashboard List][2] and select a dashboard to track your RUM usage trend.

1. Click **+ Add Widgets** to open the widgets and apps side panel.
2. Select **Timeseries** under **Graphs**.
3. In the **Graph your data** section, select **Metrics** and `datadog.estimated_usage.rum.sessions` from the dropdown menus.
4. In the `from` clause, select the application ID you are interested in tracking. The RUM application ID is available on its **Application Overview** page. 
5. Set your display preferences and enter a name for your graph.
6. Click **Save**.

### Track count of sessions priced under a SKU

To track the count of sessions priced under a given RUM SKU, navigate to the [Dashboard List][2] and select a dashboard to track your RUM usage trend.

1. Click **+ Add Widgets** to open the widgets and apps side panel.
2. Select **Timeseries** under **Graphs**.
3. In the **Graph your data** section, select **Metrics** and `datadog.estimated_usage.rum.sessions` from the dropdown menus.
4. In the `sum` clause, select the `sku` tag from the dropdown menu. 
5. Set your display preferences and enter a name for your graph.
6. Click **Save**.

## Alert on unexpected spikes

You can use the RUM metric in [anomaly detection monitors][3].

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/guide/monitor-your-rum-usage/anomaly-monitor-notification.png" alt="Example notification message in the Anomaly monitor" style="width:90%" >}}

To create an anomaly detection monitor to be alerted of unexpected session count spikes:

1. Go to your RUM application's **Application Overview** page and copy the application ID.
2. [Create an Anomaly monitor][4].
3. Select the `datadog.estimated_usage.rum.sessions` metric from the dropdown menu.
4. In the `from` clause, enter the `application.id` to be notified if your RUM application has a traffic spike or stops sending events.
5. Set the alert condition to match your use case, for example: an evaluation window or the number of times outside an expected range.
6. Set the notification message with actionable instructions.

   This example notification message contains context links:

   ```
   An unexpected amount of sessions has been captured for application.id {{application.id}}.

   1. [Check the session count in the RUM Explorer for this application](https://app.datadoghq.com/rum/explorer?query=%40type%3Asession%20%40application.id%{{application.id}}&viz=timeseries&from_ts=1649824870521&to_ts=1649828470521&live=true).
   2. [Investigate whether this session count is unexpected in a specific geography or device using the query engine](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/explorer/group/).
   ```

7. Set permissions and notification settings for this monitor.
8. Click **Create**.

## Monitor RUM sessions with a fixed threshold

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/guide/monitor-your-rum-usage/anomaly-monitor-notifications-warning-rate.png" alt="Example notification message with warning rates in the Anomaly monitor" style="width:90%" >}}

To create an anomaly detection monitor to be alerted when the number of sessions grows unexpectedly and is approaching a threshold:

1. Go to the [Datadog RUM Explorer][5] view.
2. Build a search query that represents the volume to monitor. To monitor all user sessions, leave the query blank.
3. Click **Export to monitor**.
4. Define the rate you want to set as `warning` or `error`.
5. Set a concrete notification message.

   This example notification message contains actionable instructions:

   ```
   Shopist.io is sending too many user sessions. Go to the application's codebase and decrease the sample rate. Here is the (documentation)[https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/browser/#browser-and-session-replay-sampling-configuration] for how to do so.

   {{#is_warning}}@slack-Shopist-alerts {{/is_warning}}

   {{#is_alert}}@pagerduty-shopist{{/is_alert}}
   ```

6. Set permissions and notification settings for this monitor.
7. Click **Create**.

You are notified about the amount of sessions captured in any scope (such as the `application.id`, `geography`, `device`, and more) for your application.
