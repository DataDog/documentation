## Overview

UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) tracking is a parameter added in a URL to help track the performance of specific campaigns and identify attribution paths for how visitors arrived on your website. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through the types of UTM parameters Datadog RUM collects and how you can use RUM to monitor their use.

## Data collected

UTM campaigns are connected to View events in RUM. These are collected automatically by the Browser SDK and can be viewed as facets in the RUM explorer. The UTM parameters Datadog collects can be defined as the following:

| Field                | Type   | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `view.url_query.utm_source`     | string | The parameter in the URL tracking the source of traffic. |
| `view.url_query.utm_medium`        | string | The parameter in the URL tracking the channel where the traffic is coming from.    |
| `view.url_query.utm_campaign`  | string | The paramter in the URL identifying the specific marketing campaign tied to that view.              |
| `view.url_query.utm_content`  | string | The paramter in the URL identifying the specific element a user clicked within a marketing campaign.           |
| `view.url_query.utm_term` | string | The parameter in the URL tracking the keyword a user searched to trigger a given campaign.             |

## Use cases

### Identifying how users arrive at my site.
To measure how users arrive at my site, you can use the '@view.url_query.utm_medium' facet. This shows different mediums such as social, organic, search, Google campaigns, or even specific events like a webinar. You can watch session replays from users who come to your website from the different mediums and observe if any noticeable patterns occur between groups.

### Tracking if certain campaigns are higher traffic than others

In the above query, we can count all views to a page, like a landing page, where the campaign is running. This can help you understand if certain pages are getting more visits and you should increase advertising spend toward that specific page.

### Analyze UTM source by country

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/guide/UTM-by-country.png" alt="Screenshot of UTM source by country" style="width:90%;">}}

In this example you can track the different sources of campaigns like advertisements versus organic traffic. We can then add an additional layer, like geography, to understand if viewership patterns change by country.
