## Overview

The frustration signals dashboard provides insight into elements where users experience the most friction in your application. It shows:

- **Rage clicks**: Measures when a user clicks the same button more than three times in a one-second sliding window.
- **Dead clicks**: Measures when a user clicks on a static element, thinking it is interactive.
- **Error clicks**: Measures when a user clicks an element and encounters a JavaScript error.
