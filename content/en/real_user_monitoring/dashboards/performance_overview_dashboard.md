The performance overview dashboard offers a birdâ€™s-eye view of RUM applications. It is separated in three sections:

- **Performance metrics**:
    For all views, four browser metrics are highlighted: Loading Time, First Contentful Paint, DOM Content Loaded, and Load Event. For each one of these metrics, widgets show the median, the 75th percentile, and the 90th percentile.
- **Trends**:
    Visualize the evolution of page views, frontend errors related to backend calls failing, JS errors, and long tasks.
- **Page views breakdown**:
    Analyze the nature of your traffic and the associated loading time for each segment.
