## Overview

The [application testing coverage dashboard][1] uses data collected from [RUM][2] and results from Synthetic [browser tests][3] to provide insights about the overall testing coverage for your application. 

You can use this dashboard to answer the following questions:

- What is and what is not being tested in your application?
- How do you identify the most popular sections of your application to continuously monitor?
- How do you find the most popular user actions in your application to add browser test coverage? 

It shows:

- **Percentage of tested actions**: Scan your application's overall testing coverage.
- **Untested actions**: Explore the most popular untested user actions with the count of real user interactions and the number of actions covered in browser tests.

For more information about the data displayed, see [RUM Browser Data Collected][2].

## Manage browser tests

In order to improve your testing coverage and better manage your browser tests, this dashboard can help you answer the following questions:

- What actions are not being tested in your application?
- What views are the most popular to your users? 
- What views need more browser tests?
- What browser tests are covering user actions? 

By testing the most popular sections of your application through Synthetic browser tests, you are alerted when key user journeys in your application are negatively impacted by a code change. You can run tests [directly in your CI/CD pipelines][4] to ensure no regressions occur before releasing code in production. 

To add a browser test for a top view or untested action, click on a view with a low percentage of tested actions under **Top Views** or an action under **Untested Actions** and select **Create a Synthetics browser test** from the dropdown menu. Clicking **View RUM events** navigates you to the [RUM Explorer][5] with an autofilled search query for actions with a specific view name.

The **Top Views** table lists the most popular web pages that users are interacting with, along with the number of real user interactions and the percentage of actions that are tested in browser tests. 

## Explore custom actions

Use the [template variables][6] to customize the data types and filter out your queried data on [custom actions][7]. 

Datadog recommends using custom actions. By default, custom actions are unique and offer more accurate coverage results compared to generated actions.
