## Overview

The [mobile dashboard][1] provides insights about your mobile RUM application, errors, and crashes. It shows:

- **Screen views**: Monitor your users' screen views by device type, country, app version, and OS version. A list of the most visited screen views displays the view count, the average error count, and average resource count. 
- **Errors and crashes**: Observe the proportion of screens with errors, error count, errors by type, and resources with most errors. A count of crashes and a bar chart of crashes by application version is also available.
