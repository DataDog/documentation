## Overview

Datadog Real User Monitoring (RUM) enables you to visualize and analyze the real-time performance and user journeys of your application's individual users.

## Setup

### Specify application details in the UI

1. In the [Datadog app][1], navigate to **UX Monitoring** > **RUM Applications** > **New Application**.
2. Choose `Flutter` as the application type.
3. Provide an application name to generate a unique Datadog application ID and client token.
4. To disable automatic user data collection for either client IP or geolocation data, uncheck the boxes for those settings. For more information, see [RUM Flutter Data Collected][7].

To ensure the safety of your data, you must use a client token. For more information about setting up a client token, see the [Client Token documentation][2].

### Instrument your application

To initialize the Datadog Flutter SDK for RUM, see [Setup][3].

## Automatically track views

The [Datadog Flutter Plugin][4] can automatically track named routes using the `DatadogNavigationObserver` on your MaterialApp:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  home: HomeScreen(),
  navigatorObservers: [
    DatadogNavigationObserver(DatadogSdk.instance),
  ],
);
```

This works if you are using named routes or if you have supplied a name to the `settings` parameter of your `PageRoute`.

Alternatively, you can use the `DatadogRouteAwareMixin` property in conjunction with the `DatadogNavigationObserverProvider` property to start and stop your RUM views automatically. With `DatadogRouteAwareMixin`, move any logic from `initState` to `didPush`. 

## Automatically track resources

Use the [Datadog Tracking HTTP Client][5] package to enable automatic tracking of resources and HTTP calls from your RUM views. 

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` and add the following to your initialization file:

```dart
final configuration = DdSdkConfiguration(
  // configuration
  firstPartyHosts: ['example.com'],
)..enableHttpTracking()
```

In order to enable Datadog [Distributed Tracing][6], you must set the `DdSdkConfiguration.firstPartyHosts` property in your configuration object to a domain that supports distributed tracing. You can also modify the sampling rate for distributed tracing by setting the `tracingSamplingRate` on your `RumConfiguration`.

- `firstPartyHosts` does not allow wildcards, but matches any subdomains for a given domain. For example, `api.example.com` matches `staging.api.example.com` and `prod.api.example.com`, not `news.example.com`.

- `RumConfiguration.tracingSamplingRate` sets a default sampling rate of 20%. If you want all resources requests to generate a full distributed trace, set this value to `100.0`.
