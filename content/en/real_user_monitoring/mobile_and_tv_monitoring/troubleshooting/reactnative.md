If you experience unexpected behavior with Datadog React Native RUM, use this guide to resolve issues quickly. If you continue to have trouble, contact [Datadog Support][1] for further assistance.

## No data is being sent to Datadog

Follow these instructions in order when the SDK has been installed and the app compiles, but no data is received by Datadog.

### Check the configuration

Sometimes, no data is sent due to a small misstep in the configuration.

Here are some common things to check for:

- Ensure your `clientToken` and `applicationId` are correct.
- Make sure you have not set `sessionSamplingRate` to something other than 100 (100 is the default value), or else your session might be sent.
- If you've set up a `Proxy` in the Datadog configuration, check that it has been correctly configured.
- Check that you are **tracking views** (all events must be attached to a view) and **sending events**.

### Review SDK logs in React Native

- Set `config.verbosity = SdkVerbosity.DEBUG`, which imports `SdkVerbosity` from `@datadog/mobile-react-native`.
- Logs start appearing in the JavaScript console, like the following output:

  ```
  INFO  DATADOG: Datadog SDK was initialized
  INFO  DATADOG: Datadog SDK is tracking interactions
  INFO  DATADOG: Datadog SDK is tracking XHR resources
  INFO  DATADOG: Datadog SDK is tracking errors
  DEBUG  DATADOG: Starting RUM View ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù #Products-oaZlP_FVwGM5vtPoup_rT
  DEBUG  DATADOG: Adding RUM Action ‚ÄúRCTView‚Äù (TAP)
  ```

  **Note**: In this example, the first four logs indicate that the SDK has been correctly configured and the last two lines are events that were sent.

#### Possible cause

If you are on iOS and see some DEBUG logs indicating that logs or RUM events were sent **before** the initialization logs, this may be why the SDK is not sending events.

You cannot send events before initialization, and attempting to do so puts the SDK in a state where it cannot send any data.

#### Solution

With **`DdSdkReactNative.initialize`**:

If you use `DdSdkReactNative.initialize` to start the Datadog SDK, call this function in your top-level `index.js` file so that the SDK is initialized before your other events are sent.

With **`DatadogProvider`**:

Starting from SDK version `1.2.0`, you can initialize the SDK using the `DatadogProvider` component. This component includes a RUM events buffer that makes sure the SDK is initialized before sending any data to Datadog, which prevents this issue from happening.

To use it, see the [Migrate to the Datadog Provider guide][2].

### Review native logs

Reviewing native logs can give you more input on what could be going wrong.

#### On iOS

- Open your project in Xcode by running `xed ios`.
- Build your project for a simulator or a device.
- Native logs start appearing on the bottom right corner:

  {{< img src="real_user_monitoring/react_native/troubleshooting-xcode-logs.png" alt="Reviewing native logs can help you figure out why no data is being sent" >}}

You can filter logs by "DATADOG" and look for any error.

If you are indeed sending events, you should see the following logs:

```
[DATADOG SDK] üê∂ ‚Üí 10:02:47.398 [DEBUG] ‚è≥ (rum) Uploading batch...
[DATADOG SDK] üê∂ ‚Üí 10:02:47.538 [DEBUG]    ‚Üí (rum) accepted, won't be retransmitted: [response code: 202 (accepted), request ID: AAAABBBB-1111-2222-3333-777788883333]
```

The first log indicates that some data is being sent, and the second log indicates that the data has been received.

##### Possible cause

If you see the log below, it means that you have called a RUM method before initializing the SDK.

```
[DATADOG SDK] üê∂ ‚Üí 10:09:13.621 [WARN] The `Global.rum` was called but no `RUMMonitor` is registered. Configure and register the RUM Monitor globally before invoking the feature:
```

##### Solution

With **`DdSdkReactNative.initialize`**:

If you use `DdSdkReactNative.initialize` to start the Datadog SDK, call this function in your top-level `index.js` file so the SDK is initialized before your other events are sent.

With **`DatadogProvider`**:

Starting from SDK version `1.2.0`, you can initialize the SDK using the `DatadogProvider` component. This component includes a RUM events buffer that makes sure the SDK is initialized before sending any data to Datadog, which prevents this issue from happening.

To use it, see the [Migrate to the Datadog Provider guide][2].

#### On Android

- For a better debugging experience, Datadog recommends installing [pidcat][3].
  - pidcat filters the device logs (obtained by `adb logcat`) to only show the one from your application.
  - See [this issue][4] for M1 users who don't have Python 2.
- Modify `node_modules/@datadog/mobile-react-native/android/src/main/kotlin/com/datadog/reactnative/DdSdk.kt` to enable verbose logging from the native SDK:

  ```java
  fun initialize(configuration: ReadableMap, promise: Promise) {
      // ...

      datadog.initialize(appContext, credentials, nativeConfiguration, trackingConsent)
      datadog.setVerbosity(Log.VERBOSE) // Add this line

      // ...
  }
  ```

- Run the app on a phone connected in debug mode to your laptop (should appear when running `adb devices`), or from an emulator.
- Run pidcat `my.app.package.name` or `adb logcat` from your laptop.
- Look for any error mentioning Datadog.

Pidcat output looks like this:

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/react_native/troubleshooting-pidcat-logs.png" alt="This is an example of a pidcat output" >}}

In this example, the last log indicates that the batch of RUM data was sent successfully.

## Undefined symbols: Swift

If you see the following error message:

```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "static Foundation.JSONEncoder.OutputFormatting.withoutEscapingSlashes.getter : Foundation.JSONEncoder.OutputFormatting", referenced from:
      static (extension in Datadog):Foundation.JSONEncoder.default() -> Foundation.JSONEncoder in libDatadogSDK.a(JSONEncoder.o)
...
```

Open Xcode, go to the `Build Settings` of your project (not your app target), and make sure Library Search Paths have the following settings:

```shell
LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS = (
  "\"$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)\"",
  "\"/usr/lib/swift\"",
  "\"$(inherited)\"",
);
```

## Undefined symbols: _RCTModule

If you see an undefined _RCTModule symbol, it may be related to this change in the [react-native v0.63 changelog][5].

You can make the following change to fix it:

```objectivec
// DdSdk.m
// instead of
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
// maybe that:
@import React // or @import React-Core
```

## Infinite loop-like error messages

If you run into an [issue where your React Native project displays a stream of error messages and significantly raises your CPU usage][5], try creating a new React Native project.

## Android build failures with SDK version `2.*`

### `Unable to make field private final java.lang.String java.io.File.path accessible`

If your Android build fails with an error like:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:processReleaseMainManifest'.
> Unable to make field private final java.lang.String java.io.File.path accessible: module java.base does not "opens java.io" to unnamed module @1bbf7f0e
```

You are using Java 17, which is not compatible for your React Native version. Switch to Java 11 to solve the issue.

### `java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError`

If your Android build fails with an error like:

```
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/datadog/android/lint/DatadogIssueRegistry has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0
```

You are using a version of Java that is too old. Switch to Java 17 to solve the issue.

### `Unsupported class file major version 61`

If your Android build fails with an error like:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:lintVitalRelease'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':app:debugRuntimeClasspath'.
   > Failed to transform dd-sdk-android-core-2.0.0.aar (com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android-core:2.0.0) to match attributes {artifactType=android-manifest, org.gradle.category=library, org.gradle.dependency.bundling=external, org.gradle.libraryelements=aar, org.gradle.status=release, org.gradle.usage=java-runtime}.
      > Execution failed for JetifyTransform: /Users/me/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.datadoghq/dd-sdk-android-core/2.0.0/a97f8a1537da1de99a86adf32c307198b477971f/dd-sdk-android-core-2.0.0.aar.
         > Failed to transform '/Users/me/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.datadoghq/dd-sdk-android-core/2.0.0/a97f8a1537da1de99a86adf32c307198b477971f/dd-sdk-android-core-2.0.0.aar' using Jetifier. Reason: IllegalArgumentException, message: Unsupported class file major version 61. (Run with --stacktrace for more details.)
```

You use a version of Android Gradle Plugin below `5.0`. To fix the issue, add in your `android/gradle.properties` file:

```properties
android.jetifier.ignorelist=dd-sdk-android-core
```

### `Duplicate class kotlin.collections.jdk8.*`

If your Android build fails with an error like:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:checkReleaseDuplicateClasses'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.CheckDuplicatesRunnable
   > Duplicate class kotlin.collections.jdk8.CollectionsJDK8Kt found in modules jetified-kotlin-stdlib-1.8.10 (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.8.10) and jetified-kotlin-stdlib-jdk8-1.7.20 (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.7.20)
     Duplicate class kotlin.internal.jdk7.JDK7PlatformImplementations found in modules jetified-kotlin-stdlib-1.8.10 (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.8.10) and jetified-kotlin-stdlib-jdk7-1.7.20 (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:1.7.20)
```

You need to set a Kotlin version for your project to avoid clashes among Kotlin dependencies. In your `android/build.gradle` file, specify the `kotlinVersion`:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        // targetSdkVersion = ...
        kotlinVersion = "1.8.21"
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can add the following rules to your build script in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    constraints {
        implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:1.8.21") {
            because("kotlin-stdlib-jdk7 is now a part of kotlin-stdlib")
        }
        implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.8.21") {
            because("kotlin-stdlib-jdk8 is now a part of kotlin-stdlib")
        }
    }
}
```
