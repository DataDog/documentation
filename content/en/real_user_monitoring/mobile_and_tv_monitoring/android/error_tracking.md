## Overview

Error Tracking processes errors collected from the Android SDK. 

Enable Android Crash Reporting and Error Tracking to get comprehensive crash reports and error trends. With this feature, you can access:

- Aggregated Android crash dashboards and attributes
- Deobfuscated Android crash reports with stack trace mapping
- NDK crash reporting for native code (C/C++)
- ANR (Application Not Responding) reporting
- Trend analysis with Android error tracking

Your crash reports appear in [**Error Tracking**][1].

## Setup

If you have not set up the Android SDK yet, follow the [in-app setup instructions][2] or see the [Android Crash Reporting and Error Tracking setup documentation][3].
