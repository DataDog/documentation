## Overview

Datadog Mobile Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides insights into your mobile application's performance on Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Roku, and more. You can gain valuable visibility into your app's stability, identify and address app crashes, and asses any glitchiness that may impact user experience.

Datadog correlates each user journey with relevant synthetic tests, backend metrics, traces, logs, and network performance, so you can detect and resolve poor user experience, optimize releases, and deliver high-performing applications to users.
