## Overview

The RUM iOS SDK generates events that have associated metrics and attributes. Metrics are quantifiable values that can be used for measurements related to the event. Attributes are non-quantifiable values used to slice metrics data (group by) in analytics. 

Every RUM event has all of the [default attributes](#default-attributes), for example, the device type (`device.type`) and user information such as their name (`usr.name`) and their country (`geo.country`).

There are additional [metrics and attributes that are specific to a given event type](#event-specific-metrics-and-attributes). For example, the metric `view.time_spent` is associated with "view" events and the attribute `resource.method` is associated with "resource" events.

| Event Type | Retention | Description                         |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Session    | 30 days   | A session represents a real user journey on your mobile application. It begins when the user launches the application, and the session remains live as long as the user stays active. During the user journey, all RUM events generated as part of the session share the same `session.id` attribute. **Note:** The session resets after 15 minutes of inactivity. If the application is killed by the OS, you can reset the session while the application is in the background.|
| View       | 30 days   | A view represents a unique screen (or screen segment) on your mobile application. A view starts and stops when the `viewDidAppear(animated:)` and `viewDidDisappear(animated:)` callbacks on the `UIViewController` class are notified. Individual `UIViewControllers` are classified as distinct views. While a user stays on a view, RUM event attributes (Errors, Resources, Actions) get attached to the view with a unique `view.id`.                           |
| Resource   | 15 days   | A resource represents network requests to first-party hosts, APIs, and third-party providers in your mobile application. All requests generated during a user session are attached to the view with a unique `resource.id`.                                                                       |
| Error      | 30 days   | An error represents an exception or crash emitted by the mobile application attached to the view it is generated in.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Action     | 30 days   | An action represents user activity in your mobile application (for example, application launch, tap, swipe, or back). Each action is attached with a unique `action.id` attached to the view it gets generated in.                                                                                                                                              |
| Long Task | 15 days | A long task event is generated for any task in the application that blocks the main thread for more than the specified duration threshold. |


The following diagram illustrates the RUM event hierarchy:

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/data_collected/event-hierarchy.png" alt="RUM Event hierarchy" style="width:50%;border:none" >}}

## Application launch

During initialization, the RUM iOS SDK creates a view called "ApplicationLaunch". This view's start time matches the start of the iOS process, and can be used to track your application launch time.

The ApplicationLaunch view includes any logs, actions, and resources created before your first call to `startView`. Use the duration of this view to determine time to first view. This view has an action, `application_start`, with a duration equal to the amount of time from process start until the call to `applicationDidBecomeActive`.

In cases where iOS decides to [prewarm your application][4], the ApplicationLaunch view instead starts when the RUM iOS SDK is initialized, and the `application_start` event does not have a duration.

## Default attributes

RUM collects common attributes for all events and attributes specific to each event by default listed below. You can also choose to enrich your user session data with [additional events][1] to default events specific to your application monitoring and business analytics needs.
