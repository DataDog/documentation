## Overview

Datadog Real User Monitoring (RUM) enables you to visualize and analyze the real-time performance and user journeys of your application's individual users.

The minimum supported version for the RUM React Native SDK is React Native v0.63.4+. Compatibility with older versions is not guaranteed out-of-the-box.

The RUM React Native SDK supports [Expo][12]. For more information, see the [Expo documentation][13].

## Setup

To install with NPM, run:

```sh
npm install @datadog/mobile-react-native
```

To install with Yarn, run:

```sh
yarn add @datadog/mobile-react-native
```

### iOS

Install the added pod:

```sh
(cd ios && pod install)
```

### Android

If you use a React Native version strictly over 0.67, make sure to use Java version 17. If you use React Native version equal or below ot 0.67, make sure to use Java version 11.

In your `android/build.gradle` file, specify the `kotlinVersion` to avoid clashes among kotlin dependencies:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        // targetSdkVersion = ...
        kotlinVersion = "1.8.21"
    }
}
```

The Datadog React Native SDK requires you to have `compileSdkVersion = 31` or higher in the Android application setup, which implies that you should use Build Tools version 31 or higher, Android Gradle Plugin version 7, and Gradle version 7 or higher. To modify the versions, change the values in the `buildscript.ext` block of your application's top-level `build.gradle` file. Datadog recommends using a React Native version that's actively supported.

### Specify application details in the UI

1. In Datadog, navigate to [**Digital Experience** > **Add an Application**][1].
2. Choose `react-native` as the application type.
3. Provide an application name to generate a unique Datadog application ID and client token.
4. To disable automatic user data collection for either client IP or geolocation data, uncheck the boxes for those settings.

   {{< img src="real_user_monitoring/react_native/reactnative_setup.png" alt="Create a RUM application for React Native in Datadog" style="width:90%;">}}

To ensure the safety of your data, you must use a client token. If you used only [Datadog API keys][3] to configure the `@datadog/mobile-react-native` library, they would be exposed client-side in the React Native application's code.

For more information about setting up a client token, see the [Client Token documentation][4].

### Initialize the library with application context

### Override the reported version

By default, the Datadog React Native SDK reports the `version` as the commercial version of your app (for example, "1.2.44").

If you use an Over The Air (OTA) updates provider like Microsoft's CodePush, you can override this version to indicate which version of your JavaScript code is running.

Datadog recommends using a `versionSuffix` to the `DatadogProviderConfiguration` object:

```js
const config = new DatadogProviderConfiguration(
    '<CLIENT_TOKEN>',
    '<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>',
    '<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>',
    true,
    true,
    true
);

config.versionSuffix = 'codepush.3';
```

If the commercial version of your app is "1.2.44", it is reported as "1.2.44-codepush.3" in Datadog. A dash (`-`) is automatically added between the version and the suffix.

You can also completely override the version by specifying the `version` field. However, make sure you set it correctly, as it has to match the one specified during the upload of your source maps and other mapping files.

For more information about limitations on the version field, see the [Tags documentation][15].

### User interactions tracking

If user interactions tracking is enabled as in the code example above, the Datadog React Native SDK traverses up the hierarchy of components starting from the component that received a tap, looking for `dd-action-name` property. Once found, it is used as a name for the action reported.

Alternatively, you can use the `accessibilityLabel` element property to give the tap action a name; otherwise, the element type is reported. You can check the sample app for usage examples.

### Track view navigation

Because React Native offers a wide range of libraries to create screen navigation, only manual view tracking is supported by default. To see RUM sessions populate in Datadog, you need to implement view tracking.

You can manually start and stop a view using the following `startView()` and `stopView` methods.

```js
import {
    DdRum
} from '@datadog/mobile-react-native';

// Start a view with a unique view identifier, a custom view name, and an object to attach additional attributes to the view
DdRum.startView(
    '<view-key>', // <view-key> has to be unique, for example it can be ViewName-unique-id
    'View Name',
    { 'custom.foo': 'something' },
    Date.now()
);
// Stops a previously started view with the same unique view identifier, and an object to attach additional attributes to the view
DdRum.stopView('<view-key>', { 'custom.bar': 42 }, Date.now());
```

Use one of Datadog's integrations to automatically track views for the following libraries:

-   If you use the [`react-native-navigation`][5] library, then add the `@datadog/mobile-react-native-navigation` package and follow the [setup instructions][6].
-   If you use the [`react-navigation`][7] library, then add the `@datadog/mobile-react-navigation` package and follow the [setup instructions][8].

If you experience any issues setting up View tracking with `@datadog/mobile-react-navigation` you can see our [example application][16] as a reference.

## Track custom attributes

You can attach user information to all RUM events to get more detailed information from your RUM sessions.

### User information

For user-specific information, use the following code wherever you want in your app (after the SDK has been initialized). The `id`, `name`, and `email` attributes are built into Datadog, and you can add other attributes that makes sense for your app.

```js
DdSdkReactNative.setUser({
    id: '1337',
    name: 'John Smith',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    type: 'premium'
});
```

If you want to clear the user information (for example, when the user signs out), you can do so by passing an empty object, as follows:

```js
DdSdkReactNative.setUser({});
```

### Global attributes

You can also keep global attributes to track information about a specific session, such as A/B testing configuration, ad campaign origin, or cart status.

```js
DdSdkReactNative.setAttributes({
    profile_mode: 'wall',
    chat_enabled: true,
    campaign_origin: 'example_ad_network'
});
```

## Track background events

<div class="alert alert-info"><p>Tracking background events may lead to additional sessions, which can impact billing. For questions, <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">contact Datadog support.</a></p>
</div>

You can track events such as crashes and network requests when your application is in the background (for example, when no active view is available).

Add the following snippet during initialization in your Datadog configuration:

```javascript
configuration.trackBackgroundEvents = true;
```

## Data Storage

### Android

Before data is uploaded to Datadog, it is stored in cleartext in your application's cache directory. This cache folder is protected by [Android's Application Sandbox][10], meaning that on most devices this data can't be read by other applications. However, if the mobile device is rooted, or someone tampers with the Linux kernel, the stored data might become readable.

### iOS

Before data is uploaded to Datadog, it is stored in cleartext in the cache directory (`Library/Caches`) of your [application sandbox][11], which can't be read by any other app installed on the device.

## Development mode

While in development mode, your application can submit extra events related to the React Native tooling, such as code transformation errors and requests to a local development server.

To prevent these events from showing in the dashboard, you can disable errors and resources tracking in dev mode using the `__DEV__` flag:

```js
const config = new DatadogProviderConfiguration(
	CLIENT_TOKEN,
	ENVIRONMENT,
	APPLICATION_ID,
	true,
	!__DEV__  /* trackResources will be false in DEV mode, true otherwise */,
	!__DEV__  /* trackErrors will be false in DEV mode, true otherwise */,
	trackingConsent
)
```

## New architecture support

The [React Native new architecture][17] is supported by the RUM React Native SDK in version `>=1.8.0`.

The minimum supported React Native version for the new architecture is `0.71`.

## Troubleshooting

### Usage with `use_frameworks!`

If you have `use_frameworks!` enabled in your `Podfile`, running `pod install` after adding the SDK is likely to trigger an error like this one:

```shell
The 'Pods-MyApp' target has transitive dependencies that include statically linked binaries: (DatadogSDKBridge, DatadogSDKCrashReporting)
```

To prevent that error, edit your `Podfile` to install the React Native SDK pod as a static library:

```ruby
static_libraries = ['DatadogSDKReactNative']

# Turn pods with static dependencies into static libraries by overriding the static_framework? function to return true
pre_install do |installer|
  installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
    if static_libraries.include?(pod.name)
      def pod.static_framework?;
        true
      end
      def pod.build_type;
        Pod::BuildType.static_library
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Note**: This solution comes from this [StackOverflow][14] post.
