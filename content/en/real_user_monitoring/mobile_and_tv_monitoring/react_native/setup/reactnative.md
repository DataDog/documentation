## Overview

This page describes how to instrument your applications for both [Real User Monitoring (RUM)][1] or [Error Tracking][2] with the React Native SDK. You can follow the steps below to instrument your applications for RUM (includes Error Tracking), or Error Tracking if you have purchased it as a standalone product.

The minimum supported version for the React Native SDK is React Native v0.63.4+. Compatibility with older versions is not guaranteed out-of-the-box.

The React Native SDK supports the following services:

- [CodePush][3]. For more information, see the [CodePush documentation][4].
- [Expo][5]. For more information, see the [Expo documentation][6].

## Setup

To install with NPM, run:

```sh
npm install @datadog/mobile-react-native
```

To install with Yarn, run:

```sh
yarn add @datadog/mobile-react-native
```

### iOS

Install the added pod:

```sh
(cd ios && pod install)
```

### Android

If you use a React Native version strictly over 0.67, make sure to use Java version 17. If you use React Native version equal or below ot 0.67, make sure to use Java version 11.

In your `android/build.gradle` file, specify the `kotlinVersion` to avoid clashes among kotlin dependencies:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        // targetSdkVersion = ...
        kotlinVersion = "1.8.21"
    }
}
```

The Datadog React Native SDK requires you to have `compileSdkVersion = 31` or higher in the Android application setup, which implies that you should use Build Tools version 31 or higher, Android Gradle Plugin version 7, and Gradle version 7 or higher. To modify the versions, change the values in the `buildscript.ext` block of your application's top-level `build.gradle` file. Datadog recommends using a React Native version that's actively supported.

### Specify application details in the UI

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "RUM" %}}

1. In Datadog, navigate to [**Digital Experience** > **Add an Application**][1].
2. Choose `react-native` as the application type.
3. Provide an application name to generate a unique Datadog application ID and client token.
4. To disable automatic user data collection for client IP or geolocation data, uncheck the boxes for those settings.

To ensure the safety of your data, you must use a client token. If you used only [Datadog API keys][7] to configure the `@datadog/mobile-react-native` library, they would be exposed client-side in the React Native application's code.

For more information about setting up a client token, see the [Client Token documentation][8].

### Initialize the library with application context

#### Sample session rates

<div class="alert alert-warning">Configuring the session sample rate does not apply to Error Tracking.</div>

To control the data your application sends to Datadog RUM, you can specify a sampling rate for RUM sessions while [initializing the RUM React Native SDK][9] as a percentage between 0 and 100. You can specify the rate with the `config.sessionSamplingRate` parameter.

#### Set tracking consent (GDPR compliance)

To be compliant with the GDPR regulation, the React Native SDK requires the tracking consent value at initialization.

The `trackingConsent` setting can be one of the following values:

1. `.PENDING`: The React Native SDK starts collecting and batching the data but does not send it to Datadog. The RUM iOReact NativeS SDK waits for the new tracking consent value to decide what to do with the batched data.
2. `.GRANTED`: The React Native SDK starts collecting the data and sends it to Datadog.
3. `.NOTGRANTED`: The RUM iReact NativeOS SDK does not collect any data. No logs, traces, or RUM events are sent to Datadog.

To change the tracking consent value after the React Native SDK is initialized, use the `Datadog.set(trackingConsent:)` API call. The React Native SDK changes its behavior according to the new value.

For example, if the current tracking consent is `.PENDING`:

- If you change the value to `.GRANTED`, the React Native SDK sends all current and future data to Datadog;
- If you change the value to `.NOTGRANTED`, the React Native SDK wipes all current data and does not collect future data.

### Override the reported version

By default, the Datadog React Native SDK reports the `version` as the commercial version of your app (for example, "1.2.44").

If you use an Over The Air (OTA) updates provider like Microsoft's CodePush, you can override this version to indicate which version of your JavaScript code is running.

Datadog recommends using a `versionSuffix` to the `DatadogProviderConfiguration` object:

```js
const config = new DatadogProviderConfiguration(
    '<CLIENT_TOKEN>',
    '<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>',
    '<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>',
    true,
    true,
    true
);

config.versionSuffix = 'codepush.3';
```

If the commercial version of your app is "1.2.44", it is reported as "1.2.44-codepush.3" in Datadog. A dash (`-`) is automatically added between the version and the suffix.

You can also completely override the version by specifying the `version` field. However, make sure you set it correctly, as it has to match the one specified during the upload of your source maps and other mapping files.

For more information about limitations on the version field, see the [Tags documentation][10].

### User interactions tracking

If user interactions tracking is enabled as in the code example above, the Datadog React Native SDK traverses up the hierarchy of components starting from the component that received a tap, looking for `dd-action-name` property. Once found, it is used as a name for the action reported.

Alternatively, you can use the `accessibilityLabel` element property to give the tap action a name; otherwise, the element type is reported. You can check the sample app for usage examples.

## Sending data when device is offline

The React Native SDK ensures availability of data when your user device is offline. In cases of low-network areas, or when the device battery is too low, all events are first stored on the local device in batches. They are sent as soon as the network is available, and the battery is high enough to ensure the React Native SDK does not impact the end user's experience. If the network is not available with your application running in the foreground, or if an upload of data fails, the batch is kept until it can be sent successfully.

This means that even if users open your application while offline, no data is lost.

**Note**: The data on the disk is automatically deleted if it gets too old to ensure the React Native SDK does not use too much disk space.

## Track background events

<div class="alert alert-info"><p>Tracking background events may lead to additional sessions, which can impact billing. For questions, <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">contact Datadog support.</a></p>
</div>

You can track events such as crashes and network requests when your application is in the background (for example, when no active view is available).

Add the following snippet during initialization in your Datadog configuration:

```javascript
configuration.trackBackgroundEvents = true;
```

## Data storage

### Android

Before data is uploaded to Datadog, it is stored in cleartext in your application's cache directory. This cache folder is protected by [Android's Application Sandbox][11], meaning that on most devices this data can't be read by other applications. However, if the mobile device is rooted, or someone tampers with the Linux kernel, the stored data might become readable.

### iOS

Before data is uploaded to Datadog, it is stored in cleartext in the cache directory (`Library/Caches`) of your [application sandbox][12], which can't be read by any other app installed on the device.

## Development mode

While in development mode, your application can submit extra events related to the React Native tooling, such as code transformation errors and requests to a local development server.

To prevent these events from showing in the dashboard, you can disable errors and resources tracking in dev mode using the `__DEV__` flag:

```js
const config = new DatadogProviderConfiguration(
	CLIENT_TOKEN,
	ENVIRONMENT,
	APPLICATION_ID,
	true,
	!__DEV__  /* trackResources will be false in DEV mode, true otherwise */,
	!__DEV__  /* trackErrors will be false in DEV mode, true otherwise */,
	trackingConsent
)
```

## New architecture support

The [React Native new architecture][11] is supported by the React Native SDK in version `>=1.8.0`.

The minimum supported React Native version for the new architecture is `0.71`.

## Troubleshooting

### Usage with `use_frameworks!`

If you have `use_frameworks!` enabled in your `Podfile`, running `pod install` after adding the SDK is likely to trigger an error like this one:

```shell
The 'Pods-MyApp' target has transitive dependencies that include statically linked binaries: (DatadogSDKBridge, DatadogSDKCrashReporting)
```

To prevent that error, edit your `Podfile` to install the React Native SDK pod as a static library:

```ruby
static_libraries = ['DatadogSDKReactNative']

# Turn pods with static dependencies into static libraries by overriding the static_framework? function to return true
pre_install do |installer|
  installer.pod_targets.each do |pod|
    if static_libraries.include?(pod.name)
      def pod.static_framework?;
        true
      end
      def pod.build_type;
        Pod::BuildType.static_library
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Note**: This solution comes from this [StackOverflow][13] post.
