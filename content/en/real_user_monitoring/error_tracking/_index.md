## What is Error Tracking?

Across the different products of its platform, namely [Real User Monitoring](/real_user_monitoring), [APM](/tracing) and [Log Management](/logs), Datadog collects a lot of errors. The monitoring of those errors is critical for the health of a system but there can be so many individual error events that itâ€™s hard to identify which ones matter the most and should be fixed first. 

__Error Tracking__ makes it easy by:

- __Grouping similar errors into issues__ to reduce the noise and help identify the most important ones.
- __Following issues over time__ to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing and more importantly how often they are occurring.
- __Getting all the context needed in one place__ to facilitate the troubleshooting.

## Getting started

__Error Tracking__ processes for now __errors collected from the browser by the RUM SDK__ (errors with [source origin](/real_user_monitoring/data_collected/error#error-origins)). We plan to soon process errors from your mobile and back-end applications using errors already collected through the RUM and APM SDKs.

For __Error Tracking__ to properly work:

- Set the __version__, the __environment__ and the __service__ when [initializing the RUM Browser SDK](/real_user_monitoring/installation/?tab=us#initialization-parameters).
- Download the `v1.11.5` version and onwards of the [RUM SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datadog/browser-rum).

### Upload mapping files

The source code of some applications is __obfuscated or minified when deployed to production for performance optimization and security concerns__. The consequence is that stack traces of errors fired from those applications are also obfuscated making the __troubleshooting process harder__: they cannot be used to understand which file and which line of code are responsible for a given error.

__Securely upload your source maps to access deobfuscated stack traces within Datadog.__

#### Javascript source maps

Source maps are mapping files generated when minifying Javascript source code. The __Datadog CLI__ can be used to upload those mapping files from your build directory: it scans the build directory and its subdirectories to automatically upload the source maps along with their related minified files. Upload your source maps directly from your CI pipeline:

1. Add `@datadog/datadog-ci` to your `package.json` file (you must use the `v0.5.2` version and onwards of the CLI)
2. Export your Datadog API key as an environment variable named `DATADOG_API_KEY`
3. Run the following command:
   ```console
   datadog-ci sourcemaps upload /path/to/build/directory \
              --service=my-service \
              --release-version=v35.2395005 \
              --minified-path-prefix=https://hostname.com/static/js
   ```
  
Get more information about CLI parameters in the [official Github repository](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/tree/master/src/commands/sourcemaps)

<div class="alert alert-warning">You must configure your Javascript bundler to create <strong>source maps that directly include the related source code</strong>. You should make sure the <code>sourceContent</code> attribute in your source maps is not empty before uploading them.</div>
