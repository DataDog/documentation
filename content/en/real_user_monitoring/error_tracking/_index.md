## What is error tracking?

Across the different products of its platform, namely [Real User Monitoring][/real_user_monitoring], [APM][/tracing] and [Log Management][/logs], Datadog collects a lot of errors. The monitoring of those errors is critical for the health of a system but there can be so many individual error events that itâ€™s hard to identify which ones matter the most and should be fixed first. The goal of Error Tracking is to make this easy by:
* __Grouping similar errors into issues__ to reduce the noise and help identify the most important ones.
* __Following issues over time__ to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing and more importantly how often they are occurring.
* __Getting all the context needed in one place__ to facilitate the troubleshooting.

## Getting Started

Error Tracking processes for now __errors collected from the browser by the RUM SDK__ (errors with [source origin][/real_user_monitoring/data_collected/error#error-origins]). We plan to soon process errors from your mobile and back-end applications using errors already collected through the RUM and APM SDKs.

For Error Tracking to properly work, you must set the __version__, the __environment__ and the __service__ when initializing your different SDKs or when configuring your Datadog agent (for APM only, once supported). Refer to the dedicated documentation for more information:
* [Initialize the RUM SDK][/real_user_monitoring/installation/?tab=us#initialization-parameters]

__Important note__: you must download the `v1.11.5` version and onwards of the RUM SDK.
