## What is error tracking?

Across the different products of its platform, namely [Real User Monitoring][/real_user_monitoring], [APM][/tracing] and [Log Management][/logs], Datadog collects a lot of errors. The monitoring of those errors is critical for the health of a system but there can be so many individual error events that itâ€™s hard to identify which ones matter the most and should be fixed first. The goal of Error Tracking is to make this easy by:
* __Grouping similar errors into issues__ to reduce the noise and help identify the most important ones.
* __Following issues over time__ to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing and more importantly how often they are occurring.
* __Getting all the context needed in one place__ to facilitate the troubleshooting.
