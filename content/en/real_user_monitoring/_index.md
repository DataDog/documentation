## What is Real User Monitoring?

Datadog's *Real User Monitoring (RUM)* gives you end-to-end visibility into the real-time activity and experience of individual users. RUM solves four types of use cases for monitoring web and mobile applications:

* **Performance**: Track the performance of web pages, mobile application screens, user actions, network requests, and your frontend code.
* **Error Management**: Monitor the ongoing bugs and issues and track them over time and versions.
* **Analytics / Usage**: Understand who is using your application (country, device, OS), monitor individual users journeys, and analyze how users interact with your application (most common page visited, clicks, interactions, and feature usage).
* **Support**: Retrieve all of the information related to one user session to troubleshoot an issue (session duration, pages visited, interactions, resources loaded, and errors).

A user session is a user journey on your web or mobile application lasting up to four hours. A session usually includes pageviews and associated telemetry. If a user does not interact with an application for 15 minutes, the session is considered complete. A new session starts when the user interacts with the application again.

## What is Session Replay?

Datadog's *Session Replay* allows you to capture and visually replay the web browsing experience of your users.

Combined with RUM performance data, Session Replay is beneficial for error identification, reproduction, and resolution, and provides insights into your web application's usage patterns and design pitfalls.

## Get started
