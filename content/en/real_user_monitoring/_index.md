## What is Real User Monitoring?


Datadog's Real User Monitoring (RUM) gives you end-to-end visibility into the real-time activity and experience of individual users. It is designed to solve 4 types of use cases for web and mobile applications:

* **Performance**: Track the performance of web pages, mobile application screens, user actions, network requests, and your front-end code
* **Error Management**: Monitor the ongoing bugs and issues and track them over time and versions
* **Analytics / Usage**: Understand who is using your application (country, device, OS…), monitor individual users journeys, and analyze how users interact with your application (most common page visited, clicks, interactions, feature usage…)
* **Support**: Retrieve all of the information related to one user session to troubleshoot an issue (session duration, pages visited, interactions, resources loaded, errors…)
