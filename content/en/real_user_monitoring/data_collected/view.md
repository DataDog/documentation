A page view represents a user visiting a page from your website. During that page view, [errors][1], [resources][2], [long tasks][3], and [user actions][4] get attached to that page view with a unique `view.id` attribute. Note that a page view gets updated as new events are collected.

For page views, loading performance metrics are collected from both the [Paint Timing API][5] and the [Navigation Timing API][6].

For Single Page Applications (SPAs), performance metrics will only be available for the first accessed page. Modern web frameworks like ReactJS, AngularJS, or VueJS update a websiteâ€™s content without reloading the page, preventing Datadog from collecting traditional performance metrics. RUM is able to track page changes using the [History API][7].
