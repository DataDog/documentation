## Overview

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/rum_without_limits/filters-rum-measure-view.png" alt="Visualization of Android app crash-free sessions percentage over four weeks." style="width:90%" >}}

Datadog provides the below out-of-the-box metrics for a comprehensive overview of your application's health over time. To ensure accuracy, these metrics are computed prior to retaining or discarding any sessions. This means that even though you keep 0.01% of your sessions, these metrics are computed based on 100% of the ingested sessions. These metrics are powering the [performance summary][1] to give you an accurate overview of the performance of your apps.

**Notes**:
- The **Default** cardinality set in the table below includes the following dimensions: environment, app name, app ID, app version, service, OS name, OS version, browser name, and country.
- All queries for the below metrics include `@session.type:user`.
- If you need performance metrics beyond the ones listed below, you can create [custom metrics][2] from your RUM events. These metrics are also computed based on 100% of the traffic ingested.
