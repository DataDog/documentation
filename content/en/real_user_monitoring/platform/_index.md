## Overview

Once you've started collecting data for your RUM applications, you can leverage Datadog platform capabilities to visualize, monitor, and analyze data across RUM and the rest of your connected stack. 

## Create dashboards
Use [dashboards][1] to track, analyze, and display key performance and usage metrics.

## Configure monitors
Configure [monitors][2] to notify your teams, and manage alerts at a glance on the Alerting platform.

## Generate Custom Metrics
Generate [custom metrics][3] to track application KPIs over an extended period of time of up to 15 months.
