The SLO widget visualizes the status, budget, and remaining error budget of the existing SLOs. It displays all underlying groups of the SLO and lets you sort the groups by any of the time windows in the widget. 

Use this widget to build out meaningful dashboards with the most critical SLO information. For more information, <a href="/dashboards/widgets/slo/">see the documentation</a>.
