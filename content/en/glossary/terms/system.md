In <a href="/internal_developer_portal/software_catalog/entity_model/entity_types/?tab=system">Software Catalog</a>, a system (`kind:system`) is a group of entities that cooperate to perform a broader function. For example, you can group multiple instrumented APM services into a system because they are operated by the same team. You can also use system to represent a full microservice-based architecture, and include components like APIs, datastores, queues, and other common building blocks.

**Note:** **System** in Datadog has the same meaning as in <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/system-model/">Backstage's System Model</a>.
