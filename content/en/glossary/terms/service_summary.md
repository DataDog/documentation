A service is a set of processes that do the same job, for example, a web framework or database. Datadog provides out-of-the-box graphs to display service information, as seen on the <a href="/tracing/services/service_page/">Service page</a>. 

Use the service summary widget to display the graphs of a chosen service in your dashboard. For more information, <a href="/dashboards/widgets/service_summary/">see the documentation</a>.
