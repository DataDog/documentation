In Datadog Synthetic Monitoring and CI Visibility, a test suite is generally a group of tests exercising the same unit of code depending on your language and testing framework. You can access an <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci/blob/master/src/commands/junit/__tests__/upload.test.ts">example of a test suite</a> which corresponds to a test file in the `datadog-ci` repository. For more information, <a href="/tests/#supported-features">see the documentation</a>.
