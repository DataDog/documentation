Indexed logs are [logs][1] that have been collected, processed, and retained for analysis, alerting, and troubleshooting.

Indexed spans represent [spans][2] indexed by a [retention filter][3] stored in Datadog for 15 days that can be used to search, query, and monitor in [Search Spans][4] by the [tags][5] included on the span.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Creating <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces/retention-filters">tag-based retention filters</a> after ingestion allows you to control and visualize exactly how many spans are being indexed per service.

In this example, the requests (`merchant.store_name` and `merchant.tier`) have been added as tags to the span.

To get started with tagging spans in your application, see the [Adding span tags][6] guide.

After a tag has been added to a span, search and query on the tag in Analytics by clicking on the tag to add it as a [facet][7]. Once this is done, the value of this tag is stored for all new traces and can be used in the search bar, facet panel, and trace graph query.
