Checks are small Python programs run periodically by the Agent. A Check performs an action and then gathers the result, which the Agent then stores and reports to the Datadog platform. These programs are freeform and are generally used to collect metrics from custom environments or applications.  Note that the word "check" - when not capitalized - refers to the generic act of taking a measurement.
