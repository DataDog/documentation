A distribution is a metric type that aggregates values (such as `count`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `avg`, `p50`, `p75`, `p90`, `p95`, and `p99`) sent from multiple hosts during a flush interval.

The distribution visualization shows data aggregated across one or several tags, such as hosts. Unlike the heatmap, a distribution graphâ€™s x-axis is quantity rather than time. For more information, <a href="/metrics/distributions/">see the documentation</a>.
