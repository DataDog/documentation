Anomaly detection is an algorithmic feature that identifies when a metric behaves differently than it has in the past. It takes into account trends, seasonal day-of-week, and time-of-day patterns. It is suited for metrics with strong trends and recurring patterns that are hard to monitor with threshold-based alerting.
