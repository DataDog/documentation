A dashboard is Datadogâ€™s tool for visually tracking, analyzing, and displaying key performance metrics, enabling you to monitor the health of your infrastructure.

Dashboards are on a grid-based layout, which can include a variety of objects such as images, graphs, and logs. They have a maximum width of 12 grid squares and work well for debugging. For more information, <a href="/dashboards/">see the documentation</a>.
