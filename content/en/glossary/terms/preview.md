**PREVIEW** indicates an early access version of a major product or feature that you can opt into before its official release. Previews allow you to explore new functionalities, provide valuable feedback, and help shape the final product. While using a feature in Preview, you might encounter limited features or minor issues, as the product is still under active development.

To see a complete list of active previews, get more information, and sign up to participate, go to [Datadog Product Preview Program][1].
