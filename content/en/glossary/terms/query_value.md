Query values display the current value of a given metric, APM, or log query. They come with conditional formatting (such as a green/yellow/red background) to convey whether the value is in the expected range. This can be supplemented with optional backgrounds of timeseries data. 

The values displayed by a query value do not require an instantaneous measurement. The widget can display the latest value reported, or an aggregate computed from all query values across the time window. For more information, <a href="/dashboards/widgets/query_value/">see the documentation</a>.
