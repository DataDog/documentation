An APM Metrics or Trace Analytics monitor works like a [metric monitor][1], which is useful for a continuous stream of data, but with controls tailored specifically to APM. Use these monitors to receive alerts at the service level on hits, errors, and a variety of latency measures.
For more information, [see the documentation][2].
