Tailing is derived from the `tail` command in Unix and Linux operating systems. When you tail a log file, you print out the last few lines of the file instead of printing the entire log file. Usually, you tail a file when you're trying to find the most recent events in a log file. You can set the Datadog Agent up to tail a log file. For more information see [Custom log collection][1]
