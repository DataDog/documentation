title: Intelligent Retention Filter
---
A Datadog default retention filter that is always active, keeping a representative proportion of traces, true high latency, and diverse error traces to help you monitor the health of your applications. It is not random, and so traces only retained by Intelligent Retention are not included in trace metrics.
