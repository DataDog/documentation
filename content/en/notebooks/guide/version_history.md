## Overview

Driven by [Audit Trail][1], Version History automatically saves versions of your Dashboards and Notebooks. You have the flexibility to view changes, preview a version, restore a version or clone a version with this feature. 

## Prerequisites
- In order to view versions, edits must be made within the 30 day default retention period.
- If edits were made over 30 days ago you can enable Audit Trail to see the full 90 days of history. 

## View versions
From a notebook click on the cog icon at the top of the page and select **Version History** to open the Version History side panel.

From the side panel, you can view:
- Who made what change when
- Change descriptions of a version to its predecessor

## Preview a version
From the Version History side panel, click on a version to preview what your dashboard or notebook would look like if you choose to restore to that version.

## Restore a version
- From the Version History side panel, after you choose the version to restore, click the three dot ellipsis menu and select **Restore this version**.
- When the Version History side panel opens up, a button appears at the top of the page to **Restore this version**.

## Clone a version
If you do not want to change your current notebook, you can clone a previous version. This will copy and create a new notebook. From the Version History side panel, after you choose the version to restore, click the three dot ellipsis menu and select **Clone**.
