Guides in the Datadog documentation are pages that provide background knowledge, provide steps for advanced use cases, or walk you through workflows that are specific to particular scenarios. Most, but not all sections of the docs, have Guides, which you can access by clicking the links below or through the left-hand navigation for each section.
