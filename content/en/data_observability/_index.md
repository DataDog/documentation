## Overview
Data Observability helps data teams detect, resolve, and prevent issues that affect data quality, performance, and cost. It enables teams to monitor anomalies, troubleshoot faster, and maintain trust in the data powering downstream systems.

## Key capabilities

With Data Observability, you can:
- Catch data quality issues with ML-powered monitoring for volume, freshness, and column distributions
- Trace data dependencies and assess blast radius with column-level lineage from source to downstream systems
- Monitor Databricks and Spark jobs across K8s, Amazon EMR, and Google Dataproc to identify failures and optimize costs
