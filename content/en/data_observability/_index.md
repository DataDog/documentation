## Overview
Data Observability (DO) helps data teams deliver reliable data for analytics, production systems, and AI applications. By unifying quality and jobs monitoring from production to consumption, teams can detect and remediate issues faster while optimizing cost and performance.

## Key capabilities

- **Detect failures early**: Catch bad data and stalled pipelines in warehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, and BigQuery via ML-powered monitors before dashboards, stakeholders, or AI models are impacted.
- **Accelerate remediation**: Triage faster using end-to-end lineage to pinpoint root causes, assess incident blast radius, and route to the right owner.
- **Optimize cost & performance**: Control spend and improve efficiency with job-level visibility and proactive query recommendations to fix inefficiencies in Databricks and Spark jobs across K8s, Amazon EMR, and Google Dataproc.
- **Unify end-to-end observability**: Correlate data quality, pipeline execution, and infrastructure signals in one place, spanning the entire data lifecycle.
