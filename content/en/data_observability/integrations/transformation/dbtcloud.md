## Overview

Datadog can access your dbt Cloud metadata to extract information about job runs, including run durations, models generated by dbt, and lineage relationships between models. Datadog matches tables in your warehouse with dbt models to determine the causality and consequences of table failure.

This page explains how to connect your dbt Cloud data to Datadog.

## Generate an API token in dbt Cloud

Create a service token in dbt Cloud so Datadog can access your account's metadata.

1. In dbt Cloud, go to **User Profile > API Tokens > Service Tokens**.
2. Click on **+ Create Service Token**.
3. Provide a name for the token.
4. Set the token permissions:
   - For dbt Cloud Enterprise plan, ensure that the token has **Developer** permissions.
   - For dbt Cloud Team plan, ensure that the token has **Account Admin** permissions.
5. Click Save and copy the generated API Token.

## Connect your dbt Cloud account to Datadog

Use the API token to configure the integration in Datadog.

1. Navigate to Datadog's [dbt Cloud integration tile][1].
2. If you have already created a dbt Cloud integration account, make sure you have updated it with the API Token with permissions described above.
3. If not, create a new account. Fill in the **Account Name**, **Account Id**, **Account Url**, and **API Token** sections.
4. Click the **Save** button to save your settings.

## What's next

After your next dbt job run, you should start seeing job run and lineage data in [Datadog Data Observability][2], as shown below.
