## Your team’s entities

{{< img src="tracing/software_catalog/services_entities_table.png" alt="Services & entities for the user" style="width:100%;" >}}  

The top section of the Team Overview displays a scoped-down view of your team’s key entities. This view automatically aggregates data from your linked Datadog products and integrations. View recently viewed entities, entities owned by your team, or explicitly favorited entities.

You can view the following fields for each service or entity:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Type** | The entity type (for example, Service, Monitor, Incident). |
| **Name** | The entity’s display name or identifier. |
| **Scorecards** | Summary of the service’s health based on reliability, performance, and error budgets. |
| **Last Deploy** | The most recent deployment detected by APM or CI integrations. |
| **Monitors** | Count and state of monitors affecting the service. |
| **Issues** | Active issues related to the service, aggregated from linked tracking tools. |
| **Incidents** | Open incidents associated with the team’s services. |
| **Dashboards** | Key dashboards linked to the service. |
| **On-Call** | The current on-call responder for the team or service. |
