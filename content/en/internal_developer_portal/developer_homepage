## Overview

The **Developer Homepage** provides a centralized view of your team’s entities and your daily tasks.  

With this view, you can:
- Monitor your team’s key entities at a glance, including **scorecards, deployments, monitors, issues, incidents, dashboards**, and **on-call** status.  
- See all **tasks assigned to you** across GitHub and Jira.  
- Identify alerting monitors or faulty deployments quickly.

## View your team’s entities

{{< img src="tracing/eng_reports/team-overview-entities.png" alt="Team Overview showing service scorecards, incidents, and monitors" style="width:100%;" >}}  

The top section of the Team Overview displays a scoped-down view of your team’s key entities. This view automatically aggregates data from your linked Datadog products and integrations.

You can view the following fields for each service or entity:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Type** | The entity type (for example, Service, Monitor, Incident). |
| **Name** | The entity’s display name or identifier. |
| **Scorecards** | Summary of the service’s health based on reliability, performance, and error budgets. |
| **Last Deploy** | The most recent deployment detected by APM or CI integrations. |
| **Monitors** | Count and state of monitors affecting the service. |
| **Issues** | Active issues related to the service, aggregated from linked tracking tools. |
| **Incidents** | Open incidents associated with the team’s services. |
| **Dashboards** | Key dashboards linked to the service. |
| **On-Call** | The current on-call responder for the team or service. |

## Tasks assigned to you

The **Tasks** section consolidates your personal action items from GitHub so you can focus on what matters most.

### GitHub PRs
Displays pull requests that:
- **Needs your review**
- **Returned to you**

- **Recently merged**  


Each PR entry includes:

- **Title**  
- **Status** (Open / Draft / Merged)  
- **Assignee / Reviewer**  

If your organization hasn’t configured the GitHub integration yet, you’ll see an empty state with a prompt to enable it by visiting the [GitHub Integration tile][1].

### Jira Tasks (coming soon)
Lists Jira issues assigned to you, including:
- **Issue Number**  
- **Title**  
- **Status**  
- **Assignee**

If your organization hasn’t configured the Jira integration, you’ll see an empty state that directs you to the [Jira Integration tile][2] to complete setup.
