## Overview

Software Catalog uses definition schemas to store and display relevant metadata about your services. The schemas have built-in validation rules to ensure that only valid values are accepted. You can view warnings in the **Definition** tab on the Software Catalog side panel for any selected services.

{{< /callout >}}

## Supported versions

Datadog supports four versions of the definition schema:

- **v3.0**: Latest version with expanded data model, multi-ownership support, manual dependency declaration, and enhanced features for complex infrastructure.
- **v2.2**: Supports user annotations for custom metadata and CI pipeline associations to link services with their build processes.
- **v2.1**: Supports service groupings for improved organization and introduces additional fields for more comprehensive service descriptions.
- **v2**: Earliest supported version, providing essential fields for basic service metadata and documentation.

Each version builds upon the previous one, adding new functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility. Choose the version that best suits your needs and infrastructure complexity.

## Version comparison

The following features are supported in each version:

| Feature                       | v3.0  | v2.2      | v2.1      | v2.0        |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Basic Metadata                | {{< X >}}   | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} |
| Service Groupings             | {{< X >}}   | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} |           |
| User Annotations              | {{< X >}}   | {{< X >}} |           |           |
| CI Pipeline Associations      | {{< X >}}   | {{< X >}} |           |           |
| Expanded Data Model           | {{< X >}}   |           |           |           |
| Multi-ownership               | {{< X >}}   |           |           |           |
| Manual Dependency Declaration | {{< X >}}   |           |           |           |

For detailed information about each version, including full schemas and example YAML files, see the individual version pages in [Supported versions](#supported-versions).

{{% tab "v3.0" %}}

### Key features
- **Expanded data model**: v3.0 supports multiple kinds of entities. You can organize your systems using various components such as systems, services, queues, and datastores.
- **Multi-ownership**: You can assign multiple owners to any objects defined through the v3.0 schema to specify multiple points of contact.
- **Enhanced relationship mapping**: With APM and USM data, you can automatically detect dependencies among components. v3.0 supports manual declaration to augment auto-detected system topology to ensure a complete overview of how components interact within your systems.
- **Inheritance of system metadata**: Components within a system automatically inherit the system's metadata. It's no longer necessary to declare metadata for all related components one-by-one as in v2.1 and v2.2. 
- **Precise code location**: Add the mapping of your code location for your service. The `codeLocations` section in v3.0 specifies the locations of the code with the repository that contains the code and its associated `paths`. The `paths` attribute is a list of [globs][4] that should match paths in the repository.
- **Filtered logs & events**: Declare saved logs and event queries for a `system` through the `logs` and `events` sections and view results on the System page.  
- **(In Preview) Custom entities**: Define custom entity types beyond Service, System, Datastore, Queue, and API. Scope scorecards and actions to specific entity types.
- **(In Preview) Integrations**: Integrate with third-party tools to dynamically source information related to your components (for example, GitHub pull requests, PagerDuty incidents, and GitLab pipelines). Report on and write scorecard rules against any third-party source.
- **(In Preview) Group by product or domain**: Organize components by product, enabling multiple layers of hierarchical grouping.

### Schema structure

You can see the [full schema definitions on Github][1]. 

V3.0 contains the following changes from v2.2:
- `schema_version` is now `apiVersion`
- `kind` field is new and defines the type of component: service, queue, datastore, system, or API
- `dd-service` is now `metadata.name`
- `team` is now `owner` and `additionalOwners` if there are multiple teams
- `lifecycle`, `tier`, `languages`, and `type` are now under `spec`
- `links`, `contacts`, and `description`, and `tags` are now under metadata
- `application` has been enhanced to become its own kind: `system`. It no longer exists as a discrete field on a service.

{{% collapse-content title="Components that are part of multiple systems" level="h4" expanded=false id="id-for-anchoring" %}}
  If a single component is part of multiple systems, you must specify that component in the YAML for each system. For example, if the datastore `orders-postgres` is a component of both a postgres fleet and a web application, specify two YAMLs:

  For the postgres fleet (`managed-postgres`), specify a definition for `kind:system`:
  {{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}
  apiVersion: v3
  kind: system
  spec:
    components:
      - datastore:orders-postgres
      - datastore:foo-postgres
      - datastore:bar-postgres
  metadata:
    name: managed-postgres
    owner: db-team
  {{< /code-block >}}

  For the web application (`shopping-cart`), declare a separate definition for `kind:system`:
  {{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}

  apiVersion: v3
  kind: system
  spec:
    lifecycle: production
    tier: critical
    components:
      - service:shopping-cart-api
      - service:shopping-cart-processor
      - queue:orders-queue
      - datastore:orders-postgres
  metadata:
    name: shopping-cart
    owner: shopping-team
    additionalOwners:
      - name: sre-team
        type: operator
  ---
  apiVersion: v3
  kind: datastore
  metadata:
    name: orders-postgres
    additionalOwners:
      - name: db-team
        type: operator
  ---
  apiVersion: v3
  kind: service
  metadata:

### Explicit and implicit metadata inheritance 

#### Explicit inheritance 

The `inheritFrom` field instructs the ingestion pipeline to inherit metadata from the entity's metadata referenced by `<entity_kind>:<name>`.

{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="entity.datadog.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}
inheritFrom:<entity_kind>:<name>
{{< /code-block >}}

#### Implicit inheritance 
Components (`kind:service`, `kind:datastore`, `kind:queue`, `kind:ui`) inherit all metadata from the system that they belong to under the following conditions:
- There is only one system defined in the YAML file.
- The clause `inheritFrom:<entity_kind>:<name>` is absent in the YAML file.

### Migrating to v3.0
v3.0 supports the same methods of creating metadata as previous versions, including Github, API, Terraform, Backstage, ServiceNow, and the UI. However, there are new [API endpoints][5] and a new [Terraform module][6] for v3.0.

### API reference documentation
To create, get, and delete definitions for all entity types like endpoints, systems, datastores, and queues, see the [Software Catalog API reference][8].

## Build custom extensions

<div class="alert alert-info">Custom extensions are in Limited Availability.</div>

The `extensions` field is supported in all versions. You can incorporate this custom field into deployment processes to standardize and codify best practices.

          schedule: "0 9 * * 1"
{{< /code-block >}}


## Schema validation through IDE plugin 

Datadog provides a [JSON Schema][18] for definitions so that when you are editing a definition in a [supporting IDE][19], features such as autocomplete and validation are provided.

{{< img src="tracing/software_catalog/ide_plugin.png" alt="VSCode recognizing problem to fix" style="width:100%;" >}}

The [JSON schema for Datadog definitions][20] is registered with the open source [Schema Store][19].
