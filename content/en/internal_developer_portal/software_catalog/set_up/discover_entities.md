## Overview

Software Catalog automatically discovers entities from Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Universal Service Monitoring (USM), and Real User Monitoring (RUM). You can also configure it to import entities from infrastructure metrics and logs.

## Automatic discovery with APM, USM, and RUM 

Datadog Software Catalog is pre-populated with entries detected through [APM][1], eBPF-based autodiscovery with [Universal Service Monitoring][4], and RUM applications.

All automatically detected entities appear in the Component Selector within Software Catalog.

APM and USM automatically detect the following entities types: `service`,`datastore`, `queue`, `external providers`, `inferred services`, and `endpoints`. APM SDKs identify dependencies of instrumented services and classify them as databases, queues, or third-party APIsâ€”even if those dependencies are not directly instrumented. Custom instrumentation may affect how entities are auto-discovered and how the `service tag` is assigned. To learn more, see [APM Inferred Services][3].

RUM is responsible for discovering `frontend apps` entities.

**Managing automatically-named services:**
- You can opt-in to [inferred entities][3] to filter out entities by type (database, queue, third-party).
- You can optionally [remove service overrides][4] such as `service:my-service-http-client` from your catalog or map.

For information about discovering endpoints, see [Discovering Endpoints from APM][5].

**Note**: The [performance metrics][6] for an entity are tied to its [primary operations][7]. If a service is detected only by USM, the performance view shows [USM metrics][9]; if a entity is detected only by APM, or by both APM and USM, the performance view shows APM [trace metrics][8].


## Import entities from Infrastructure and Logs

You can import services from other Datadog telemetry containing the `DD_SERVICE` [tag][10] to populate the Software Catalog. To discover `kind:service` entities through Datadog infrastructure metrics or logs, navigate to the Software Catalog [**Import Entries** tab][11].

After importing, entries appear in the **Explore** tab. Entries may expire unless you add metadata, such as the owner or contacts, by [using the API][12] or the [GitHub integration][13].

To remove imported services from the default **Explore** view, click **Clear Previously Imported Services** on the [**Import Entries** tab][11]. This removes all services that do not have metadata or do not have APM, Universal Service Monitoring (USM), or Real User Monitoring (RUM) telemetry.
