## Enrich auto-detected services with metadata 
To specify on-call, source code, or documentation for your services, you can add metadata to any existing services using the UI, APIs, or [other automation][10]. v3 is the recommended version.

### Entity Definition Schema (v3) (Recommended)
The Entity Definition Schema is a structure that contains basic information about a software component. 

For more details, see the [Definition Schema v3.0][3].

### Service Definition Schema (v2.2)

The Service Definition Schema is a structure that contains basic information about a service. See the [full schema on GitHub][5].
