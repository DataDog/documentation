## Overview

Campaigns help you coordinate time-bound engineering initiatives by grouping Scorecard rules under a single goal and tracking adoption across entities and teams. 

While Scorecards define long-term best practices, Campaigns allow you to drive short-term efforts such as runtime migrations, security remediations, or cost optimization pushes by highlighting what matters most right now. You can set a deadline, select relevant rules, and monitor completion across teams. 

You can create and manage Campaigns from the Campaigns tab on the Scorecards page in the Internal Developer Portal. From here, you can: 
- View all active and past campaigns
- See initiative-level progress at a glance
- Filter by rule, team, or status
- Follow up with teams directly

If your service is affected by a campaign, you will see related campaign rules and deadlines directly in the Software Catalog on your entity's Scorecards tab and on the entity's page in the Scorecards section. This visibility helps ensure your team can take action without relying on manual reminders or tracking external documentation.
