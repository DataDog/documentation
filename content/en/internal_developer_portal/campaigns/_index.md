## Overview

Campaigns let you coordinate short-term engineering initiatives by grouping [Scorecard][1] rules under a shared goal and tracking adoption across entities and teams. 

While Scorecards define long-term best practices, campaigns help you focus efforts on time-bound initiatives such as runtime migrations, security remediations, or cost optimization. You can set a deadline, select rules to track, and monitor completion across teams.

Use the [**Campaigns** tab on the Scorecards page][2] to: 
- View active and past campaigns
- Track progress by rule, team, or status
- Follow up with teams directly from the interface 

If your service is part of a campaign, related rules and deadlines appear in the entity's **Scorecards** tab in Software Catalog, and on the entity page in the **Scorecards** section. This visibility lets teams act on campaign goals without relying on manual reminders or external documentation.

## Creating a campaign

Create and manage campaigns from the [**Campaigns** tab in Scorecards][2].

### 1. Define campaign metadata

Provide the following information:
- **Name**: A short, descriptive title (for example, "Migrate to GitHub Actions")
- **Key**: A unique identifier for the campaign (auto-generated by default)
- **Description**: A short summary of the campaign's goal
- **Owner**: The team responsible for driving the campaign
- **Start and end date**: The campaign timeline (end date is optional)
- **Scope**: Entities the campaign applies to (for example, `kind:service AND tier:1`)

### 2. Select Scorecard rules

Add one or more [existing Scorecard rules][3] that align with your campaign's goal.

### 3. Define guidance

For each rule, optionally include: 
- Linked documentation
- Workflows through [Workflow Automation][4] to automatically remediate failing rules
- Steps teams should follow to meet compliance

## Tracking campaign progress

After creating a campaign, use the campaign page to monitor adoption and follow up as needed.

From the campaign page, you can: 
- See overall completion and progress by team or rule
- Filter to find entities, teams, or rules that are still failing
- Compare adoption rates across teams
- View progress trends over time
- Send updates or create follow-up tickets directly from the page
