## Overview

Campaigns help you coordinate time-bound engineering initiatives by grouping Scorecard rules under a single goal and tracking adoption across entities and teams. 

While [Scorecards][1] define long-term best practices, Campaigns allow you to drive short-term efforts such as runtime migrations, security remediations, or cost optimization pushes by highlighting what matters most right now. You can set a deadline, select relevant rules, and monitor completion across teams. 

You can create and manage Campaigns from the [Campaigns tab on the Scorecards page][2] in the Internal Developer Portal. From here, you can: 
- View all active and past campaigns
- See initiative-level progress at a glance
- Filter by rule, team, or status
- Follow up with teams directly

If your service is affected by a campaign, you will see related campaign rules and deadlines directly in the Software Catalog on your entity's Scorecards tab and on the entity's page in the Scorecards section. This visibility helps ensure your team can take action without relying on manual reminders or tracking external documentation. 

## Creating a Campaign

You can create and manage Campaigns from the Campaigns tab in Scorecards.

#### 1. Define Campaign Metadata

When creating a campaign, you'll be asked to provide:
- Name: A short, descriptive title (e.g., "Migrate to GitHub Actions")
- Key: A unique identifier for the campaign used in URLs and when making API calls. This is auto-generated by default but can be customized. 
- Description: A few sentences about the goal of the campaign
- Owner: Team responsible for driving the campaign
- Start and (optional) end date: The timeline for when work should be completed
- Scope: Which entities the campaign applies to (e.g., `kind:service AND tier:1`)

#### 2. Select Scorecard Rules

Choose one or more existing Scorecard rules that are relevant to the campaign's goal. [These rules must already be defined in Scorecards][3] before they can be included in a campaign. 

#### 3. Define Guidance

For each rule, you can optionally provide: 
- Linked documentation
- Workflows through [Workflow Automation][4] to automatically remediate failing rules
- Steps teams should follow to become compliant

## Tracking Campaign Progress

Once a campaign is created, the campaign page helps you stay on top of adoption and follow-through as work progresses.

From this page, you can: 

- Monitor campaign progress at a glance, including how many entities and teams have completed their work
- Filter and investigate specific entities, teams, or rules that are still outstanding
- Identify bottlenecks early by comparing adoption across teams through a team leaderboard
- Track momentum with historical progress over time
- Take follow-up actions, like sending status updates or creating tickets for unblocked work
