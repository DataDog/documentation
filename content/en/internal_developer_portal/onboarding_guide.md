## Overview

This onboarding guide walks platform and engineering leaders through the phases of implementing Datadog's Internal Developer Portal (IDP).  

Recommendations:
- Onboard one or two teams first, and use their feedback to refine standards.  
- Iterate regularlyâ€”treat your Internal Developer Portal as a product.  
- Connect IDP standards with other initiatives, such as SLOs, CI/CD pipelines, and incident workflows.  

## Phase 1: Plan your implementation

1. **Review key concepts**: Learn about the [Entity model][2], [Scorecards][3], and [Self-service Actions][4].  
1. **Bring in your organization's structure**: Set up [Teams][5] and mirror your hierarchy in Datadog.  
1. **Define your ontology**: Map your existing systems to the [Entity model][2] so your structure aligns with Datadog's schema. Decide which [entity types][6] and validations you want to enforce.

## Phase 2: Familiarize yourself with tooling

1. **Identify data sources**: Learn about the three ways to bring in entities, and decide what to use as sources of truth for your [Software Catalog][7]:

   - **[Automatically discover entries from Datadog][23]** products, such as APM, RUM, or USM. You can also import from Infrastructure or Log Management.
   - **Import from external systems** such as [Backstage][14] or [ServiceNow][15].  
   - **[Create entries directly][24]** through the Datadog UI, or programmatically by importing from GitHub, Terraform, the Datadog Software Metadata Provider, or the Service Definition API.  

  **Note**: If you use APM, prioritize [Unified Service Tagging][13] and [Inferred Services][14] as entry points, rather than relying on service overrides.

1. **Create internal onboarding guidance**: Document tagging standards, sample `entity.definition.yaml` files, and expectations for application teams.  
1. **Explore automation**: Use the [API][8] or Terraform provider to manage entities, scorecards, and workflows programmatically.

## Phase 3: Integrate data sources

1. **Adopt GitOps-style management**: [Connect GitHub][13] or other repos to manage your catalog. [Import existing Backstage manifests][14] if available.  
1. **[Import from ServiceNow][15]**: Sync CIs from your ServiceNow CMDB into IDP.  
1. **Connect on-call and incident tools**: Configure [Jira][9], [PagerDuty][10], or [other integrations][16].

## Phase 4: Customize and extend schema

1. **Establish entity definition standards**: Decide how you represent criticality, lifecycle, and environments. See [Entity Model][6] for definition schemas. 
1. **Set metadata expectations**: Decide on whether to include [custom tags and extensions][18]. Determine how to define relationships between components, and how to audit automatically detected relationships.
1. **Maintain internal guidance**: Keep documentation for developers, such as standards for instrumentation and tagging, and sample entity definition manifests.

## Phase 5: Establish and communicate standards

1. **Review recommended Scorecards**: Start with [Datadog's out-of-the-box rules][3]. Select those relevant to your organization.
1. **Add organization-specific rules**: [Extend scorecards][19] with custom security checks, deployment frequency requirements, or tagging standards.  
1. **Set levels of criticality**: [Group rules into levels][20] to signal importance.

## Phase 6: Set up golden paths

1. **Review example blueprints**: Explore [Self-service blueprints][11], which show example paths for infrastructure provisioning and management, project scaffolding, and more. Experiment with modifying the blueprints to fit your organization's stack.
1. **Explore the Action Catalog**: See supported integrations, or extend with [HTTP requests and private actions][4].  
1. **Publish your first workflow**: Build a golden path and iterate based on developer feedback.

## Phase 7: Explore engineering reports

1. **Track progress**: Use built-in [Engineering Reports][12] to monitor production readiness, reliability, and adoption of best practices.  
1. **Measure engagement**: Monitor developer engagement through the built-in usage analytics dashboard.
