## API discovery and usability:

- Developers: Quickly access API documentation, code snippets, rate limits, health metrics, and reliability scores to streamline the integration of APIs into their applications and promote the reuse of existing APIs across projects.
- Platform Engineers and Managers: Direct teams to leverage existing APIs for building new features or services, reducing redundancy, saving time, and improving efficiency.

## API ownership and accountability:

- Developers: Monitor API health and usage, streamline communications with API consumers, and assume full ownership of their APIs.
- Platform Engineers and Managers:  Promote a culture of accountability by providing tools for developers to manage their APIs and ensure reliability.

## API governance at scale:

- Developers: Receive clear feedback on adherence to quality, security, and governance standards.
- Platform Engineers and Managers: Establish and uphold API standards to ensure high-quality APIs throughout the organization.
