## Setup

### Test visibility setup

Prior to setting up Intelligent Test Runner, set up [Test Visibility for Javascript and Typescript][2]. If you are reporting data through the Agent, use v6.40+/v7.40+.

{{% ci-itr-activation-instructions %}}

### Configuring the test runner environment

{{< tabs >}}

{{% tab "On-Premises CI Provider (Datadog Agent)" %}}

{{% ci-itr-agent %}}

After configuring the Datadog Agent, run your tests as you normally do:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
NODE_OPTIONS="-r dd-trace/ci/init" DD_ENV=ci DD_SERVICE=my-javascript-app yarn test
{{< /code-block >}}
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Cloud CI provider (Agentless)" %}}

{{% ci-itr-agentless %}}

After setting these environment variables, run your tests as you normally do:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
NODE_OPTIONS="-r dd-trace/ci/init" DD_ENV=ci DD_SERVICE=my-javascript-app DD_CIVISIBILITY_AGENTLESS_ENABLED=true DD_API_KEY=$DD_API_KEY DD_APPLICATION_KEY=$DD_APPLICATION_KEY yarn test
{{< /code-block >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### Cypress setup

For Intelligent Test Runner for Cypress to work, you must instrument your web application with code coverage. You can read more about enabling code coverage in the [Cypress documentation][3]. To check that you've successfully enabled code coverage, navigate to your web app with Cypress and check the global variable `window.__coverage__`. This is what `dd-trace` uses to collect code coverage for Intelligent Test Runner.


#### Suite skipping
Intelligent Test Runner for Javascript skips entire _test suites_ (test files) rather than individual tests.
