## Compatibility

Intelligent Test Runner is only supported on `dd-sdk-swift>= 2.2.0`.

## Setup

Prior to setting up Intelligent Test Runner, set up [Test Visibility for Swift][1]. The **code coverage** option must also be enabled in the test settings of your scheme or test plan, or --enable-code-coverage must be added to your Swift test command (if using a SPM target).

If you are reporting data through the Agent, use v6.40+/v7.40+.

To enable Intelligent Test Runner, set the following environment variables:

`DD_TEST_RUNNER`
: Enables or disables the instrumentation of tests. Set this value to `$(DD_TEST_RUNNER)` so you can enable and disable test instrumentation with a environment variable defined outside of the test process (for example, in the CI build).<br/>
**Default**: `false`<br/>
**Recommended**: `$(DD_TEST_RUNNER)`

`DD_APPLICATION_KEY` (Required)
: The [Datadog Application key][2] used to query the tests to be skipped.<br/>
**Default**: `(empty)`

#### UI activation
In addition to setting the environment variables, you or a user in your organization with "Intelligent Test Runner Activation" permissions must activate the Intelligent Test Runner on the [Test Service Settings][3] page.
