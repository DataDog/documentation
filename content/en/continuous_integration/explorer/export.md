Click the **Export** button on the right hand corner and select an option from the dropdown menu:

- Share your [view][7] of the [CI Visibility Explorer][3].
- Export your search results to a [monitor][5] that triggers alerts on predefined thresholds.
- Export your search results to an [existing notebook][6] for reporting or consolidation purposes.
- Download your search results as a CSV file for individual CI Visibility test or pipeline events and specific aggregations.

Options available for some visualization types are not supported in others. For example, you cannot download a distribution graph into a CSV file.
