* GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) 3.5.0 or above


## Configuring the Datadog integration

### Configuring a GitHub App

The [GitHub Actions][1] integration uses a private [GitHub App][2] to collect workflow information. If you already have an app, you can
skip to the next section.

1. Go to the [GitHub Apps Integration tile][3].
2. Click **Link GitHub Account**.
3. Follow the instructions to configure the integration for a personal or organization account.
4. In **Edit Permissions**, grant `Actions: Read` access.
5. Click **Create App in GitHub** to finish the app creation process GitHub.
6. Give the app a name, for example, `Datadog CI Visibility`.
7. Click **Install GitHub App** and follow the instructions on GitHub.

### Configure tracing for GitHub Actions

After the GitHub App is created and installed, enable CI Visibility on the accounts and/or repositories you want visibility into.

1. Go to the **[Getting Started][4]** page and click on **GitHub**.
2. Click on **Enable Account** for the account you want to enable.
3. Enable CI Visibility for the whole account by clicking **Enable CI Visibility**.
4. Alternatively, you can enable individual repositories by scrolling through the repository list and clicking the **Enable CI Visibility** toggle.

Pipelines appear immediately after enabling CI Visibility for any account or repository.

### Enable log collection

The GitHub Actions CI Visibility integration also allows automatically forwarding workflow job logs to the [Logs Product][5].
To enable logs, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **[CI Visibility settings][6]** page.
2. Click on any account that is enabled or has enabled repositories.
3. Click **Enable Job Logs Collection** to enable logs for the whole account.
4. Alternatively, you can enable individual repositories by scrolling through the repository list and clicking the **Enable Job Logs Collection** toggle.

Immediately after toggling logs collection, workflow job logs are forwarded to Datadog Logs. Note that logs are billed separately from CI Visibility. Log retention, exclusion, and indexes are configured in Logs Settings.

### Infrastructure metric correlation

If you are using self-hosted GitHub runners, you can correlate jobs to the host that is running them. To do this, make sure the GitHub runner name
matches the hostname of the machine it is running on. CI Visibility uses this to link to
infrastructure metrics. To see the metrics, click on a job span in the trace view and in the window a new tab named **Infrastructure** is
shown which contains the host metrics.

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][7] and [Pipeline Executions][8] pages populate with data after the pipelines finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.

## Disabling GitHub Actions tracing

To disable the CI Visibility GitHub Actions integration, make sure the GitHub app is no longer subscribed to the
workflow job and workflow run events. To remove the events:

1. Go to the [GitHub Apps][9] page.
2. Click **Edit > Permission & events** on the relevant Datadog GitHub App (if you have multiple apps, you will have to repeat the process for each).
3. Scroll to the **Subscribe to events** section, and make sure that **Workflow job** and **Workflow run** are not selected.
