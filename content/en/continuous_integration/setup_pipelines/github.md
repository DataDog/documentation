## Compatibility

Supported GitHub versions:

## Configuring the Datadog integration

The [GitHub Actions][1] integration uses a private [GitHub App][2] to collect workflow information. To create the app:

1. Go to the [GitHub Apps Integration tile][3].
2. Click **Link GitHub Account**.
3. Follow the instructions to configure the integration for a personal or organization account.
4. In **Edit Permissions**, grant `Actions: Read` access.
5. Click **Create App in GitHub** to finish the app creation process GitHub.
6. Give the app a name, for example, `Datadog CI Visibility`.
7. Click **Install GitHub App** and follow the instructions on GitHub.

After the GitHub App is created and installed, recently finished GitHub Actions workflows appear in CI Visibility pages.

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][4] and [Pipeline Executions][5] pages populate with data after the pipelines finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.

## Disabling GitHub Actions tracing

To disable the CI Visibility GitHub Actions integration, make sure the GitHub app is no longer subscribed to the
workflow job and workflow run events. To remove the events:

1. Go to the [GitHub Apps][6] page.
2. Click **Edit > Permission & events** on the relevant Datadog GitHub App (if you have multiple apps, you will have to repeat the process for each).
3. Scroll to the **Subscribe to events** section, and make sure that **Workflow job** and **Workflow run** are not selected.
