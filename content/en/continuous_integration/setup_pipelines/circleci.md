## Configure the Datadog integration

The Datadog integration for [CircleCI][1] works by using [webhooks][2] to send data to Datadog.

1. For each project, go to **Project Settings > Webhooks** in CircleCI and add a new webhook:
   * **Webhook URL**: <code>https://webhook-intake.{{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}/api/v2/webhook/?dd-api-key=<API_KEY></code> where `<API_KEY>` is your [Datadog API key][3].
   * **Name**: `Datadog CI Visibility` or any other identifier name that you want to provide.
   * **Events**: Select `Workflow Completed` and `Job Completed`.
   * **Certificate verifications**: Enable this check.

2. Click **Add Webhook** to save the new webhook.

### Setting custom tags
To set custom tags to all the pipeline and job spans generated by the integration, add to the **Webhook URL** a URL-encoded query parameter `tags`, with `key:value` pairs separated by commas. If a key:value pair contains any commas, surround it with quotes. For example, to add `key1:value1,"key2: value with , comma",key3:value3`, the following string would need to be appended to the **Webhook URL**:

`?tags=key1%3Avalue1%2C%22key2%3A+value+with+%2C+comma%22%2Ckey3%3Avalue3`

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][4] and [Pipeline Executions][5] pages populate with data after the workflows finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.
