Datadog integrates with GitHub to show test result summaries and error messages for failed tests in pull request comments.

### Compatibility
This integration is only available for test services hosted on `github.com`. It is also unavailable for workflows running on `pull_request` triggers.

### Enabling
To enable the GitHub comments integration:

1. Go to the [GitHub App integration tile][1] and install the [Datadog GitHub App][2].
2. Give the application read and write permissions for pull requests.

In the UI, you can do this from the settings page or the commit or branch page.

#### CI Settings page

1. Go to the [CI Test Service Settings page][3] and search for the repository or test service.
2. Toggle the `GitHub Comments` column for the desired service.

#### Commit or branch page

1. Go to the test service commit or branch page where you would like to enable GitHub comments.
2. Click on the settings icon at the top right.
3. Select `Enable GitHub Comments` so that comments display on new pull requests. Note that this change takes a few minutes.

Comments only appear on pull requests that were opened before the test run and that have run at least one test for an enabled test service.
