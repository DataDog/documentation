## Overview

[GitLab][18] is a DevOps platform that automates the software development lifecycle with integrated CI/CD features, enabling automated, continuous deployment of applications with built-in security controls.

Set up CI Visibility for GitLab to collect data on your pipeline executions, analyze performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot operational issues, and optimize your deployment workflows.

### Compatibility

| Pipeline Visibility | Platform | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| [Running pipelines][24] | Running pipelines | View pipeline executions that are running. Queued or waiting pipelines show with status "Running" on Datadog. |
| [CI jobs failure analysis][28] | CI jobs failure analysis | Analysis of the root causes of failed CI jobs based on relevant logs using LLM models. |
| [Filter CI Jobs on the critical path][29] | Filter CI Jobs on the critical path | Filter by jobs on the critical path. |
| [Partial retries][19] | Partial pipelines | View partially retried pipeline executions. |
| [Manual steps][20] | Manual steps | View manually triggered pipelines. |
| [Queue time][21] | Queue time | View the amount of time pipeline jobs sit in the queue before processing. |
| Logs correlation | Logs correlation | Correlate pipeline spans to logs and enable [job log collection][12]. |
| Infrastructure metric correlation | Infrastructure metric correlation | Correlate jobs to [infrastructure host metrics][14] for self-hosted GitLab runners. |
| Custom pre-defined tags | Custom pre-defined tags | Set [custom tags][10] to all generated pipeline, stages, and job spans. |
| [Custom tags][15] [and measures at runtime][16] | Custom tags and measures at runtime | Configure [custom tags and measures][13] at runtime. |
| Parameters | Parameters | Set custom `env` or `service` parameters when a pipeline is triggered. |
| [Pipeline failure reasons][11] | Pipeline failure reasons | Identify pipeline failure reasons from [error messages][15]. |
| [Approval wait time][22] | Approval wait time  | View the amount of time jobs and pipelines wait for manual approvals. |
| [Execution time][23] | Execution time  | View the amount of time pipelines have been running jobs. Gitlab refers to this metric as `duration`. Duration in Gitlab and execution time may show different values. Gitlab does not take into consideration jobs that failed due to certain kinds of failures (such as runner system failures). |
| [Custom spans][25] | Custom spans | Configure custom spans for your pipelines. |

The following GitLab versions are supported:

- GitLab.com (SaaS)
- GitLab >= 14.1 (self-hosted)
- GitLab >= 13.7.0 (self-hosted) with the `datadog_ci_integration` feature flag enabled

### Terminology

This table shows the mapping of concepts between Datadog CI Visibility and GitLab:

| Datadog                    | GitLab   |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Pipeline                   | Pipeline |
| Stage                      | Stage    |
| Job                        | Job      |
| _Not available in Datadog_ | Script   |

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "GitLab &lt; 14.1" %}}

Enable the `datadog_ci_integration` [feature flag][101] to activate the integration.

Run one of the following commands, which use GitLab's [Rails Runner][102], depending on your installation type:

From **Omnibus Installations**:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
sudo gitlab-rails runner "Feature.enable(:datadog_ci_integration)"
{{< /code-block >}}

From **Source Installations**:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rails runner \
  -e production \
  "Feature.enable(:datadog_ci_integration)"
{{< /code-block >}}

From **Kubernetes Installations**:

{{< code-block lang="shell" >}}
kubectl exec -it <task-runner-pod-name> -- \
  /srv/gitlab/bin/rails runner "Feature.enable(:datadog_ci_integration)"
{{< /code-block >}}

Then, configure the integration on a [project][103] by going to **Settings > Integrations > Datadog** for each project you want to instrument.

<div class="alert alert-warning">Due to a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335218">bug</a> in early versions of GitLab, the Datadog integration cannot be enabled at <strong>group or instance</strong> level on <strong>GitLab versions < 14.1</strong>, even if the option is available on GitLab's UI.</div>


Fill in the integration configuration settings:

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "GitLab &lt; 13.7" %}}

<div class="alert alert-danger">Direct support with webhooks is not under development. Unexpected issues could happen. Datadog recommends that you update GitLab instead.</div>

For older versions of GitLab, you can use [webhooks][101] to send pipeline data to Datadog.

Go to **Settings > Webhooks** in your repository (or GitLab instance settings), and add a new webhook:

- **URL**: <code>https://webhook-intake.{{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}/api/v2/webhook/?dd-api-key=<API_KEY></code> where `<API_KEY>` is your [Datadog API key][102].
- **Secret Token**: Leave this field empty.
- **Trigger**: Select `Job events` and `Pipeline events`.

To set custom `env` or `service` parameters, add more query parameters in the webhooks URL. For example, `&env=<YOUR_ENV>&service=<YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>`.

### Set custom tags

To set custom tags to all the pipeline and job spans generated by the integration, add a URL-encoded query parameter `tags` with `key:value` pairs separated by commas to the URL.

If a key:value pair contains any commas, surround it with quotes. For example, to add `key1:value1,"key2: value with , comma",key3:value3`, the following string would need to be appended to the **Webhook URL**: `?tags=key1%3Avalue1%2C%22key2%3A+value+with+%2C+comma%22%2Ckey3%3Avalue3`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Advanced configuration

### Set custom tags

You can set custom tags for all pipeline and job spans from your GitLab projects to improve traceability. For more information, see [Custom Tags and Measures][13].

#### Integrate with Datadog Teams

To display and filter the teams associated with your pipelines, add `team:<your-team>` as a custom tag. The custom tag name must match your [Datadog Teams][16] team handle exactly.

### Correlate infrastructure metrics to jobs

If you are using self-hosted GitLab runners, you can correlate jobs with the infrastructure that is running them.

Datadog infrastructure correlation is possible using different methods:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Non autoscaling executors" %}}
The GitLab runner must have a tag in the form `host:<hostname>`. Tags can be added while [registering a new runner][1]. As a result, this method is only available when the runner is directly running the job.

This excludes executors that are autoscaling the infrastructure in order to run the job (such as the Kubernetes, Docker Autoscaler, or Instance executors) as it is not possible to add tags dynamically for those runners.

For existing runners:

- GitLab >= 15.8: Add tags through the UI by going to **Settings > CI/CD > Runners** and editing the appropriate runner.

- GitLab < 15.8: Add tags by updating the runner's `config.toml`. Or add tags through the UI by going to **Settings > CI/CD > Runners** and editing the appropriate runner.

After these steps, CI Visibility adds the hostname to each job. To see the metrics, click on a job span in the trace view. In the drawer, a new tab named **Infrastructure** appears which contains the host metrics.

[1]: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Docker Autoscaler" %}}
CI Visibility supports Infrastructure metrics for "Docker Autoscaler" executors. For more information, see the [Correlate Infrastructure Metrics with GitLab Jobs guide][1].

[1]: /continuous_integration/guides/infrastructure_metrics_with_gitlab
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Instance" %}}
CI Visibility supports Infrastructure metrics for "Instance" executors. For more information, see the [Correlate Infrastructure Metrics with GitLab Jobs guide][1].

[1]: /continuous_integration/guides/infrastructure_metrics_with_gitlab
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}
CI Visibility supports Infrastructure metrics for the Kubernetes executor. For this, it is necessary to have the Datadog Agent monitoring the Kubernetes Gitlab infrastructure. See [Install the Datadog Agent on Kubernetes][1] to install the Datadog Agent in a Kubernetes cluster.

Due to limitations in the Datadog Agent, jobs shorter than the minimum collection interval of the Datadog Agent might not always display infrastructure correlation metrics. To adjust this value, see [Datadog Agent configuration template][2] and adjust the variable `min_collection_interval` to be less than 15 seconds.

[1]: /containers/kubernetes/installation/?tab=datadogoperator
[2]: https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/pkg/config/config_template.yaml
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Other executors" %}}
CI Visibility does not support Infrastructure metrics for other executors.
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### View error messages for pipeline failures

For failed GitLab pipeline executions, each error under the `Errors` tab within a specific pipeline execution displays a message associated with the error type from GitLab.

{{< img src="ci/ci_gitlab_failure_reason_new.png" alt="GitLab Failure Reason" style="width:100%;">}}

#### CI jobs failure analysis

If job logs collection is enabled, CI Visibility computes analysis using LLM models for failed CI jobs based on relevant logs coming from GitLab.

You can also add job failure analysis to a PR comment. See the guide on [using PR comments][30].

For a full explanation, see the guide on [using CI jobs failure analysis][28].

#### Errors provided by GitLab

Error messages are supported for GitLab versions 15.2.0 and above.

The error information provided by GitLab is stored in `error.provider_message` and `error.provider_domain` tags.

The following table describes the message and domain correlated with each error type. Any unlisted error type results in a `Job failed` error message and an `unknown` error domain.

| Error Type                       | Error Domain | Error Message                                              |

### Collect job logs

The following GitLab versions support collecting job logs:

* GitLab.com (SaaS)
* GitLab >= 15.3 (self-hosted) only if you are using [object storage to store job logs][7]
* GitLab >= 14.8 (self-hosted) by enabling the `datadog_integration_logs_collection` feature flag

Job logs are collected in [Log Management][9] and are automatically correlated with the GitLab pipeline in CI Visibility. Log files larger than one GiB are truncated.

To enable collection of job logs:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "GitLab.com" %}}
1. Click the **Enable job logs collection** checkbox in the GitLab integration **Settings > Integrations > Datadog**.
2. Click **Save changes**.
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "GitLab &gt;&equals; 15.3" %}}
<div class="alert alert-danger">Datadog downloads log files directly from your GitLab logs <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/job_artifacts.html#using-object-storage">object storage</a> with temporary pre-signed URLs.
This means that for Datadog servers to access the storage, the storage must not have network restrictions
The <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#amazon-s3">endpoint</a>, if set, should resolve to a publicly accessible URL.</div>

1. Click **Enable job logs collection** checkbox in the GitLab integration under **Settings > Integrations > Datadog**.
2. Click **Save changes**.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "GitLab &gt;&equals; 14.8" %}}

This means that for Datadog servers to access the storage, the storage must not have network restrictions
The <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#amazon-s3">endpoint</a>, if set, should resolve to a publicly accessible URL.</div>

1. Enable the `datadog_integration_logs_collection` [feature flag][1] in your GitLab. This allows you to see the **Enable job logs collection** checkbox in the GitLab integration under **Settings > Integrations > Datadog**.
2. Click **Enable job logs collection**.
3. Click **Save changes**.

[1]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/feature_flags.html
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Logs are billed separately from CI Visibility. Log retention, exclusion, and indexes are configured in [Log Management][6]. Logs for GitLab jobs can be identified by the `datadog.product:cipipeline` and `source:gitlab` tags.

For more information about processing job logs collected from the GitLab integration, see the [Processors documentation][17].

## View partial and downstream pipelines

You can use the following filters to customize your search query in the [CI Visibility Explorer][26].

{{< img src="ci/partial_retries_search_tags.png" alt="The Pipeline executions page with Partial Pipeline:retry entered in the search query" style="width:100%;">}}

| Facet Name | Facet ID | Possible Values |
|---|---|---|
| Downstream Pipeline | `@ci.pipeline.downstream` | `true`, `false` |
| Manually Triggered | `@ci.is_manual` | `true`, `false` |
| Partial Pipeline | `@ci.partial_pipeline` | `retry`, `paused`, `resumed` |

You can also apply these filters using the facet panel on the left hand side of the page.

{{< img src="ci/partial_retries_facet_panel.png" alt="The facet panel with Partial Pipeline facet expanded and the value Retry selected, the Partial Retry facet expanded and the value true selected" style="width:20%;">}}

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

Once the integration is successfully configured, the [**CI Pipeline List**][4] and [**Executions**][5] pages populate with data after the pipelines finish.

The **CI Pipeline List** page shows data for only the default branch of each repository. For more information, see [Search and Manage CI Pipelines][27].
