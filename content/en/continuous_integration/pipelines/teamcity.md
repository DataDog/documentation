## Compatibility

- **Supported TeamCity versions**: 2021.2 or later

- **Partial retries**: View partially retried pipeline executions

- **Queue time**: View amount of time pipeline jobs sit in the queue before processing

- **Pipeline failure reasons**: Identify pipeline failure reasons from error messages

## Configure the Datadog integration

The integration between [TeamCity][1] and Datadog CI Visibility is provided through a TeamCity plugin.
To activate the integration:
1. Download the [Datadog CI Integration plugin][5] on the TeamCity server by going to
**Administration** -> **Plugins** -> **Browse Plugin Repository**.
2. If you don't already have one, add a [TeamCity composite build][6] as the last build of the build chain. This build must have
a dependency on the current last build of the chain and no other builds depending on it. Build chains not having a
composite build as their last build are ignored by the plugin. Below is an example of an expected build chain,
in which `Aggregating Results` is the last composite build:
{{< img src="ci/teamcity_build_chain.png" alt="TeamCity build chain with composite build at the end" style="width:90%;">}}
The final composite build must be properly configured in terms of version control settings, with
the VCS Root attached and the [VCS Trigger][13] configured.
3. The following configuration parameters need to be present for TeamCity projects:
   * **datadog.ci.api.key**: Your [Datadog API Key][2].
   * **datadog.ci.site**: {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}.
   * **datadog.ci.enabled**: `true` (`false`
   can be used to disable the plugin for a specific project).

   These configuration parameters can be added either to TeamCity subprojects
   or to the [TeamCity Root Project][10]. When added to the Root project, they are propagated
   to all its subprojects. For example, to enable the plugin for all projects, add **datadog.ci.enabled** with the
   value `true` to the Root Project. More information on defining configuration parameters
   is available in the [TeamCity Project Hierarchy][9] documentation.
4. To enable the plugin, click on **Enable uploaded plugins** in the **Administration** -> **Plugins** page.
Alternatively, restart the TeamCity server.

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

View your data on the [Pipelines][3] and [Pipeline Executions][4] pages after the pipelines finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page only shows data for the [default branch][12] of each repository.

## Configure Git user information

The plugin retrieves the Git author name and email based on the [TeamCity username style][7].
Datadog recommends using either **Author Name and Email** or **Author Email** username styles, as they
provide information about the user email. When one of the other username styles is used (**UserId** or **Author Name**),
the plugin automatically generates an email for the user by appending `@Teamcity` to the username.
For example, if the **UserId** username style is used and the Git author username is `john.doe`,
the plugin generates `john.doe@Teamcity` as the Git author email. The username style is defined for [VCS Roots][11],
and can be modified in the VCS Root settings.

<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> The Git author email is used for
<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/?product=ci-visibility#ci-visibility" target="_blank">billing</a> purposes,
therefore there might be cost implications when username styles not providing email
(<strong>UserId</strong> or <strong>Author Name</strong>) are used. <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/" target="_blank">Reach out to the Datadog support team</a> if you have any questions about your use case.
</div>

## Plugin repository

The [source code][8] of the Datadog CI Integration plugin is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Troubleshooting

All the logs generated by the Datadog CI Integration plugin are stored inside the `teamcity-server.log` file and can be
accessed from the TeamCity Server by going to **Administration** -> **Diagnostic** -> **Server Logs**.
Check these logs to get additional context on any issues with the plugin.
