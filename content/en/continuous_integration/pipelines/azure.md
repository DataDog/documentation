## Overview

[Azure Pipelines][1] is a continuous integration and delivery service that supports any language, platform, or cloud. 

Set up tracing on Azure Pipelines to gain real time insights into your CI/CD workflows, track pipeline performance, analyze inefficiencies, and manage your deployment operations.

### Compatibility

| Pipeline Visibility | Platform | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| [Custom tags][10] [and measures at runtime][11] | Custom tags and measures at runtime | Configure [custom tags and measures][6] at runtime. |

## Configure the Datadog integration

The Datadog integration for [Azure Pipelines][1] works by using [service hooks][2] to send data to Datadog.

1. Install the [Datadog CI Visibility][8] extension from the Azure Marketplace. There are several extensions starting with **Datadog**, make sure that you are installing the [Datadog CI Visibility][8] extension.

2. For each project, go to **Project settings > Service hooks** in Azure DevOps and select the green plus (+) icon to create a subscription.

3. Create a new subscription to the `Datadog CI Visibility` service for each of the following webhook types:
    - **Run state changed**
    - **Run stage state changed**
    - **Run job state changed**
    - **Run stage approval completed**
    - **Run stage waiting for approval**

4. Click **Next** to continue to the next step and set the following:
    - **Datadog Site**: {{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}
    - **Datadog API Key**: your [Datadog API key][3].

5. Click **Finish**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
All 5 supported types of events are required and must be enabled individually.
Not enabling one or more events results in an an incomplete installation, leading to unexpected behavior in Datadog.
</div>

### Configuring multiple projects in bulk


If you want to enable the hooks for many or all your Azure projects, Datadog provides a [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/ci-visibility-azure-pipelines/main/service_hooks.py) to help you do it through the Azure API.

To run the script, you need:

- An Azure DevOps username
- An Azure DevOps [API Token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows#create-a-pat)
- An Azure DevOps organization name

The script only needs python3 and the requests package. For more info, run:
```shell
./service_hooks.py --help
```

The script supports environment variables `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_SITE`, and flag parameters `--dd-api-key` and `--dd-site`.

Example for enabling the hooks in all projects:
```
./service_hooks.py \
    --dd-api-key ******************** \
    --az-user "John Doe" \
    --az-token ********************** \
    --az-org datadoghq \
    --threads 4
```

Example for enabling the hooks in specified projects:
```
./service_hooks.py \
    --dd-api-key ******************** \
    --az-user "John Doe" \
    --az-token ********************** \
    --az-org datadoghq \
    projectName1 projectName2
```

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][4] and [Pipeline Executions][5] pages populate with data after the workflows finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.
