## Compatibility

- **Custom spans**: Configure custom spans

- **Custom pre-defined tags**: Set [custom tags][6] to all generated pipeline and job spans

- **Custom tags and metrics at runtime**: Configure [custom tags][7] and metrics at runtime

## Configure the Datadog integration

The Datadog integration for [Azure Pipelines][1] works by using [service hooks][2] to send data to Datadog.

1. For each project, go to **Project settings > Service hooks** in Azure DevOps and select `Create subscription`.

2. Configure the Azure DevOps Services event.

3. Configure what to do when the event occurs:
    * **Service hook URL**: <code>https://webhook-intake.{{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}/api/v2/webhook/?dd-api-key=<API_KEY></code> where `<API_KEY>` is your [Datadog API key][3].

### Setting custom tags
To set custom tags to all the pipeline and job spans generated by the integration, add to the **Service hook URL** a URL-encoded query parameter `tags`, with `key:value` pairs separated by commas. If a key:value pair contains any commas, surround it with quotes. For example, to add `key1:value1,"key2: value with , comma",key3:value3`, the following string would need to be appended to the **Service hook URL**:

`?tags=key1%3Avalue1%2C%22key2%3A+value+with+%2C+comma%22%2Ckey3%3Avalue3`

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][4] and [Pipeline Executions][5] pages populate with data after the workflows finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.
