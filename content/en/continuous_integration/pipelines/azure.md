## Compatibility

- **Custom pre-defined tags**: Set [custom tags][6] for all generated pipeline and job spans.

## Configure the Datadog integration

The Datadog integration for [Azure Pipelines][1] works by using [service hooks][2] to send data to Datadog.

1. For each project, go to **Project settings > Service hooks** in Azure DevOps and select `Create subscription` (green plus icon).

2. Create a new subscription with the same URL for each of the following webhook types:
    - **Run state changed**
    - **Run stage state changed**
    - **Run job state changed**
    
3. Click `Next` to continue to the next step and set the following: 
    - **URL**: <code>https://webhook-intake.{{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}/api/v2/webhook/</code>
    - **HTTP Headers**: `DD-API-KEY:<API_KEY>` where `<API_KEY>` is your [Datadog API key][3].
    - **Resource Version**: Scroll down to the latest field and choose `[Latest]`.

### Setting custom tags
To set custom tags for all the pipeline and job spans generated by the integration, add to the **Service hook URL** a URL-encoded query parameter `tags`, with `key:value` pairs separated by commas. If a key:value pair contains any commas, surround it with quotes. For example, to add `key1:value1,"key2: value with , comma",key3:value3`, append the following string to the **Service hook URL**:

`?tags=key1%3Avalue1%2C%22key2%3A+value+with+%2C+comma%22%2Ckey3%3Avalue3`

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][4] and [Pipeline Executions][5] pages populate with data after the workflows finish.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.
