## Overview

You can send custom pipelines through HTTP using the [public API endpoint][1]. For more information about how pipeline executions are modeled, see [Pipeline Data Model and Execution Types][2].

### Compatibility

| Pipeline Visibility | Platform | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| [Custom tags][5] [and measures at runtime][6] | Custom tags and measures at runtime | Configure [custom tags and measures][7] at runtime. |
| [Manual steps][8] | Manual steps | View manually triggered pipelines. |
| [Parameters][9] | Parameters | Set custom parameters when a pipeline is triggered. |
| [Partial retries][10] | Partial pipelines | View partially retried pipeline executions. |
| [Pipeline failure reasons][11] | Pipeline failure reasons | Identify pipeline failure reasons from error messages. |
| [Queue time][12] | Queue time | View the amount of time pipeline jobs sit in the queue before processing. |

## Visualize pipeline data in Datadog

The [Pipelines][3] and [Pipeline Executions][4] pages populate with data after the pipelines are accepted for processing.

**Note**: The Pipelines page shows data for only the default branch of each repository.
