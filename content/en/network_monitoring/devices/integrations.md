## Overview

Network Device Monitoring (NDM) supports a growing set of integrations for routers, switches, firewalls, SD-WAN platforms, and virtual infrastructure. Use the integration icons below to explore which integrations include built-in SNMP profiles or metadata that can be collected through NDM.

## SNMP

These integrations use the **SNMP protocol** to collect metrics directly from network hardware such as routers, switches, and firewalls. NDM automatically applies the appropriate SNMP profile when it detects one of these devices.

## Software Defined Networking

The following integrations cover **software-defined and edge networking platforms** that support NDM collection. SD-WAN is a type of networking technology that uses software-defined networking (SDN) principles to manage and optimize the performance of wide area networks (WANs). They provide visibility into link health, throughput, and connectivity across distributed sites.

## Virtualization

NDM can also monitor **virtualized environments** that expose network telemetry through SNMP or API-based integrations. These integrations help you correlate host-level performance with physical network metrics.
