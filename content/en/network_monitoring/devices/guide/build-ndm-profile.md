Datadog Network Device Monitoring uses profiles for collecting metrics from network devices. These are defined narrowly by a MIB, or to collect metrics from a specific device make and model. This tutorial shows the steps for building a basic NDM profile that collects OID metrics from HP iLO4 devices.

NDM profiles use SNMP concepts. For basic details on SNMP, refer to the [terminology][1].

## Research

The first step to building an NDM profile is researching the device and determining the metrics to collect.

### Device information

Refer to the manufacturer's website or search the web to find the following information:

- Device name, manufacturer, and [system object identifier][1].

- Understand the device and its use case. Metrics vary between routers, switches, bridges, etc. For example, according to the [HP iLO Wikipedia page][2], iLO4 devices are used by system administrators for remote management of embedded servers.

- Available versions of the device, and the versions to target. For example, HP iLO devices exist in multiple versions. This tutorial is specifically targeting HP iLO4.

- Supported MIBs (ASN1, textual format), OIDs, and associated MIB files. For example, HP provides a MIB package for iLO devices [their website][3]. **Note**: The MIB is not required with the profile to collect metrics.

**Note**: For more details on device use cases, see [Networking hardware][4].

### Metrics selection

Next, decide the metrics to collect. Devices often expose thousands of metrics and OIDs that can span dozens of MIBs.

Some guidelines to help you in this process:

- Keep the number of metrics between 10 and 40.
- Explore base profiles to see which ones could be applicable to the device.
- Explore manufacturer-specific MIB files looking for metrics such as:
    - General health: status gauges
    - Network traffic: bytes in/out, errors in/out
    - CPU and memory usage
    - Temperature: temperature sensors, thermal condition
    - Power supply: on/off or total branch

## Implementation

### Add a profile

First, add a profile by creating a `.yaml` file with the `sysobjectid` and metrics, for example:

```yaml
sysobjectid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.9.4.10

metrics:
  - MIB: CPQHLTH-MIB
    symbol:
      OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.6.2.8.1.0
      name: cpqHeSysUtilLifeTime
```

**Note**: `sysobjectid` can be a wildcard pattern to match a sub-tree of devices, for example: `1.3.6.1.131.12.4.*`.

## Test the profile

Second, test the profile by targeting an IP address of a device that will use the profile.
