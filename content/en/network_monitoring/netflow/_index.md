## Overview

Use NetFlow Monitoring in Datadog to visualize and monitor your flow records from your NetFlow-enabled devices.

{{< img src="network_device_monitoring/netflow/home.png" alt="The NetFlow Monitoring page containing tabs for top sources, destinations, protocols, source ports, destination ports, and device trends" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Installation

To use NetFlow Monitoring with Network Device Monitoring, ensure you are using the [Agent][1] version 7.45 or newer.

**Note:** Configuring [metric collection from Network Device Monitoring][2] is not a requirement for sending NetFlow data, although it is strongly recommended as this extra data can be used to enrich your flow records with information such as the device name, model, and vendor, as well as the inbound/outbound interface name.

## Configuration

To configure your devices to send NetFlow, jFlow, sFlow, or IPFIX traffic to the Agent NetFlow server, your devices must be configured to send traffic to the IP address that the Datadog Agent is installed on, specifically the `flow_type` and `port`.

Edit your [`datadog.yaml`][3] Agent configuration file to enable NetFlow:

```yaml
network_devices:
  netflow:
    enabled: true
    listeners:
      - flow_type: netflow9   # choices: netflow5, netflow9, ipfix, sflow5
        port: 2055            # devices need to be configured to the same port number
      - flow_type: netflow5
        port: 2056
      - flow_type: ipfix
        port: 4739
      - flow_type: sflow5
        port: 6343
```

After saving your changes, [restart the Agent][4].

## Aggregation

The Datadog Agent automatically aggregates the data received into NetFlow to limit the number of records sent to the platform while maintaining most of the information. By default, flow recordings that have the same identifiers, such as `source`, `destination address`, `port`, and `protocol`, are aggregated together in five minute intervals. Additionally, the Datadog Agent can detect ephemeral ports and remove them. As a result, you may see Flows with `port:*`.

## Enrichment

Your NetFlow data is processed by the Datadog backend and enriched with the available metadata from your devices and interfaces. Enrichment is based on the NetFlow exporter IP and the interface indexes. To disambiguate possible collisions between reused private IPs, you can configure a different `namespace` for each Agent configuration file (with the setting `network_devices.namespace`).

If the NetFlow exporter IP is one of the device IPs, but not the one configured on the SNMP integration, Datadog attempts to locate the device that the exporter IP belongs to, and enriches your NetFlow data with it is as long as the match is unique.

### Cloud provider IP enrichment

Datadog enriches IPs with public cloud provider service and region for IPv4 addresses, so you can filter for flow records from a specific service and region.

{{< img src="network_device_monitoring/netflow/netflow_cloud_provider_ip_enrichment.png" alt="Netflow IPs enriched with cloud provider name, region, and service" width="80%" >}}

### Port enrichment

Datadog enriches ports in NetFlow with IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) data to resolve well known port mappings (such as Postgres on 5432 and HTTPS on 443). This can be seen when searching for source or destination application names on NetFlow.

{{< img src="network_device_monitoring/netflow/netflow_iana_port_mappings.png" alt="The NetFlow page filtered by @destination.application_name and displaying names for ports such as HTTPS" width="80%" >}}

#### Custom port enrichment

You can also add your own custom enrichments to map ports and protocols to specific applications (for example, if a custom service runs on a specific port). This makes it easier for network engineers and their teams to interpret and query NetFlow data with human-readable names.

From the **Configuration** tab in NetFlow, click **Add Enrichment** to upload the CSV file containing your custom enrichments.

{{< img src="network_device_monitoring/netflow/new_enrichment.png" alt="The New Enrichment Mapping modal in the Netflow configuration tab" width="80%" >}}

## Visualization

You can access the data collected by NetFlow Monitoring on the [**NetFlow** page][5]. Hover over a flow from the list for additional information about hosts, pods, and containers, and access related network connections.

{{< img src="network_device_monitoring/netflow/information.png" alt="Hover over a flow aggregated from a device emitting netflow to access related network connections" width="100%" >}}

When creating a [NetFlow monitor][6], you should consider the following fields with respect to the source IP or destination IP from the perspective of the device. These fields provide insights into network traffic patterns and help with optimizing performance and security.

By monitoring these key fields and using facets to analyze NetFlow events, organizations can gain visibility into their network infrastructure, optimize performance, and improve security posture.

This data is also available in dashboards and notebooks, enabling precise queries and correlation with other data sources. When creating a dashboard with NetFlow data, select **NetFlow** as the source in the **Graph your data** section.

## Sampling rate

NetFlow's sampling rate is taken into account in the computation of bytes and packets by default. The displayed values for bytes and packets are computed with the sampling rate applied.
Additionally, you can query for **Bytes (Adjusted) (@adjusted_bytes)** and **Packets (Adjusted) (@adjusted_packets)** in dashboards and notebooks to visualize them.

To visualize the raw bytes/packets (sampled) sent by your devices, you can query for **Bytes (Sampled) (@bytes)** and **Packets (Sampled) (@packets)** in dashboards and notebooks.

## Retention

NetFlow data is retained for 30 days by default, with options for 15, 30, 60, and 90 day retention.

## Troubleshooting

### NetFlow packet drops
NetFlow packet drops can occur when there are a high number of NetFlow packets per second, typically greater than 50,000. The following steps can help identify and mitigate NetFlow packet drops:

#### Identifying packet drops

Use the `netstat -s` command to see if there are any dropped UDP packets:

```bash
    netstat -s
  ```

#### Mitigation steps
1. Increase the Number of NetFlow Listeners

  Increase the number of NetFlow listeners by using a configuration similar to the following:
  Datadog recommends setting the number of workers to match the number of CPU cores in your system:

```yaml
      netflow:
        enabled: true
        listeners:
          - flow_type: netflow9
            port: 2055
            workers: 4 # 4 CPUs
```

2. Increase UDP Queue Length (Linux only)

  Adjusting your system's UDP queue length can help accommodate the higher volume of NetFlow packets. Increase the UDP receive buffer size to 25MB by executing the following commands:

```bash
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=26214400
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=26214400
```

3. Persisting the configuration (Linux only)

  To make these changes permanent, add the following lines to your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file:

```bash
    net.core.rmem_max=26214400
    net.core.rmem_default=26214400
```
