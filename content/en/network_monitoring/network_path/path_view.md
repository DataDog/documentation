## Overview 

The Path View section in Network Path allows for detailed examination of a particular route, assisting in resolving potential problems that might occur from the source to the destination. It offers comprehensive data on both end-to-end latency and packet loss throughout the route.

To access the path view page, click into a path from the [List view][2]. On this page, you have the ability to change the latency threshold colors, and view the status of each hop.

Click any path from the hop between the source to the destination to observe additional details such as `Hop TTL`, `Hop Latency`, and `Traversed count`. Then, click **View Device Details** to navigate to the Device details in [NDM][3] for the selected device.

## Legend

The legend provides additional details about the status of each hop.

{{< img src="network_performance_monitoring/network_path/legend.png" alt="Path view in Network path showing the legend." style="width:50%;" >}}

Traversal count 
: Number of `traceroutes` that have ran through the hop.

Traversal completion 
: Represents whether or not the `traceroute` was able to successfully reach the destination.

Reachability
: The level of packet loss the destination is experiencing.

Latency 
: How long the `traceroute` took to get from a source to its destination.

**Note**: Hop-to-hop latency may show `N/A` for hops that were incomplete.

## Health bar

Drag the latency reachability health bar to observe a snapshot of the end-to-end latency and end-to-end packet loss for a specific time interval along the path.

**Note**: Changing the health bar does not affect the global time range at the top of the page.

## Graphs

The lower section of the path view page provides additional insights about each path through a series of graphs.  

### End-to-end metrics graph

The end-to-end metrics graph presents a visual representation of both the end-to-end latency and end-to-end packet loss for each path, allowing you to compare and analyze them effectively.

### Hop-to-hop latency graph

The hop-to-hop latency graph provides a detailed view of the latency for each hop along the path, making it easier to identify potential bottlenecks or problem areas.
