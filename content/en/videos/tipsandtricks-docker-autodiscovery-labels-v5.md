summary: Orchestration platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon ECS make running containerized services easier and more resilient by handling workload scheduling and request routing. But that makes monitoring more difficult. How can you reliably monitor a service which by design constantly changes the definition normal as it moves applications between hosts? The Datadog Agent can automatically track which services are running where, thanks to its Autodiscovery feature. This video shows you how easy it is to get started with Autodiscovery on Docker with Datadog using Docker Labels.

Note: This video uses v5 of the Datadog agent. If you want to use the current agent, refer to [the updated video for Agent v6][1].
