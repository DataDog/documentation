Querying Logs and Metrics through DDSQL is in Preview. Use this form to request access.

## Overview

With [DDSQL Editor][1], you can get deeper visibility into your infrastructure by querying your resources with natural language or with [DDSQL](#use-sql-syntax-ddsql), a dialect of SQL with additional support for querying tags.

## Query in natural language

Type your question into the search box, and Datadog builds the SQL query for you. If you haven't already, [reach out to support][5] to enable this feature.

## Use SQL syntax (DDSQL)

DDSQL is a query language for Datadog data. It implements several standard SQL operations, such as `SELECT`, and allows queries against unstructured data, such as [tags][2]. Get exactly the data you want by writing your own `SELECT` statement. Query tags as if they are standard table columns. For more information, see the [DDSQL Reference][6].

{{< code-block lang="sql" >}}
SELECT instance_type, count(instance_type)
FROM aws.ec2_instance
WHERE tags->'region' = 'us-east-1' -- region is a tag, not a column
GROUP BY instance_type
{{< /code-block >}}

View, filter, and built queries in the Data Explorer.

Click a table name to view its columns and relationships:

For Logs and Metrics, use the query builder to help you generate table functions.

## Save and share queries

Save useful queries for future reference or download the data as CSV.

{{< img src="/ddsql_editor/save_export.png" alt="DDSQL Editor interface showing query results with save and export options highlighted" style="width:90%;" >}}

Export a saved query to a dashboard by clicking **Save to Dashboard**. From a dashboard you can visualize results and send Scheduled Reports.

Browse and re-run recent or saved queries in the side panel.

## Permissions

To access the DDSQL Editor app, users need the `ddsql_editor_read` permission. This permission is included in the Datadog Read Only Role by default. If your organization uses custom roles, add this permission to the appropriate role. For more information on managing permissions, see the [RBAC documentation][3].
