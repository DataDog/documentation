## Overview

Like traditional applications, an LLM application can span multiple microservices. With LLM Observability, if one of these services is an LLM proxy or gateway, you can trace LLM calls within a complete end-to-end trace, capturing the full request path across services.

## Enabling LLM Observability for a proxy or gateway service

To enable LLM Observability for a proxy or gateway service used by multiple ML applications, you can configure it without specifying an ML application name. Instead, set the service name. This allows you to [filter spans specific to that proxy or gateway service within LLM observability](#observing-llm-gateway-and-proxy-services).

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Python" %}}

```python
# proxy.py
from ddtrace.llmobs import LLMObs

LLMObs.enable(service="chat-proxy")

# proxy-specific logic, including guardrails, sensitive data scans, and the LLM call
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Node.js" %}}

```javascript
// proxy.js
const tracer = require('dd-trace').init({
  llmobs: true,
  service: "chat-proxy"
});
const llmobs = tracer.llmobs;

// proxy-specific logic, including guardrails, sensitive data scans, and the LLM call
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}


If you have a service that orchestrates ML applications which send requests to an LLM proxy or gateway, enable LLM Observability with the ML application name:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Python" %}}

```python
# application.py
from ddtrace.llmobs import LLMObs
LLMObs.enable(ml_app="my-ml-app")

import requests

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with LLMObs.workflow(name="run-chat"):
      # other application-specific logic - (such as RAG steps and parsing)

      response = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/chat", json={
        # data to pass to the proxy service
      })


      # other application-specific logic handling the response
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Node.js" %}}

```javascript
// application.js
const tracer = require('dd-trace').init({
  llmobs: {
    mlApp: 'my-ml-app'
  }
});
const llmobs = tracer.llmobs;

const axios = require('axios');

async function main () {
  llmobs.trace({ name: 'run-chat', kind: 'workflow' }, async () => {
    // other application-specific logic - (such as RAG steps and parsing)

    // wrap the proxy call in a task span
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:8080/chat', {
      // data to pass to the proxy service
    });

    // other application-specific logic handling the response
  });
}

main();
```

When the LLM application makes a request to the proxy or gateway service, the LLM Observability SDK automatically propagates the ML application name from the original LLM application. The propagated ML application name takes precedence over the ML application name specified in the proxy or gateway service.

## Observing LLM gateway and proxy services

### All requests to the proxy or gateway service

To view all requests to the proxy service as top-level spans, wrap the entrypoint of the proxy service endpoint in a `workflow` span:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Python" %}}

```python
# proxy.py
from ddtrace.llmobs import LLMObs

LLMObs.enable(service="chat-proxy")

@app.route('/chat')
def chat():
    with LLMObs.workflow(name="chat-proxy-entrypoint"):
        # proxy-specific logic, including guardrails, sensitive data scans, and the LLM call
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Node.js" %}}

```javascript
// proxy.js
const tracer = require('dd-trace').init({
  llmobs: true,
  service: "chat-proxy"
});
const llmobs = tracer.llmobs;

app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
  await llmobs.trace({ name: 'chat-proxy-entrypoint', kind: 'workflow' }, async () => {
    // proxy-specific logic, including guardrails, sensitive data scans, and the LLM call
    res.send("Hello, world!");
  });
});
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

All requests to the proxy service can now be viewed as top-level spans within the LLM trace view:

1. In the [LLM trace][1] page, select **All Applications** from the top-left dropdown.
2. Switch to the **All Spans** view in the top-right dropdown.
3. Filter the list by the `service` tag and the workflow name.

{{< img src="llm_observability/all-spans-with-service-and-span-name.png" alt="View all spans from all ML applications with the service and workflow name tags" style="width:100%;" >}}

You can also filter the workflow **Span Name** using the facet on the left hand side of the trace view:

{{< img src="llm_observability/span-name-facet-for-proxy-service-monitoring.png" alt="Select the workflow span name from the facet on the left hand side of the trace view" style="width:50%;" >}}

### All LLM calls made within the proxy or gateway service

To only monitor the LLM calls made within a proxy or gateway service, filter by `llm` spans in the trace view:

{{< img src="llm_observability/all-spans-with-service-and-span-kind.png" alt="View all spans from all ML applications with the service tags and the LLM span kind" style="width:100%;" >}}

You can also filter the **Span Kind** facet on the left hand side of the trace view:

{{< img src="llm_observability/span-kind-facet-for-proxy-service-monitoring.png" alt="Select the LLM span kind facet from the left hand side of the trace view" style="width:50%;" >}}

### Filtering by a specific ML application and observing patterns and trends

You can apply both filtering processes ([top-level calls to the proxy service](#all-requests-to-the-proxy-or-gateway-service) and [LLM calls made within the proxy or gateway service](#all-llm-calls-made-within-the-proxy-or-gateway-service)) to a specific ML application to view its interaction with the proxy or gateway service.

1. In the top-left dropdown, select the ML application of interest.
2. To see all traces for the ML application, switch from the **All Spans** view to the **Traces** view in the top-right dropdown.
3. To see a timeseries of traces for the ML application, switch back to the **All Spans** filter in the top-right dropdown and next to "Visualize as", select **Timeseries**.

{{< img src="llm_observability/timeseries-view-for-proxy-services.png" alt="Switch from a List view to a Timeseries view in the Traces view while maintaining the All Span filter" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Observing end-to-end usage of LLM applications making calls to a proxy or gateway service

To observe the complete end-to-end usage of an LLM application that makes calls to a proxy or gateway service, you can filter for traces with that ML application name:

1. In the LLM trace view, select the ML application name of interest from the top-left dropdown.
2. Switch to the `Traces` view in the top-right dropdown.
