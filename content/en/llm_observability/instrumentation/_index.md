To start sending data to LLM Observability, instrument your application automatically with the [LLM Observability Python or Node.js SDKs][1] or by using the [LLM Observability API][2].

You can visualize the interactions and performance data of your LLM applications on the [**LLM Observability Traces** page][3], where each request fulfilled by your application is represented as a trace.
