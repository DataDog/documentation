  OpenTelemetry instrumentation for LLM Observability is in Preview. For access, <a href="/help">contact Datadog Support</a>.
{{< /callout >}}

## Overview
By using OpenTelemetry's standardized semantic conventions for generative AI operations, you can instrument your LLM applications with any OpenTelemetry-compatible library or framework and visualize the traces in LLM Observability.

LLM Observability supports ingesting OpenTelemetry traces that follow the [OpenTelemetry 1.37 semantic conventions for generative AI][1]. This allows you to send LLM traces directly from OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications to Datadog without requiring the Datadog LLM Observability SDK or a Datadog Agent.

## Prerequisites

- A [Datadog API key][2]
- An application instrumented with OpenTelemetry that emits traces following the [OpenTelemetry 1.37 semantic conventions for generative AI][1]
- Access to the OpenTelemetry instrumentation beta feature ([contact support][4] to request access)

## Setup

To send OpenTelemetry traces to LLM Observability, configure your OpenTelemetry exporter with the following settings:

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables in your application:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT={{< region-param key="otlp_trace_endpoint" code="true" >}}
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS=dd-api-key=<YOUR_API_KEY>,dd-otlp-source=datadog
```

Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your [Datadog API key][2].

**Note**: If you are using an OpenTelemetry library other than the default OpenTelemetry SDK, you may need to configure the endpoint, protocol, and headers differently depending on the library's API. Refer to your library's documentation for the appropriate configuration method.

### Instrumentation

To generate traces compatible with LLM Observability, do one of the following:

- Use an OpenTelemetry library or instrumentation package that emits spans following the [OpenTelemetry 1.37 semantic conventions for generative AI][1].
- Create custom OpenTelemetry instrumentation that produces spans with the required `gen_ai.*` attributes, as defined in the semantic conventions.

After your application starts sending data, the traces automatically appear in the [**LLM Observability Traces** page][3]. To search for your traces in the UI, use the `ml_app` attribute, which is automatically set to the value of your OpenTelemetry root span's `service` attribute.

**Note**: There may be a 3-5 minute delay between sending traces and seeing them appear on the LLM Observability Traces page.

## Supported semantic conventions

LLM Observability supports spans that follow the OpenTelemetry 1.37 semantic conventions for generative AI, including:

- LLM operations with `gen_ai.provider.name`, `"gen_ai.operation.name"`, `gen_ai.request.model`, and other gen_ai attributes
- I/O on direct attributes or through events
- Token usage metrics (`gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`)
- Model parameters and metadata

For the complete list of supported attributes and their specifications, see the [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for generative AI documentation][1].
