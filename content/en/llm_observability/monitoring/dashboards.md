## Overview

Datadog provides four out-of-the-box dashboards for LLM Observability that automatically populate when you instrument your LLM applications. These dashboards help you monitor operational health, analyze chain execution, evaluate quality and safety, and get a comprehensive overview of your LLM applications.

The four out-of-the-box dashboards are:

- [LLM Observability Operational Insights](#llm-observability-operational-insights): High-level operational metrics and performance tracking
- [LLM Observability LLM Chain Insights](#llm-observability-llm-chain-insights): Detailed span-level analysis of chains and workflows
- [LLM Observability Evaluation Insights](#llm-observability-evaluation-insights): Quality, safety, and custom evaluation monitoring
- [LLM Observability Overview](#llm-observability-overview): Comprehensive single-pane view of costs, performance, and safety

<div class="alert alert-info">If you see empty dashboards, start by instrumenting your LLM application with the <a href="/llm_observability/instrumentation/sdk/">Datadog SDK</a> or <a href="/llm_observability/instrumentation/api/">API</a>.</div>
