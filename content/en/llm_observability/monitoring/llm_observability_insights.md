## Overview

LLM Observability Insights provides a powerful monitoring experience that helps users identify anomalies in their operational metricsâ€”such as latency (duration), error rates, and out-of-the-box (OOTB) evaluation results.

Outlier detection is performed across key dimensions, including:
- Span name
- Workflow type
- Cluster input/output topics

These outliers are analyzed over the past week and automatically surfaced in the corresponding time window selected by the user. This enables teams to proactively detect regressions, performance drifts, or unexpected behavior in their LLM pipelines.
