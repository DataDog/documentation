## Overview

LLM Observability allows you to monitor, troubleshoot, and improve your agentic applications. With the LLM Observability SDK for Python, you can monitor the health and quality of your single- or multi-agentic systems built on [OpenAI Agents SDK][1], [LangGraph][2], or [CrewAI][3].

For your agentic applications, LLM Observability allows you to:

- Monitor error rate, latency build up, or cost 
- Visualize agent decisions, such as tools used or agent a task was handed off to
- Trace and troubleshoot end-to-end requests of agent executions
