## Service Level Objectives

[Service Level Objectives][1] (or SLOs) are a key part of the site reliability engineering toolkit. SLOs provide a 
framework for defining clear targets around application performance, which ultimately help teams provide a consistent 
customer experience, balance feature development with platform stability, and improve communication with internal and 
external users. 

For more information on creating SLOs, see the [Configuring Service Level Objectives info][2].
