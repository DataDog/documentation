## Overview
This section details Datadogs HTTP API. It makes it easy to get data in and out of Datadog.

The Datadog API uses resource-oriented URLs, uses status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests and returns JSON from all requests. Let's dive in and see how it works.

**Note**: cURL code examples assume usage of BASH and GNU coreutils. On macOS you can install coreutils via the [Homebrew package manager][1]: `brew install coreutils`
