## Logs Pipelines

<mark>The Logs Pipelines endpoints are not supported in Datadog's client libraries. To request this functionality, contact [Datadog Support][1]. To set your pipeline permissions see the [Granting permissions within limited scopes][2] documentation.</mark>

Pipelines and processors operate on incoming logs, parsing and transforming them into structured attributes for easier querying.

* See the [Pipelines Configuration Page][3] for a list of the pipelines and processors currently configured in our UI.
* For more information about Pipelines, see the [Pipeline documentation][4].

**Note**: These endpoints are only available for admin users. Make sure to use an application key created by an admin.
