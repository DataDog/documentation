## Overview

Datadog Network Performance Monitoring (NPM) is designed to give you visibility into your network traffic across any tagged object in Datadog: from containers to hosts, services, and availability zones. Connection data is aggregated into flows, each showing traffic between one _source_ and one _destination_, through a customizable [network page][1] and [network map][2].
Each flow contains network metrics such as throughput, bandwidth, retransmit count, and source/destination information down to the IP, port, and PID levels.
