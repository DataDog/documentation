## Overview

Datadog Network Device Monitoring is designed to give you visibility into your network-connected devices, such as routers, switches, servers, and firewalls using SNMP protocol.

Configure the Datadog Agent to automatically discover devices on any network and collect metrics such as bandwidth utilization, throughput, and up/down of devices. Graph the metrics on a Datadog [dashboard][1], or create a [monitor][2] to be alerted when issues arise.
