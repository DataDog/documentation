Static Analysis is a clear-box software testing technique that analyzes a program's pre-production code without the need to execute the program, meaning that the program is static because it isn't running. Static Analysis helps you identify maintainability issues and security vulnerabilities early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure only the highest quality, most secure code makes it to production. Static Analysis tools that scan for security vulnerabilities are also commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools.

Using Static Analysis provides organizations with the following benefits:

* Static Analysis takes the guesswork out of adhering to an organization's code standards, enabling your development team to ship compliant code without significant impacts to developer velocity.
* An organization's applications are less vulnerable to security breaches over time, due to new vulnerabilities being caught through SAST scans before code reaches production.
* New developers to an organization are able to onboard faster because Static Analysis enables an organization to maintain a more readable codebase over time.
* An organization's software becomes reliable over time by virtue of the code being more maintainable because the risk of a developer introducing new defects to the code is minimized.

## Setup

To use Datadog Static Analysis, add a `static-analysis.datadog.yml` file to your repository's root directory to specify which rulesets to use.

For example, for Python rules:

```yaml
rulesets:
  - python-best-practices
  - python-security
  - python-code-style
  - python-inclusive
ignore-paths:
  - "path/to/ignore"
  - "**.js"
```

A `static-analysis.datadog.yml` file supports the following:

| Name               | Description                                                                               | Required | Default |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `rulesets`         | A list of ruleset names. [View all available rulesets][6].                                | `true`   |         |
| `ignore-paths`     | A list of relative paths to ignore. It supports using globbing patterns.                  | `false`  |         |
| `ignore-gitignore` | Determines whether Datadog Static Analysis analyzes the content in a `.gitignore` file.   | `false`  | `false` |

Configure your [Datadog API and application keys][4] and run Static Analysis in the respective CI provider.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "CircleCI Orbs" %}}

To run Static Analysis with CircleCI, [follow these instructions for setting up a CircleCI Orb][101].

[101]: /static_analysis/circleci_orbs

### Upload third-party static analysis results to Datadog

<div class="alert alert-info">
  SARIF importing has been tested for Snyk, CodeQL, Semgrep, Checkov, Gitleaks, and Sysdig. Please reach out to <a href="/help">Datadog Support</a> if you experience any issues with other SARIF-compliant tools.
</div>

You can send results from third-party static analysis tools to Datadog, provided they are in the interoperable [Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) Format][5]. 

To upload a SARIF report:

1. Ensure the [`DD_API_KEY` and `DD_APP_KEY` variables are defined][4].
2. Optional: Set a [`DD_SITE` variable][103] (default: `datadoghq.com`).
3. Install the `datadog-ci` utility:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g @datadog/datadog-ci
   ```

4. Run the third-party static analysis tool on your code and output the results in the SARIF format.
5. Upload the results to Datadog:

   ```bash
   datadog-ci sarif upload $OUTPUT_LOCATION --service <datadog-service> --env <datadog-env>
   ```

## Run Static Analysis in a CI pipeline

Datadog Static Analysis runs in your CI pipelines using the [`datadog-ci` CLI][2] and checks your code against Datadog's default rulesets.

### Search and filter results

After you configure your CI pipelines to run the Datadog Static Analyzer, violations appear on the [Static Analysis Results page][1]. To filter your results, use the facets to the left of the list, or search. 

Each violation is associated with a specific commit and branch from your repository on which the CI pipeline ran. The rows represent every violation per commit. 

Click on a violation to open a side panel that contains information about the scope of the violation and where it originated.
{{< img src="ci/static-analysis-violation.png" alt="Side panel for a static analysis violation" style="width:80%;">}} 

The content of the violation is shown in tabs:

* Source Code: A description of the violation and the lines of code that caused it. To see the offending code snippet, configure the [Datadog GitHub App][3].
* Fixes: One or more code fixes that can resolve the violation, which you can copy and paste.
* Event: JSON metadata regarding the Static Analysis violation event.

### Using suggested fixes
{{< img src="ci/static-analysis-fixes.png" alt="Fixes tab of a static analysis violation" style="width:80%;">}}

In Datadog Static Analysis, there are two types of suggested fixes:

1. **Default Suggested Fix:** For simple violations like linting issues, the rule analyzer automatically provides templated fixes.
2. **AI Suggested Fix:** For complex violations, fixes are typically not available beforehand. Instead, you can use AI Suggested Fixes, which use OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate a suggested fix. You can choose between "Text" and "Unified Diff" fixes, which outputs plain text instructions or a code change for resolving the violation, respectively.

The two types of fixes are distinguished visually in the UI with different labels.

*Default Suggested Fixes:*
{{< img src="ci/static-analysis-default-fix.png" alt="Visual indicator of a default static analysis suggested fix" style="width:60%;">}}

*AI Suggested Fixes:*
{{< img src="ci/static-analysis-ai-fix.png" alt="Visual indicator of an AI static analysis suggested fix" style="width:60%;">}}

### Ignoring violations
You can ignore a specific instance of a violation by commenting `no-dd-sa` above the line of code to ignore. This prevents that line from ever producing a violation. For example, in the following Python code snippet, the line `foo = 1` would be ignored by Static Analysis scans.

```python
#no-dd-sa
foo = 1
bar = 2
```
