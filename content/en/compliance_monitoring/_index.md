## Overview

Datadog Compliance Monitoring enables runtime security and continuous compliance monitoring for containers and hosts.

Use **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** to watch for changes to key files and directories on hosts or containers in real time or
**Continuous Compliance** checks against your containers, and Kubernetes clusters in order to find configuration issues, as defined in the popular CIS compliance benchmarks for Docker and Kubernetes. You can choose to enable either of these features (or both) based on your needs.
