## Assigning owners

In API Catalog, you manage ownership at the API level, where each API represents a group of endpoints. The owners of APIs are called *teams*.

You can find the teams that own an API on the API page, endpoint side panel, and in the **Explorer** table. Teams are represented by a pill containing a name like `Orders`. Click the team name to see additional details like the team members, contact links, and more. Team details are useful to resolve incidents related to specific endpoints.

To assign owners from the Datadog UI:

1. Make sure the [API endpoints are registered][1].
2. From the **API** column, click the API you want to assign an owner to.
3. Beside the **N/A** pill at the top-left, click the pencil icon.
4. Select a team from the list.
5. Click **Confirm**.

To assign owners within the API specification file:

1. Add the team name to the `x-datadog.teamHandle` property:
   {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=6-7" >}}
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
 title: API Name
 description: API Description
 version: 1.0.0
x-datadog:
 teamHandle: <dd-team>
{{< /highlight >}}
2. [Import the OpenAPI/Swagger file][2].
