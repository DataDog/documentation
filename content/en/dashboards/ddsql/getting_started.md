- To run a natural language query, type your question into the search bar, or click on one of the provided examples below the search bar.
- To run a SQL query, type a valid DDSQL expression into the top section of the page, or run one of the examples listed under **Queries to get you started**.

## Example querying flow

This example flow showcases the key features of DDSQL. If the provided query isn't suitable for your data, you can use your own query instead.

- Run a query from the documentation
- Modify the query with natural language
- Modify the query with the schema explorer
- Share the query
- Save the query
- View the query in recent queries
