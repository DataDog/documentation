## Overview

Dashboards provide visibility into your data across Datadog products. Add details and configurations to expedite troubleshooting and add focus to the information you are visualizing.

Configure individual dashboards to:
- [Add details and descriptive information on what the dashboard visualizes](#dashboard-details)
- [View configuration actions to customize your dashboard display and view dashboard related activities](#configuration-actions)
- [Restrict access to individual dashboards with Permissions](#permissions)
- [Customize views with template variables](#template-variables)

## Dashboard details

From an individual dashboard, hover over the dashboard title to view and edit dashboard details. A panel opens which displays the title and the creator.

Update Markdown-supported dashboard descriptions or associate [teams][1] with a dashboard:

1. Hover the dashboard title. A dropdown panel opens.
1. Click on the dashboard title or description to edit them. 
1. Click the check button, to change the title.
1. Select up to 5 teams from the **Teams** dropdown.
1. (Optional) Add `[[suggested_dashboards]]` inside the dashboard description for a list of suggested dashboards. These dashboards are recommended based on the user activity in your organization and how often users go from this dashboard to other dashboards.

## Template variables

 Template variables allow you to focus your dashboards on a particular subset of hosts, containers, or services based on tags or facets. See the [Template variables][2] documentation to learn how to:
 - Add and configure dashboard template variables
 - Apply template variables to dashboard widgets
 - Use template variables to create Saved views

## Configuration actions

Click **Configure** to open a menu of configuration options available for your dashboard, including:

| Configuration    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Version history | Preview, restore, or clone your dashboard's version history. For more information, see the [Version History guide][3]. |
| View audit events | See who is using this dashboard within your organization. As an individual, you can see a stream of your own actions. For more information, see [Datadog Audit Trail][4]. |
| Clone dashboard | Copy the entire dashboard to a new dashboard. You are prompted to name the clone. |
| Keyboard&nbsp;shortcuts | View a list of available keyboard shortcuts. |
| Display UTC time | Toggle between UTC time and your default time zone. |
| Increase density | High-density mode displays group widgets in a dashboard side-by-side for increased widget density. This mode turns on by default on large screens for dashboards that use group widgets. |
| TV Mode | Toggle to display key performance metrics on large screens or TVs. |

### Notifications

Enable notifications tracking to receive change notifications for a dashboard. Any user in the organization can enable this for themselves, regardless of administrative privileges.

When notifications are activated for a dashboard, an event is created in the [Events Explorer][5]. This event provides information on text changes, widget changes, dashboard cloning, and dashboard deletion, along with the name of the user performing the action. View change events for a specific dashboard in the event explorer by searching:

```text
tags:(audit AND dash) <DASHBOARD_NAME>
```

### Copy, import, or export dashboard JSON

Copy, import, or export a dashboard's JSON using the export icon (upper right) with the following options:

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Copy&nbsp;dashboard&nbsp;JSON   | Copy the dashboard's JSON to your clipboard.                                                                                                                               |
| Import&nbsp;dashboard&nbsp;JSON | Paste or import your JSON to the dashboard. This option overwrites all content on the dashboard. If the JSON is already on your clipboard, use `Ctrl V` (`Cmd V` for Mac). |
| Export&nbsp;dashboard&nbsp;JSON | Download a JSON file containing the JSON of your dashboard.                                                                                                                |

### Delete dashboard

<div class="alert alert-warning">Dashboards must be unstarred before deletion.</div>

Use this option to permanently delete your dashboard. You are prompted to confirm deletion.

## Permissions

<div class="alert alert-info"><em>View</em> restrictions on individual dashboards are available to anyone on an <strong>Enterprise</strong> tier plan. Reach out to your account team or <a href="/help/">Datadog support</a> to enable this feature. </div>

{{< img src="dashboards/access_popup.png" alt="Dialog box with dropdown menu allowing users to choose a role to access the dashboard." style="width:70%;">}}

Use granular access controls to limit the [roles][6] that may edit a particular dashboard:
1. While viewing a dashboard, click on the cog **Configure** in the upper right.
1. Select **Permissions**.
1. Click **Restrict Access**.
1. The dialog box updates to show that members of your organization have **Viewer** access by default.
1. Use the dropdown to select one or more roles, teams, or users that may edit the dashboard.
1. Click **Add**.
1. The dialog box updates to show that the role you selected has the **Editor** permission.
1. Click **Save**.

**Note:** To maintain your edit access to the dashboard, the system requires you to include at least one role that you are a member of before saving. For more information about roles, see the [RBAC documentation][6].

To restore general access to a dashboard with restricted access, follow the steps below:
1. While viewing a dashboard, click on the cog **Configure** in the upper right.
1. Select **Permissions**.
1. Click **Restore Full Access**.
1. Click **Save**.

If the dashboard was created with the deprecated "read only" setting, the access control list pre-populates with a list of roles that have the Access Management (`user_access_manage`) permission.

If you manage your dashboards with Terraform, you can use the latest version of the Datadog Terraform provider to control which roles can edit your dashboards. For more information, see the [Terraform Dashboard role restriction guide][7].

The access indicator appears at the top right of each edit-restricted dashboard. Depending on your permissions, it may say **Gain Edit Access** or **Request Edit Access**. Click the access indicator to understand your access permissions and what steps to take to edit the dashboard.
