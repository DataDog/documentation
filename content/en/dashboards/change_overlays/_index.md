## Overview

As teams iterate, deploy code, and continually make changes to their applications and services, it can be difficult to find the exact change that caused a spike in errors, an increase in latency, or slower page load times. Use Change overlays to identify when a recent change is causing performance issues within your application or services and find the source of the problem.

View the moment a change occurs in the context of your Datadog observability data to pinpoint issues to specific releases, correlate changes with metrics, and troubleshoot faster. Change overlays supports [APM service deployments][1].

## Overlay changes on graphs

To get started, click **Show Overlays** in the upper right corner of your dashboard.

Overlays automatically appear on timeseries graphs filtered with the `service` tag for services configured with `version` tags. To enable deployments in your APM services, [add version tags to your configuration][1]. 

Click on any event overlay to open a side panel with more information and [analyze the impact of your change](#analyze-the-impact-of-your-change).

### Show faulty deploys
Use the toggle in the overlays panel to only show [faulty deployments][2] that could be impacting your metrics.

### Override automatic detection
Override the automatic service detection by using the search bar to find the service of interest. 

## Analyze the impact of your change
Click on any overlay on your graph to open a change analysis page, allowing you to understand the status and impact of you change.

### APM deployments
For APM deployments, you can:
- Compare the version selected to overall service performance for requests, errors, or latency
- View the rollout of your version by `region`, `env`, or `datacenter`
- See new Error Tracking issues that have been introduced with the new deployment
- Check related infrastructure that your service is running on

## FAQ
### When do overlays appear?
For APM deployments, overlays appear on timeseries graphs that:
1. Are filtered by the `service` tag in the query
2. Have the `service` set up with the `version` tag

### What are deployments scoped to?
For APM deployments, an `env` must be specified. If you have an `env` or `datacenter` template variable set in your dashboard, deployments are filtered to match the selection. Otherwise, the `env` defaults to `prod`.
