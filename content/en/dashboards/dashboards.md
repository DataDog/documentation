Dashboards are on a next-gen grid based layout which can include a variety of objects such as images, graphs, and logs. They are commonly used as status boards or storytelling views that update in real-time or represent fixed points in the past. They also work well for debugging.

To switch from the [Timeboard layout][1] to the Dashboard layout, use `Pick Layout` in the cog menu and select `Grid`.

#### High-density mode

High-density mode displays group widgets in a dashboard side-by-side for increased widget density. This mode turns on by default for on large screens for dashboards that use group widgets.
