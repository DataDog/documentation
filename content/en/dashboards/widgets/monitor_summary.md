The monitor summary widget displays a summary view of all your Datadog monitors, or a subset based on a query.

## Setup

{{< img src="dashboards/widgets/monitor_summary/monitor-summary-setup.png" alt="monitor summary setup"  style="width:80%;">}}

### Configuration

1. Select one of the three summary types: `Monitor`, `Group` or `Combined`
    - The `Monitor` summary type lists statuses and names of monitors matching the [monitor query][1]. Multi-alert monitors have only one row in the results list and their status is the multi-alert monitor’s overall status. The Status Counts are the number of matching monitors with each status type.

    - The `Group` summary type lists statuses, names, and groups of monitors matching the monitor query. Multi-alert monitors are broken into several rows in the results list and correspond to each group and that group’s specific status in the multi-alert monitor. The `Group` summary type also supports `group` and `group_status` facets in its monitor query similar to the [Triggered Monitors page][2]. The Status Counts are the number of matching monitor groups with each status type.

    - The `Combined` summary type lists the number of group statuses and names of the monitors matching the monitor query. Multi-alert monitors have only one row in the results list like in the `Monitor` summary type but the groups column displays the number of groups in each status type instead of the monitor’s overall status. Similar to the `Group` summary type, the `Combined` summary type also supports the `group` and `group_status` facets in its monitor query. The Status Counts still show the count of overall monitor statuses like in the `Monitor` summary type.

2. Enter a monitor query to display the monitor summary widget over a subset of your monitors.
    - If you have template variables created in your dashboard and wish to include them in your monitor query, type the dollar sign `$` in the search bar followed by the name of the template variable. When `$` is typed in the search bar, an autocomplete list of the template variables available in your current dashboard appears for you to select your desired template variable.

    **Note** In addition to the facets listed in the link above, the `Group` and `Combined` summary types also support the `group` and `group_status` facets for group-level searching, similar to the [Triggered Monitors page][2].

## Options

#### Display preferences

Choose to show only the `Count` of monitors per monitor status type, a `List` of monitors, or `Both`. The `Text` and `Background` options specify whether the status colors should be applied to the text or background of the Status Counts. The `Hide empty Status Counts` option, when enabled, only shows the Status Counts for statuses that have more than zero monitors in the result list.

Selecting the `Show triggered column` option filters the results to monitors or monitor groups that are in a triggered state (`Alert`, `Warn`, or `No Data`) and sorts them from most recently triggered to least recently triggered. An additional column is added indicating the amount of time that has elapsed since the monitor/group last triggered.

#### Title

Display a custom title for your widget by checking the `Show a title` check box:

You can optionally define the title’s size and alignment.
