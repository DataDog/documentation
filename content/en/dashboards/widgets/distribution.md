The Distribution visualization shows data aggregated across one or several tags, such as *hosts*. Unlike the [heatmap][1], a distribution graph's x-axis is quantity rather than time.

This visualization displays only a single query; additional queries are disregarded.

**Note**: Outlier detection cannot be performed for this visualization.

## Setup

### Configuration

1. Choose the data to graph.The Distribution visualization supports metrics, live processes, APM request latency, log events, and RUM events. 
**Note**: This visualization type is useful only when data is aggregated across tag keys, such as for each `host`.
1. Make a selection in the "`avg`/`max`/`min`/`sum by`/etc." control to see your data across the associated tags.
1. Customize your graph with the available options.

### Options

#### Percentile markers

With APM request distributions, you can add percentiles markers on the x-axis.

#### X-axis and Y-axis controls

Axis controls are available through the UI and the JSON editor. 

They allow you to:

* Clip the x and y-axes to specific ranges.
* Automatically change x-axis bounds based on a percentage or an absolute value threshold. This threshold can be applied to one or both ends of the graph (lower and upper) in order to remove "outlier" bins.
* Change the y-axis scale from linear to log.

### Full screen

In addition to the [standard full screen options][2], you can use x-axis controls to zoom in to a specific percentile.

## API

This widget can be used with the **Dashboards API**. See the [Dashboards API documentation][3] for additional reference.
