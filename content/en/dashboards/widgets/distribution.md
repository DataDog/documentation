The Distribution visualization shows data aggregated across one or several tags, such as *hosts*. Unlike the [heat map][1], a distribution graph's x-axis is quantity rather than time.

This visualization displays only a single query; additional queries are disregarded.

**Note**: Outlier detection cannot be performed for this visualization.

## Setup

{{< img src="dashboards/widgets/distribution/distribution_setup.png" alt="Distribution graph editor view"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Configuration

Configure your query as usual. The Distribution visualization supports metrics, live processes, APM request latency, log events, and RUM events. Note that this visualization type is useful only when data is aggregated across tag keys, e.g. for each `host`.
Make a selection in the "`avg`/`max`/`min`/`sum by`/etc." control to see your data across the associated tags.

### Options

#### Display preference

##### Global time

On screenboards only, choose whether your widget has a custom timeframe or the screenboard's global timeframe.

#### Markers

With APM request distributions, you can add percentiles markers on the x-axis.

#### X-axis and Y-axis controls

Axis controls are available via the UI and the JSON editor. They allow you to:

* Clip the x and y-axes to specific ranges.
* Automatically change x-axis bounds based on a percentage or an absolute value threshold. This threshold can be applied to one or both ends of the graph (lower and upper) in order to remove "outlier" bins.
* Change the y-axis scale from linear to log.

#### Title

Display a custom title for your widget by activating the `Show a Title` check box:

{{< img src="dashboards/widgets/options/title.png" alt="Widget title"  style="width:80%;">}}

Optionally define its size and alignment.

## Full screen

In addition to the [standard full screen options][2], you can use x-axis controls to zoom in to a specific percentile.
