The notes and links widget is similar to [free text widget][1], but allows for more formatting options.

## Setup

{{< img src="dashboards/widgets/note/using_link_note_widget.mp4" alt="Notes and links widget setup" video="true" style="width:80%;" >}}

1. Enter the text you want to display. Note that Markdown is supported.
2. Choose the text size and the note background color.
3. Select the pointer position.

This widget supports template variables. Use `$<VARIABLE_NAME>.value` syntax to dynamically update the widget content. For example, `$env.value` updates the value of a link to the selected environment.
