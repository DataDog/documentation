## Setup

### Configuration

1. Select a previously created service check.
2. Choose a reporting time frame. This time frame always includes up to the present, so you can choose an option such as `The past 10 minutes` or `The past 1 day` and it reports a status that includes that time frame up to the present moment. If you choose `Global Time`, the person using the dashboard can select a range using the time frame selector in the upper right, but _they must choose one that includes the present moment_, that is any `past X` time frame. Otherwise the widget will be blank.
3. Choose your scope:
    * **A single check**: Select this option if your Check Status widget is for a specific element only, for example: one `host:<HOSTNAME>`, one `service:<SERVICE_NAME>`, etc.
    * **A cluster of checks**: Select this option if your Check Status widget is for a scope of elements i.e all `host`s, all `service`s, etc.

4. After selecting your scope, define your Check Status widget context with the **Reported by** field.
5. Optional: group your checks result according to a custom tag key.

### Options

#### Title

Display a custom title for your widget by activating the `Show a Title` check box:
