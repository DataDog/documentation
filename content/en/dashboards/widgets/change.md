The Change graph shows you the change in a metric over a period of time. It compares the absolute or relative (%) change in value between N minutes ago and now against a given threshold. The compared datapoints aren't single points but are computed using the parameters in the define the metric section. For more information, see the [Metric Monitor][6] documentation, and the [Change Alert Monitors guide][7].

## Setup

### Configuration

1. Choose a metric to graph.
2. Choose an aggregation function.
3. Optional: choose a specific context for your widget.
4. Break down your aggregation by a tag key such as `host` or `service`.
5. Choose a value for the "Compare to" period:
    * an hour before
    * a day before
    * a week before
    * a month before
6. Choose between `relative` or `absolute` change.
7. Select the field by which the metrics are ordered:
    * `change`
    * `name`
    * `present value`
    * `past value`
8. Choose `ascending` or `descending` ordering.
9. Choose whether to display the current value in the graph.

### Options
