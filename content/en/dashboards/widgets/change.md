### Configuration

1. Choose a metric to graph.
2. Choose an aggregation function.
3. Optional: choose a specific context for your widget.
4. Break down your aggregation on a tag key i.e `host`, `service`...
5. Choose the "Compared" period from:
    * an hour before
    * a day before
    * a week before
    * a month before
6. Select to show the `relative` or `absolute` change between the two periods.
7. Select your ranking by sorting your result by:
    * `change`
    * `name`
    * `present value`
    * `past value`
8. Indicate whether `increases` or `decreases` changes is better. The better one is highlighted in green; the other one in red.
9. Optional: display current value.
