The network widget supplements the [Network Performance Monitoring][1] feature by allowing you to create timeseries of network data, including volume and TCP retransmit counts of traffic between services, hosts, containers, and any other Datadog tag. Timeseries created with this widget can be placed in dashboards alongside visualizations of logs, traces, and processes data.

**Note**: This widget only supports timeseries visualizations.

## Setup

1. Select "Network Traffic" from the dropdown menu. By default, this is set to "Metric".

    You can also filter down to a specific service, host, etc., by adding tags to the source and destination search bars.
