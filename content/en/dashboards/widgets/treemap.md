The treemap widget allows you to display proportions of one or more datasets. This widget can display a single dataset with corresponding proportions, or multiple datasets with nested proportions.

{{< img src="dashboards/widgets/treemap/treemap_overview.png" alt="A treemap widget with unique page views stemming from the Real User Monitoring (RUM) dataset are shown at both the country and browser level. The outer groups - distinguished by color - shows the user's country.">}}

## Configuration

1. Select from the available data sources. 
2. Configure the query, see the following resources for more information:
    * Metrics: See the [querying ][1] documentation to configure a metric query.
    * Events: See the [log search][2] documentation to configure a log event query.
3. (Optional) Modify query with a [formula][3].
4. Customize your graph.

## Customization

### Context links

[Context links][4] are enabled by default, and can be toggled on or off. Context links bridge dashboard widgets with other pages (in Datadog, or third-party).

## Display and interaction

### Filter and focus

In the case where multiple groups of data are plotted at once, you can filter the widget to a single category and view proportions within it.

To filter and focus on a single category, hover over the outer portion of the category, and click. To go back to the previous view, click the **back** button on the top left header of the widget.

### Accessing the context menu

To access the context menu, first hover over an individual category: this can be a nested category, or group - such as **Canada**, or **Canada > Edge** in the following example. This reveals a dropdown button in the top right corner. When clicked, the context menu appears.

### Full-screen

Viewing the treemap widget in full-screen reveals the standard set of [full-screen options][5].

## Pie chart widget

Like the treemap widget, the [pie chart widget][8] can also be used to display nested proportions. The primary difference between the two is that the pie chart displays proportions in radial slices, and the treemap displays nested rectangles.

## API

This widget can be used with the **[Dashboards API][6]**. See the following table for the [widget JSON schema definition][7]:
