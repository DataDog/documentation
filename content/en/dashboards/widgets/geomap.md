The geomap widget visualizes geographic data with shaded regions or points. It can be used to:
- View user sessions by country.
- Filter to see a list of all sessions in a new tab.
- View user sessions filtered by employee.
- Monitor performance metrics like load time, core web vitals, and percent of views with errors.
