The heat map visualization shows metrics aggregated across many tags, such as *hosts*. The more hosts that have a particular value, the darker that square is.

This visualization displays only a single metric query; additional queries are disregarded.

**Note**: Outlier detection cannot be performed for this visualization.

## Setup

{{< img src="dashboards/widgets/heat_map/heat_map_setup.png" alt="Heat Map setup"  style="width:80%;">}}

### Configuration

Configure your metric query as usual. Note that this visualization type is useful only when metrics are aggregated across tag keys , e.g. for each `host`.

Make a selection in the "`avg`/`max`/`min`/`sum by`/etc." control to see your data across the associated tags.

### Options

#### Event overlay

Add events from related systems to add more context to your graph. For example, you can add GitHub commits, Jenkins deploys, or Docker creation events. Expand the **Event Overlays** section and enter a query to display those events. Use the same query format as for the [Event Stream][1], for example:

| Query                       | Description                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sources:jenkins`           | Shows all events from the Jenkins source.                  |
| `tag:role:web`              | Shows all events with the tag `role:web`.                  |
| `tags:$<TEMPLATE_VARIABLE>` | Shows all events from the selected [Template Variable][2]. |

#### Y-axis controls

Y-axis controls are available via the UI and the JSON editor. They allow you to:

* Clip the y-axis to specific ranges.
* Automatically change y-axis bounds based on a percentage or an absolute value threshold. This threshold can be applied to one of both ends of the graph (lower and upper) in order to remove "outliers" series.
* Change the y-axis scale from linear to log, pow, or sqrt.

Change the Y-axis scale by expanding the *Y-Axis Controls* button.

The following configuration options are available:

| Option                | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Min`/`Max`           | No       | Specify the minimum and / or maximum value to show on y-axis. It takes a number or `Auto` as the default value.                                                                                                   |
| `Scale`               | No       | Specifies the scale type. Possible values:<br>- *linear*: A linear scale (default)<br>- *log*: A logarithmic scale<br>- *pow*: A Power of 2 scale (2 is default, modify in JSON)<br>- *sqrt*: A square root scale |
| `Always include zero` | No       | Always include zero or fit the axis to the data range. The default is to always include zero.                                                                                                                     |

**Note**: Because the mathematical log function doesn't accept negative values, the Datadog log scale only works if values are of the same sign (everything > 0 or everything < 0). Otherwise an empty graph is returned.

## API
