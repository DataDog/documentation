SLOs (service-level objectives) are an agreed-upon target that must be achieved for each activity, function, and process to provide the best opportunity for customer success. SLOs represent the performance or health of a service.

The SLO List widget displays a subset of SLOs over their primary time window. All other configured time windows are available in the SLO's side panel on the SLO page. For more information, see the [SLO][1] documentation.

2. Use tags to filter the list of SLOs (such as `service:foo, env:prod`). Template variables are supported. 
3. Choose the maximum number of SLOs to display (the default is 100) and sort by either status or error budget.
4. Optionally, give the widget a title.

When you are ready to create the widget, click **Save**.
