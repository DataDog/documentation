Retention Analysis allows you to measure how often users are successfully returning to a page or performing an action. By tracking user retention over time, you can gain insights into overall user satisfaction. Use Retention Analysis to answer questions like the following:
- After visiting the checkout page and purchasing one item, what percentage of people come back and continue to do that in the following weeks?
- During the holiday season, how many people look at the catalog page once and never return?
- On a ride share app, how many people open up the app and then order a ride?

## Setup

To populate User Retention data, you must set the `usr.id` attribute in your SDK. [See the instructions for sending unique user attributes][1].

### Configuration

1. Define the initial event by selecting **View** or **Action** and choose a query from the dropdown menu.
1. (Optional) Click **+ Add different return step** to configure a different return event from the original event. 
1. Define users by selecting from users or segments in the dropdown.
1. Customize the chart to display either as a percentage or total number, and to measure by days, weeks, or months. 

### Options

#### Global time

On screenboards and notebooks, choose whether your widget has a custom timeframe or uses the global timeframe.
