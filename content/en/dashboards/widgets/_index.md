## Overview

Dashboard widgets are visual representations of data.  They serve as the building blocks for your dashboards to visualize and correlate your data across your infrastructure. They can contain different types of information, such as graphs, images, logs, and statuses, to give you an overview of your systems and environments.

## Get started

The fastest way to onboard widgets relevant to your data is to clone a dashboard from the [preset list][1] which includes dashboards created by other members of your organization and out-of-the-box templates for your installed integrations. After you clone a dashboard, you can customize widgets to your use case.

### Add a widget to your dashboard

To begin using widgets in your dashboards:

1. Navigate to the [Dashboards page][2] in Datadog.
2. Click **New Dashboard** or select an existing dashboard to edit.
3. Click **Add Widget**. Choose from a variety of widget types such as timeseries, bar chart, table, or event stream.
4. Configure your widget:
    - Select data source: Choose metrics, logs, traces, or other data sources.
    - Customize visualization: Adjust display settings, units, and timeframes to fit your needs.
    - Add context: Use custom links, conditional formatting, and grouping for enhanced insights.
5. Save your dashboard and share it with your team or externally as needed.

For more information, see [Widget Configuration][3] and explore the available [Widget Types][4].

## Data sources

Widgets can visualize data from multiple Datadog sources including:

- **APM Traces**: Application performance monitoring data
- **Events**: Custom events, deployments, and annotations
- **Logs**: Log events, log analytics, and log-based metrics
- **Metrics**: Infrastructure, application, and custom metrics
- **RUM**: Real User Monitoring and synthetic test data
- **SLOs**: Service Level Objectives and error budgets
- **Security**: Security signals and compliance data

## Common use cases
