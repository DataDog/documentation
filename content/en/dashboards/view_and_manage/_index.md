## Overview

## Dashboards List


## View dashboards on mobile devices

The [Datadog Mobile App][1], available on the [Apple App Store][2] and [Google Play Store][3], enables you to view your dashboards in a mobile-friendly format. 

The Mobile App comes equipped with mobile home screen widgets which allow you to monitor service health and infrastructure without opening the mobile app.
