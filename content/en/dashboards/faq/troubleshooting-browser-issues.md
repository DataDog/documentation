If you're seeing unexpected results in the Datadog app such as missing data or blank graphs/widgets, try the following checklist to troubleshoot the issue:

* Check if you have the same issue using incognito mode/private browsing
* Open your browser console to see whether there are any errors in the Network tab
* Check if you have the same issue using a different browser
* Ask teammates to check their accounts from their machines and confirm whether they can reproduce the issue
* Log in to your account from a different machine to see whether the issue persists
* Check that your system clock is not [significantly offset from NTP][1]
* Are you experiencing this from multiple locations? Can you send the output of:
    * traceroute app.datadoghq.com
    * tracepath app.datadoghq.com
* Is this dashboard specific? Using the Chrome browser, do the following:
    * Select View->Developer->Developer Tools
    * Click on the Network tab of the new window that opens
    * Load the dashboard experiencing issues
    * After the page has loaded, right click on the results that show up and * select "Save as HAR with content"
    * Save the file as an attachment and send to us

In most of the scenarios above, the root cause of the issue is related to a browser extension, outdated browser, or something similar.

For further assistance, contact [Datadog support][2]. To expedite your request include:

* Results of the above tests
* A screenshot of your issue
* A link to the page in question
* Extensions you're running
* Browser version
* OS versions
