Within Datadog, a graph can only contain a set number of points and, as the timeframe over which a metric is viewed increases, aggregation between points occurs so that the number of points remains under that set number. Thus, granularity is lost as the timeframe increases. For instance, for a four hour time window, data is aggregated to have one value per minute for a line graph, and one value per two minutes for a bar graph. As you "zoom out" (i.e. select a larger timeframe) the data shown on the graph represents a longer time period.

When bars are displayed the rollup interval is more obvious:

You can manually append the `.rollup()` function to your query to adjust the method and granularity of time aggregation. Datadog rolls up data points automatically by default, averaging values in the rollup interval for `GAUGE`, `RATE` and `COUNT` metric types.

**Note**: If you query your metrics through the UI of a Datadog widget, an [in-application metric types modifier][1] is added automatically to your `RATE` and `COUNT` metric types. This changes the `.rollup()` behaviour: values are summed without any interpolation.
