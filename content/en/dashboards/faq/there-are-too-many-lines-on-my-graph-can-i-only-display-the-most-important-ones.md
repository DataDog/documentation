## Problem

When using a grouped query there are sometimes too many lines displayed on the graph, and you might end up with something complicated to read, for example:

{{< img src="dashboards/faq/too_many_metrics_1.png" alt="too_many_metrics_1" >}}

... where you only need to focus on the hosts with high load values here.

## Solution

The top function is a good fit to display only the few relevant lines on the graph:

{{< img src="dashboards/faq/too_many_metrics_2.png" alt="too_many_metrics_2" >}}

See the [Top function documentation][1] for more details.
