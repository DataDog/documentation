## Graphing

If you stop reporting data to Datadog, after a certain period of time metrics, tags, and hosts no longer appear in the Datadog UI:

| Item                                 | Age Out  |
|--------------------------------------|----------|
| Hosts                                | 2 hours  |
| Metrics                              | 24 hours |
| Tags in template variable drop-downs | 30 days  |
| Tags in other drop-downs             | 12 hours |
| APM `env` tags                       | 60 days  |

Even though the data is not listed, you can still query the data with the [JSON editor][1]. A simple solution is to query for the host name or tags:

{{< img src="dashboards/faq/query_post_deletion.png" alt="Querying with JSON Editor" style="width:90%;" >}}

If you're planning to frequently churn hosts, add a tag to the [Agent][2] in `datadog.yaml` or use the [Infrastructure list][3] (user tags).

## Deleting

### Metrics and tags

There is no way to delete a metric or tag immediately. The list above shows how long a metric or tag stays in the UI if it is no longer reporting.

For monitors, the metric stream is no longer considered after the age-out period.

For dashboards, the metric or tag appears in the visualization following the age-out period but is not available in the drop-downs for graphing with the UI editor. The corresponding metric or tag remains available for graphing by using the [JSON][1] method.

### Hosts

If you're running the Agent, and you've intentionally [stopped][4] or [removed][5] your host, all hosts that have not seen new data in 2 hours disappear from the UI. You can still query against them. However, they do not appear in drop-downs, the infrastructure list, or host map.
