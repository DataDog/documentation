## Overview

On **December 13, 2024**, Datadog is removing support for the `is_read_only` attribute in the Dashboards API's. For customers who manage Dashboards with the API directly, Datadog recommends that you transition to [`restricted_roles`](#migrate-to-restricted_roles) or [Restriction Policies](#restriction-policies). 

## Actions to take before December 13, 2024

Before December 13, 2024, migrate off of `is_read_only` to `restricted_roles` or consider participating in Preview for Restriction Policies.

### Migrate to `restricted_roles`

The `restricted_roles` parameter allows Dashboard owners to assign specific permissions to users with roles.

Migrating to `restricted_roles` can be done independently. For more information, see the [Dashboard API][1] documentation.

### Restriction Policies

Restriction Policies for Dashboards defines the access control rules for a resource. It maps a set of relations (editor and viewer) to a set of allowed principals (roles, teams, or users). 

To participate in the beta for Restriction Policies, reach out to Datadog Support or your Customer Success Manager to enable Restriction Policies for Dashboards for your organization. 

If you're managing Dashboards through Terraform: 
1. Ensure that you're using Datadog Terraform Provider v3.27.0 or higher.
2. Remove `is_read_only` and `restricted_role` from your Dashboard Terraform resources. 
3. Create a new [datadog_restriction_policy][2] resource, referencing the respective Dashboard id and principals from the recently removed attributes. 
4. Run `terraform apply`.

For an example of a Terraform resources, see the guide on [How to use Terraform to restrict the editing of a dashboard][3].
