## Overview

You can use Quick Graphs to graph your data from anywhere in Datadog. 

Open the Quick Graphs editor with any of the following:

* Pressing `G` on any page.
* The global search (`Cmd+K` on MacOS, `Ctrl+K` on Windows) menu.
* The dashboards submenu.

## Graph your data

### Graphing metrics

To query metrics, follow this process outlined in [Dashboard Querying][1]:
1. [Choose the metric to graph][1].
2. [Filter][2].
3. [Aggregate and rollup][3].
4. [Apply additional functions][4].

### Graphing events
This section provides a brief overview of querying event platform data sources such as [Logs][5], [APM][6], [RUM][7], [Security][8], [Events][9], [CI Pipelines][10], [CI Tests][11], and [Findings][12]. Choose the event data source using the dropdown which is defaulted to **Metrics**. 

To query event data, follow this process:
1. **Filter:** Narrow down, broaden, or shift your focus on the subset of data of current interest. The top field allows you to input a search query mixing key:value and full-text search.

2. **Choose the measure or facet:** Measure lets you choose the aggregation function whereas facet displays the unique count.

3. **Aggregate:** If you are graphing a measure, select the aggregation function for the measure you want to graph and use a facet to split your graph.

4. **Rollup:** Choose the time interval for your graph. Changing the global timeframe changes the list of available timestep values.

5. **[Apply additional functions][4]** (same as metrics).

## Select a visualization

Quick Graphs supports:
* [Timeseries][13]
* [Top List][14]
* [Query value][15]
* [Geomap][16]

## Give your graph title

If you do not enter a title, one is automatically generated based on your selections. However, it is recommended that you create a title that describes the purpose of the graph.

## Export & share

Click **Export** to save your work to a Dashboard or Notebook. You can always come back to the editor to change the graph. If want to share a link directly to your graph without a Dashboard or Notebook, click **Copy to Clipboard**.
