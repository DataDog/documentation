## Overview

Whether they are part of your [runbooks][1], attached to a [monitor notification][2] or simply a [screenboard][3] you always keep an eye on, 
you likely consider some of your Dashboards as a homebase for troubleshooting.

Dashboards are designed to perform first assessment across multiple datasources that your consider relevant for a specific context.

However some investigations require a deeper dive into specialised pages in the Datadog application, 
where built-in features would make a difference to spot the root cause of a problem or the core answer to a specific question.

It's as well possible that the next action to take in your workflow is somewhere in a third-party application.


Dashboards widgets comes with interactive related links. For [generic widgets][4], those links are customisable
for you to point towards external applications, or override default behaviour to fine-tune the context of the landing page.

In this guide, you'll learn:
* The basics of the feature: how to configure which links appear, create new links and override existing ones
* Examples for creating external links
* Examples for overriding native links


## Basics of the Feature


## Creating links to third-part applications

### Linking to your AWS Console

### Linking to your Customer Profile page in your CRM


## Overriding native links

### Jump to the log explorer in the context of a specific saved view

### Reinterprete a value from another context 

(reinterpret the client.ip of a http call - in RUM - as the source.ip of a network flow)
