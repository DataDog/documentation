## Overview

For compatible series of data, Datadog can map colors to meaning. When a compatible tag is detected, Datadog suggests the Semantic color palette. This automatically maps data to meaning-driven colors.

**Note**: To use the Semantic color palette, a query must be grouped with a single set of tags.

### Map compatible tags to colors based on their meaning

For example, an error status code is mapped to red, and success to green.

### Ensure consistent coloring across charts

Charts with a semantic palette use the same, stable color for each tag. This allows you to easily trace a given tag across different graphs.

### Grouping behavior

Queries grouped with a single set of tags are supported. If multiple groupers are used with the semantic palette, coloring is consistent, but not meaning-driven.

For example, consider a query that uses both the `Status` and `Service` tags. Even if the semantic palette is selected, the colors in the chart no longer correspond to a specific meaning (as in, red no longer necessarily indicates "bad"). However, each status/service combination retains consistent coloring for all charts.
