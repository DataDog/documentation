DDSQL is in private beta.

*Value expressions* are the general expression language used to produce values for conditions, `SELECT` expressions, filters, and clauses like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`. The expression syntax of DDSQL is a superset of SQL expression syntax.

## Arithmetic operators

DDSQL supports standard binary and unary infix arithmetic notation from SQL and many other languages:

| Operator | Description              | Example | Result |
|----------|--------------------------|---------|--------|
| +        | addition                 | 2 + 3   | 5      |
| -        | subtraction              | 2 - 3   | -1     |
| *        | multiplication           | 2 * 3   | 6      |
| /        | division (non-truncating) | 5 / 2   | 2.5    |


The standard order of operations applies. To control the order of operations, add parentheses: `(5 - 2) * 3`.

## Comparison operators

DDSQL implements the following comparison operators:

| Operator | Description            | Example | Result |
|----------|------------------------|---------|--------|
| >        | greater than           | 2 > 3   | false  |
| <        | less than              | 2 < 3   | true   |
| >=       | greater than or equals | 3 >= 2  | true   |
| <=       | less than or equals    | 3 <= 2  | false  |
| =        | equals*                | 3 = 3   | true   |
| !=, <>   | not equals             | 3 != 3  | false  |

For tag references and tag groups, the equality operator (`=`) is treated as a "contains" comparison. See the [Querying Tags in DDSQL][1] for more details.

Additionally, DDSQL supports the following SQL keywords, which function as standard boolean operators:

- `NOT`
- `AND`
- `OR`

DDSQL also supports the following comparator keywords as they are defined in the SQL standard:

- `IS NULL`
- `IS NOT NULL`
- `LIKE`
- `NOT LIKE`
- `IN`
- `NOT IN`

DDSQL supports the `BETWEEN` keyword such that `a BETWEEN x AND y` is equivalent to `a >= x AND a <= y`. See [the Postgres documentation for `BETWEEN`][2] for details.

## Logical operators

| Name    | Description             |
|---------|-------------------------|
| AND     | Boolean logic, a & b    |
| OR      | Boolean logic, a &vert;&vert; b |
| XOR     | Boolean logic, a ^ b    |
| NOT     | Boolean logic, !a       |
| IS NULL | Returns true for each row that is null |


## CASE

The `CASE` expression is a generic conditional expression, similar to if/else statements in other programming languages. `CASE` comes in two forms, simple and searched.

### Simple CASE statements

Simple CASE statements use the following syntax:

{{< code-block lang="sql" >}}
CASE expression
  WHEN value THEN result
  [ WHEN ... ]
  [ ELSE result ]
END
{{< /code-block >}}

The expression is computed, then compared to each of the value expressions in the `WHEN` clauses until one is found that is equal to it. If no match is found, the result of the `ELSE` clause, or `NULL` if `ELSE` is omitted, is returned.

### Searched CASE statements

Searched CASE statements use the following syntax:

{{< code-block lang="sql" >}}
CASE
  WHEN condition THEN result
  [ WHEN ... ]
  [ ELSE result ]
END
{{< /code-block >}}

If a condition's result is true, the value of the `CASE` expression is the result that follows the condition, and the remainder of the `CASE` expression is not processed. If the condition's result is not true, any subsequent `WHEN` clauses are examined in the same manner. If no `WHEN` condition yields true, the value of the `CASE` expression is the result of the `ELSE` clause. If the `ELSE` clause is omitted and no condition is true, the result is `NULL`.

## CAST

`CAST` specifies a conversion from one data type to another.

### Syntax

{{< code-block lang="sql" >}}
CAST(expression AS type)
{{< /code-block >}}

Not all types are convertible in this way.

DDSQL also supports Postgres casting syntax:

{{< code-block lang="sql" >}}
expression::type
{{< /code-block >}}

For example, `SELECT 1::text;`.
