DDSQL Editor is in private beta.
{{< /callout >}}

## Overview

With [DDSQL Editor][1], you can get deeper visibility into your infrastructure by querying your resources with natural language or with [DDSQL][2], a dialect of SQL with additional support for querying tags.

### Query in natural language

Type your question into the search box, and Datadog builds the SQL query for you.

### Use SQL syntax (DDSQL)

Get exactly the data you want by writing your own `SELECT` statement. Query tags as if they are standard table columns. For more information on DDSQL queries, see the [DDSQL Reference][2] documentation.

{{< code-block lang="sql" >}}
SELECT instance_type, count(instance_type)
FROM aws_ec2_instance
WHERE env = 'staging' -- env is a tag, not a column
GROUP BY instance_type
{{< /code-block >}}

### Explore your infrastructure data

View and filter the list of tables and fields in the schema side panel:

Click a table name to view its columns and relationships:

### Save and share queries

Save useful queries, or export the data as CSV.

Browse and re-run saved queries in the side panel.
