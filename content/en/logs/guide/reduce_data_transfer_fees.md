## Overview

As your organization grows, the amount of data you transfer between cloud providers to Datadog can also increase. Cloud providers charge a *data transfer* fee or *data egress* fee to move that data from cloud storage over public IP addresses. This can easily become one of the largest line items in your organization’s cloud cost bill. 

Send data over a private network to avoid the public internet and reduce your data transfer fees. As an example of how private links reduce your costs, in the US East AWS Regions, it costs $0.09 to transfer 1GB, but with AWS PrivateLink, the cost to transfer data goes down to $0.01 per GB.

## Additional tools 

After you switch to private links, you can use the following to monitor your usage and have more control over your data costs:
- Datadog's [Network Performance Monitoring][1] identifies your organization’s highest throughput applications.
- [Cloud Cost Management][2] tools can verify and monitor the reduction in your cloud costs.
