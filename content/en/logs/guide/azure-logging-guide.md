## Overview

Use this guide to set up logging from your Azure subscriptions to Datadog.

Datadog recommends sending logs from Azure to Datadog with the Agent or DaemonSet. For some resources it may not be possible. In these cases, you can create a log forwarding pipeline using an Azure Event Hub to collect [Azure Platform Logs][2]. For resources that cannot stream Azure Platform Logs to an Event Hub, you can use the Blob Storage forwarding option. To collect logs from Azure Log Analytics workspaces, you must use the Azure Event Hub process.

**All sites**: All Datadog sites can use the steps on this page to send Azure logs to Datadog.

**US3**: If your organization is on the Datadog US3 site, you can use the Azure Native integration to simplify configuration for your Azure log forwarding. Datadog recommends using this method when possible. Configuration is done through the [Datadog resource in Azure][5]. This replaces the Azure Event Hub process for log forwarding. See the [Azure Native Logging Guide][4] for more information.

{{% tab "Automated Installation" %}}

To get started, click the button below and fill in the form on Azure Portal. The Azure resources required to get activity logs streaming into your Datadog account will be deployed for you.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDataDog%2Fdatadog-serverless-functions%2Fmaster%2Fazure%2Fdeploy-to-azure%2Fparent_template.json)

Alternatively, Datadog provides automated scripts you can use for sending Azure activity logs and Azure platform logs (including resource logs).

### Azure activity logs

Follow these steps to run the script that creates and configures the Azure resources required to stream activity logs into your Datadog account. These resources include activity log diagnostic settings, Azure Functions, Event Hub namespaces, and Event Hubs.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Cloud Shell**.

{{< img src="integrations/azure/azure_cloud_shell.png" alt="azure cloud shell" popup="true" style="width:100%">}}

2. Run the command below to download the automation script into your Cloud Shell environment. 

{{< code-block lang="powershell" filename="Activity Logs Step 1" >}}

(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/master/azure/eventhub_log_forwarder/activity_logs_deploy.ps1", "activity_logs_deploy.ps1")

{{< /code-block >}}

You can also [view the contents of the script](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/blob/master/azure/eventhub_log_forwarder/activity_logs_deploy.ps1).

3. Invoke the script by running the command below, while replacing **`<API_KEY>`**, with your [Datadog API token](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys), and **`<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`**, with your Azure Subscription ID. Add [Optional Parameters](#optional-parameters) to configure your deployment.

{{< code-block lang="powershell" filename="Activity Logs Step 2" >}}

./activity_logs_deploy.ps1 -ApiKey <API_KEY> -SubscriptionId <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> 

{{< /code-block >}}

### Azure platform logs

To send Azure platform logs (including resource logs), you can deploy an Event Hub and log forwarder function pair. 
After deploying, create diagnostic settings for each of the log sources to stream logs to Datadog.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Cloud Shell**.

2. Run the Powershell command below to download the automation script into your Cloud Shell environment. 

   {{< code-block lang="powershell" filename="Platform Logs Step 1" >}}

   (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/master/azure/eventhub_log_forwarder/resource_deploy.ps1", "resource_deploy.ps1")

   {{< /code-block >}}

   You can also [view the contents of the script](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-serverless-functions/blob/master/azure/eventhub_log_forwarder/resource_deploy.ps1).

3. Invoke the script by running the Powershell command below, replacing **`<API_KEY>`**, with your [Datadog API token](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys), and **`<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`**, with your Azure Subscription ID. You can also add other optional parameters to configure your deployment. See [Optional Parameters](#optional-parameters).

   {{< code-block lang="powershell" filename="Platform Logs Step 2" >}}

   ./resource_deploy.ps1 -ApiKey <API_KEY> -SubscriptionId <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> 

   {{< /code-block >}}

4. Create diagnostic settings for all Azure resources sending logs to Datadog. Configure these diagnostic settings to stream to the Event Hub you just created.

All of the Azure resources deployed for the Platform Logs pipeline contain its ResourceGroup-Location appended to its default name. For example, `datadog-eventhub-westus`. However, you can alter this convention by overriding the parameter.

**Note**: Resources can only stream to Event Hubs in the same Azure region, so you need to replicate step 2 for each region you want to stream resource logs from.

### Set up both activity and resource logs

To stream both activity logs and resource logs, run the first script including the optional parameter `-ResourceGroupLocation <REGION>`. Activity logs are a subscription-level source, so you can create your pipeline for them in any region. Once this is deployed, send resource logs through the same Event Hub by adding diagnostic settings on your resources in `westus`.

**Note**: This integration does not collect events.

### Optional parameters

**Note**: Ensure that your custom resource names are unique when you customize the following parameters. Validate that the resource name does not already exist within your list of other Azure resources.

## Log Archiving

Archiving logs to Azure Blob Storage requires an App Registration even if you are using the Azure Native integration. To archive logs to Azure Blob Storage, follow the setup instructions to configure the integration using an App Registration. App Registrations created for archiving purposes do not need the `Monitoring Reader` role assigned.

Once you have an App Registration configured, you can [create a log archive][3] that writes to Azure Blob Storage. 

**Note**: If your storage bucket is in a subscription being monitored through the Azure Native integration, a warning is displayed in the Azure Integration Tile about the App Registration being redundant. You can ignore this warning.
