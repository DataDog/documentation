## Overview

Monitor the usage of Flex compute through various graphs on the Flex Controls page. Make informed decisions using data on cost-performance tradeoffs and balance operational success with financial efficiency.

## Monitoring query performance

Flex compute is limited by two factors:
- The number of concurrent queries
- The maximum number of logs that can be scanned per query

Query slowdowns occur when the concurrent query limit is reached, and a query is retrying to find an available slot to run in. If an available slot is not found, the query will not run. Datadog displays an error message advising you to retry your query at a later time.

### Available metrics

The Flex Logs Controls page provides visualizations so you can assess how often query slowdowns are occurring and where they are happening most frequently. The following metrics are available:
- Query slowdowns
- Top sources of query slowdowns
- Top users experiencing slowdowns
- Top dashboards experiencing slowdowns

## Optimization recommendations

Use this information to optimize your usage.

1. **Reach out to outlier users to:**
   - Discuss their querying needs
   - Understand if there are logs they query frequently that should be stored in Standard Indexing instead
1. **Improve dashboards experiencing slowdowns by:**
   - Pausing the auto-refresh of dashboards

   - Evaluating if logs used to power widgets can be converted into metrics to reduce the heavy Flex compute usage. For example, if dashboard widgets are only looking at a number of "error" or "success" instances, but the logs themselves contain very low information density, consider turning these logs into a metric.
   - Organizing dashboard widgets into groups, and keep the group collapsed until needed. Widgets in a collapsed group do not load when the dashboard is opened
1. **Consider upgrading your Flex compute size** to increase the concurrent query limit if you notice sustained query slowdowns.
1. **Scope to the index** you are querying. If the logs you are querying belong to a specific index, scoping to that index can speed up your search.

To learn more about compute sizes, see the [Flex Logs][1] documentation.
