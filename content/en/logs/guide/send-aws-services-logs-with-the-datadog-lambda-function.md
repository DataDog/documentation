AWS service logs can be collected with the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function. This Lambda—which triggers on S3 Buckets, CloudWatch log groups, and CloudWatch events—forwards logs to Datadog.

To start collecting logs from your AWS services:

1. Set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][1] in your AWS account.
2. [Enable logging](#enable-logging-for-your-aws-service) for your AWS service (most AWS services can log to a S3 bucket or CloudWatch Log Group).
3. [Set up the triggers](#set-up-triggers) that cause the Forwarder Lambda to execute when there are new logs to be forwarded. There are two ways to configure the triggers.

**Note**: If you are in AWS us-east-1 region, leverage [Datadog-AWS Private Link][2].

**Note**: Cloudformation creates an IAM policy which includes KMS:Decrypt for all resources. It is known that this does not align with Security hub best practice. The reason this permission is used is to decrypt objects from KMS encrypted S3 buckets to set up Lambda function, and which KMS key is used to encrypt the S3 buckets cannot be predicted. You can safely delete this permission after the installation successfully finished.

## Set up triggers

There are two options when configuring triggers on the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function:

- [Automatically](#automatically-set-up-triggers): Datadog automatically retrieves the log locations for the selected AWS services and adds them as triggers on the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function. Datadog also keeps the list up to date.
- [Manually](#manually-set-up-triggers): Set up each trigger yourself.

### Automatically set up triggers

Datadog can automatically configure triggers on the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function to collect AWS logs from the following sources and locations:

| Source                          | Location       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| S3 Access Logs                  | S3             |
| Classic ELB Access Logs         | S3             |
| Application ELB Access Logs     | S3             |
| CloudFront Access Logs          | S3             |
| Redshift Logs                   | S3             |
| Lambda Logs                     | CloudWatch     |

1. If you haven't already, set up the [Datadog log collection AWS Lambda function][1].
2. Ensure the policy of the IAM role used for [Datadog-AWS integration][3] has the following permissions. Information on how these permissions are used can be found in the descriptions below:

3. Navigate to the _Collect Logs_ tab in the [AWS Integration tile][4].
4. Select the AWS Account from where you want to collect logs, and enter the ARN of the Lambda created in the previous section.
   {{< img src="logs/aws/AWSLogStep1.png" alt="Enter Lambda" popup="true" style="width:80%;" >}}
5. Select the services from which you'd like to collect logs and hit save. To stop collecting logs from a particular service, uncheck it.
   {{< img src="logs/aws/AWSLogStep2.png" alt="Select services" popup="true" style="width:80%;" >}}
6. If you have logs across multiple regions, you must create additional Lambda functions in those regions and enter them in this tile.
7. To stop collecting all AWS logs, press the _x_ next to each Lambda ARN. All triggers for that function are removed.
8. Within a few minutes of this initial setup, your AWS Logs appear in your Datadog [log explorer page][5] in near real time.

### Manually set up triggers

#### Collecting logs from CloudWatch log group

If you are collecting logs from a CloudWatch log group, configure the trigger to the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][1] using one of the following methods:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "AWS console" %}}



1. Select the corresponding CloudWatch Log Group, add the trigger, and optionally add a filter name.
2. Once done, go into your [Datadog Log section][1] to start exploring your logs.

[1]: https://app.datadoghq.com/logs
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Terraform" %}}

For Terraform users, you can provision and manage your triggers using the [aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter][1] resource. See sample code below.

```conf
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter" "datadog_log_subscription_filter" {
  name            = "datadog_log_subscription_filter"
  log_group_name  = <CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME> # e.g., /aws/lambda/my_lambda_name
  destination_arn = <DATADOG_FORWARDER_ARN> # e.g., arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123:function:datadog-forwarder
  filter_pattern  = ""
}
```

[1]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "CloudFormation" %}}

For AWS CloudFormation users, you can provision and manage your triggers using the CloudFormation [AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter][1] resource. See sample code below.

The sample code also work for AWS [SAM][2] and [Serverless Framework][3]. For Serverless Framework, put the code under the [resources][4] section within your `serverless.yml`.

```yaml
Resources:
  MyLogSubscriptionFilter:
    Type: "AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter"
    Properties:
      DestinationArn: "<DATADOG_FORWARDER_ARN>"
      LogGroupName: "<CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME>"
      FilterPattern: ""
```

[3]: https://www.serverless.com/
[4]: https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/resources/
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### Collecting logs from S3 buckets

If you are collecting logs from an S3 bucket, configure the trigger to the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][1] using one of the following methods:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "AWS Console" %}}

1. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket that contains your logs in the AWS console:
  {{< img src="logs/aws/adding_trigger.png" alt="Adding trigger" popup="true"style="width:80%;">}}

2. Select the bucket and then follow the AWS instructions:
  {{< img src="logs/aws/integration_lambda.png" alt="Integration Lambda" popup="true" style="width:80%;">}}

3. Set the correct event type on S3 buckets:
  {{< img src="logs/aws/object_created.png" alt="Object Created" popup="true" style="width:80%;">}}

Once done, go into your [Datadog Log section][1] to start exploring your logs!

[1]: https://app.datadoghq.com/logs
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Terraform" %}}

For Terraform users, you can provision and manage your triggers using the [aws_s3_bucket_notification][1] resource. See the sample code below.

```conf
resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "my_bucket_notification" {
  bucket = my_bucket
  lambda_function {
    lambda_function_arn = "<DATADOG_FORWARDER_ARN>"
    events              = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
    filter_prefix       = "AWSLogs/"
    filter_suffix       = ".log"
  }
}
```


[1]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_notification
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "CloudFormation" %}}

For CloudFormation users, you can configure triggers using the CloudFormation [NotificationConfiguration][1] for your S3 bucket. See the sample code below.

```yaml
Resources:
  Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: "<MY_BUCKET>"
      NotificationConfiguration:
        LambdaConfigurations:
        - Event: 's3:ObjectCreated:*'
          Function: "<DATADOG_FORWARDER_ARN>"
```

## Scrubbing and filtering

You can scrub emails or IP address from logs sent by the Lambda function, or define a custom scrubbing rule [in the Lambda parameters][42].
You can also exclude or send only those logs that match a specific pattern by using the [filtering option][43].
