Get notified at any moment if the volumes in any scope (`service`, `availibility-zone`, etc...) of your infrastructure are growing unexpectedly:

1. Go to the [Datadog Log Explorer][1] view
2. Build a [search query][2] that represents the volume to monitor.
3. Click on **Export to monitor**.
4. Define the rate you would like to set as *warning* or *error*.
5. Define an explicit notification: `The volume on this service just got too high. Define an additional exclusion filter or increase the sampling rate to get it back under control.`
