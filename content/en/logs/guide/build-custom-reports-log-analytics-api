## Overview

Somtimes you might want to build custom reports and dashboards for your teams. These reports may contain metrics based on log events as well as other business data.

To build such custom reports, you can use the Log Analytics API in Datadog.

The following examples are covered in this guide:

* [Getting count](#getting-count)
* [Getting stats](#getting-stats)
* [Getting percentiles](#getting-percentiles)

## Prerequisites

Since this guide describes usage of the API, you will need an API key and an application key from an admin user. These are available in your [Datadog account API key page][2].

Throughout this article, you will need to replace all occurrences of `<DATADOG_API_KEY>` and `<DATADOG_APP_KEY>` with your Datadog API key and your Datadog application key, respectively.

This guide also assumes that you have a terminal with `CURL`.
