Because your logs may contain sensitive data, you should be extra careful in how you handle them. Once you realize that you are ingesting sensitive data into Datadog, consider these two things:

- If you have intentionally set up your logs to have sensitive data for legitimate troubleshooting and auditing purposes, use Roles Based Access Control to ensure that you have set up appropriate restrictions to ensure that only entitled users who have access to your Datadog account can access this data. For more information, see the [Logs Roles Based Access Control (RBAC) User's Guide][1] and learn how to configure it for your organization.
- Address any unintentional logging of sensitive data to preemptively address any concerns down the road. Continue with this guide to learn about addressing that concern.

Controlling all of the data flow at any time can be challenging, especially on a large and highly collaborative platform. This guide walks you through the three steps you should take when you detect compliance-sensitive data from your platform:

1. [Determine the scope of the data being sent](#determine-the-scope-of-the-data-being-sent) the nature and the scope of sensitive data being sent.
2. [Fix the source of the data upstream](#fix-the-source-of-the-data-upstream) the source of data upstream.
3. [Handle data already sent to Datadog](#handle-data-already-sent-to-datadog) sensitive data that has already been sent into Datadog.


## Determine the scope of the data being sent

### What log query defines sensitive data?

First, define a query that outlines the sensitive data. That query would return all logs with sensitive data and, ideally, only such logs. 

Chances are that queries such as `version:x.y.z source:python status:debug` match that expectation. Refer to the [Log Search Syntax][2] documentation if you need more advanced operators (wildcards, boolean operators, etc.) to get there.

This guide refers to that query as the **sensitive outline query**. Keep track of this query for the next steps.

### Where is the sensitive data inside Datadog?

Once sensitive data is sent to your Datadog platform, it may exist in a number of places. As a result, be sure to check each of the following (ordered from most likely to have sensitive data to least likely):

* Datadog [Indexes][3] are where logs are stored with Datadog until they age out according to index retention. Although there could be sensitive data coming in at multiple places in Datadog, focus on Datadog Indexes because other locations are likely a lesser compliance concern. Check [indexes filters][4] and [exclusion filters][5] to see if logs with sensitive data are indexed.

* Check your Log [Archives][6], which is where Datadog sends logs to be stored on your end. Set up Archive Filters to see if your archive contains sensitive logs.

* Datadog [Metrics generated from Logs][7] storing aggregated metrics, meaning sensitive data likely have been discarded or crushed. Check custom metrics filters to see if logs with sensitive data are processed.

* Datadog [Log Monitors][8] notifications when they include [Log Samples][9]. Check specifically for monitors triggered during the period when sensitive data was being sent. 

* Datadog [Livetail][10], where logs are streamed in web browsers from your organization's users. There is no persistence beyond the 50 logs cached in browsers, and for broader queries, the result can be highly sampled.


## Fix the source of the data upstream

### Stop indexing sensitive logs

This is an optional step to prevent additional sensitive data from being sent to Datadog. However keep in mind that youâ€™ll still need to address the sensitive data already sent to Datadog.

* Find which index(es) logs holding sensitive data are susceptible to be routed.
* For each index, add an exclusion filter based on the sensitive outline query. It has to be **in the first place**.

### Stop sending sensitive data to Datadog

In case you have no straightforward way to change the loggers themselves, Datadog provides you with solutions to prevent compliance-sensitive data from being sent outside of your platform when using the [Datadog Agent][11] for Log Collection:

* [Scrub sensitive data][12] from your logs before you send them to Datadog.
* Alternatively, add fine-grained controls on which containers log collection happens with [Autodiscovery][13].

Similar scrubbing capabilities exist for the [Serverless Forwarder][14].


## Handle data already sent to Datadog

Take the following steps according to your compliance requirements. You might not need to run through all of them.

### Make sensitive logs un-queryable in Datadog (until they age-out)

This step is a handy way to mitigate compliance issues. It aims at making the logs with sensitive data - both logs that already sent and logs that might keep flowing in - not queryable in Datadog (Explorer, Dashboards, and Livetail). 

Use the [Data Access configuration page][15] and use the sensitive outline query to define a [restiction][16] that applies to everyone in your organization. 

**Note:** Using the **negation** of the sensitive outline query restricts users from seeing anything but matching logs.

### Patch your Archives

If you have to patch your archives to remove sensitive data, refer to the documented [format of archives][17] generated by Datadog.


### Reach out to support 

In case you have specific compliance questions or need a helping hand in fixing this, feel free to reach out to our [awesome support team][18]. When you contact our support team, it is helpful for you to have this information available to them:

* The sensitive outline query. Or anything that could define sensitive data such as a timerange, a service or an environment,
* Whether the sensitive data is still being sent into Datadog,
* Whether sensitive data has been indexed (in which index(es)) or turned into metrics,
* Whether you have already made sensitive data unqueryable.
