## Overview

Datadogâ€™s [Logging without Limits][1]* lets you dynamically decide what to include or exclude from your indexes. Log-based metrics are a cost-efficient way to summarize log data from the entire ingest stream. This means that even if you use [exclusion filters][2] to limit indexes to operationally critical logs, you can still visualize trends and anomalies over all of your log data at full granularity for 15 months.

With log-based metrics, you can record a count of logs that match a query or summarize a numeric value contained in a log, such as request duration.

## Generate a log-based metric

{{< img src="logs/processing/logs_to_metrics/generate_logs_to_metric.png" alt="Generate Logs to metric" responsive="true" style="width:80%;">}}

To generate a new log-based metric, go to the [Configuration page][3] of your Datadog account and select the *[Generate Metrics][4]* tab, then the **New Metric+** button.

### Add a new log-based metric

1. **Input a query to filter the log stream**: The query syntax is the same as for the [Log Explorer Search][5]. Only logs ingested with a timestamp within the past 20 minutes are considered for aggregation.
2. **Select the field you would like to track**: Select `*` to generate a count of all logs matching your query or enter a log attribute to aggregate a numeric value and create its corresponding `count`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, and `avg` aggregated metrics.
3. **Add dimensions to `group by`**: Select log attributes or tag keys to apply to the generated log-based metric to transform them into [Tags][6] following the `<KEY>:<VALUE>` format. Log-based metrics are considered [custom metrics][7]. Avoid grouping by unbounded or extremely high cardinality attributes like timestamps, user IDs, request IDs, or session IDs to avert impacting your billing.
4. **Name your metric**: Log-based metric names must follow the [naming metric convention][8].

**Note**: Data points for Log-based metrics are generated at one minute intervals.

### Update a log-based metric

After a metric is created, only these fields can be updated:

* Stream filter query
* Aggregation groups

To change the metric type or name, a new metric must be created.

Datadog would love to receive your feedback on this feature. You can submit your feedback directly from [this form][9].
