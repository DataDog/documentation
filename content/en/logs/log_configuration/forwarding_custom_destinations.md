## Overview

Log Forwarding allows you to send logs from Datadog to custom destinations like Splunk, Elasticsearch, and HTTP endpoints. This means that you can use [Log Pipelines][1] to centrally collect, process, and standardize your logs in Datadog. Then, send the logs from Datadog to other tools to support individual teams' workflows. You can choose to forward any of the ingested logs, whether or not they are indexed, to custom destinations. Logs are forwarded in JSON format and compressed with GZIP.

**Note**: Only Datadog users with the [`logs_write_forwarding_rules`][2] permission can [create][6], [edit][7], and [delete][8] custom destinations for forwarding logs.

{{< img src="logs/log_configuration/forwarding/forwarding_page.png" alt="The Log Forwarding page, showing custom destinations highlighted. The list of destinations includes Splunk (filtered by service:logs-processing), HTTP Endpoint (filtered by source:okta OR source:paloalto), and Elasticsearch (filtered by team:acme env:prod)." >}}

If a forwarding attempt fails (for example: if your destination temporarily becomes unavailable), Datadog retries periodically for 2 hours using an exponential backoff strategy. The first attempt is made following a 1-minute delay. For subsequent retries, the delay increases progressively to a maximum of 8-12 minutes (10 minutes with 20% variance).

The following metrics report on logs that have been forwarded successfully, including logs that were sent successfully after retries, as well as logs that were dropped.

- datadog.forwarding.logs.count


## Set up log forwarding to custom destinations

{{< site-region region="gov" >}}
<div class="alert alert-danger">Sending logs to a custom destination is outside of the Datadog GovCloud environment, which is outside the control of Datadog. Datadog shall not be responsible for any logs that have left the Datadog GovCloud environment, including without limitation, any obligations or requirements that the user may have related to FedRAMP, DoD Impact Levels, ITAR, export compliance, data residency or similar regulations applicable to such logs.</div>
{{< /site-region >}}

1. Add webhook IPs from the {{< region-param key="ip_ranges_url" link="true" text="IP ranges list">}} to the allowlist.
1. Navigate to [Log Forwarding][4].
3. Select **Custom Destinations**.
4. Click **New Destination**.
5. Enter the query to filter your logs for forwarding. See [Search Syntax][5] for more information.

{{% tab "HTTP" %}}

7. Enter a name for the destination.
8. In the **Define endpoint** field, enter the endpoint to which you want to send the logs. The endpoint must start with `https://`.
    - For example, if you want to send logs to Sumo Logic, follow their [Configure HTTP Source for Logs and Metrics documentation][1] to get the HTTP Source Address URL to send data to their collector. Enter the HTTP Source Address URL in the **Define endpoint** field.
9. In the **Configure Authentication** section, select one of the following authentication types and provide the relevant details:
  | Authentication Type      | Description                                                                                                              | Example                                                             |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Request Header**       | Provide the header name and value. Example for Authorization:<br>- Enter `Authorization` for **Header Name**.<br>- Use a header value formatted as `Basic username:password`, encoded in base64. | Header Name: `Authorization`<br>Header Value: `Basic bXlhY2NvdW50Om15cGFzc3dvcmQ=` |
