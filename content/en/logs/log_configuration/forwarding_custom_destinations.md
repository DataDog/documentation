## Overview

Log Forwarding allows you to send logs from Datadog to custom destinations like Splunk, Elasticsearch, and HTTP endpoints. This means that you can use [Log Pipelines][1] to centrally collect, process, and standardize your logs in Datadog. Then, send the logs from Datadog to other tools to support individual teamsâ€™ workflows. You can choose to forward any of the ingested logs, whether or not they are indexed, to custom destinations. Logs are forwarded in JSON format and compressed with GZIP.

The list of destinations includes Splunk (filtered by service:logs-processing), HTTP Endpoint (filtered by source:okta OR source:paloalto), and Elasticsearch (filtered by team:acme env:prod)." >}}

**Note**: Only Datadog users with the [`logs_write_forwarding_rules`][2] permission can create, edit, or delete custom destinations for forwarding logs.
