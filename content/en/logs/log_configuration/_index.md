## Overview

Datadog Logging without Limits* decouples log ingestion and indexing. Choose which logs to index and retain, or archive, and manage settings and controls at a top-level from the log configuration page at [**Logs > Configuration**][1].

**Note**: See [PCI DSS Compliance][2] for information on setting up a PCI-compliant Datadog organization.

## Configuration options

- Control how your logs are processed with [pipelines][3] and [processors][4].
- Set [attributes and aliasing][5] to unify your logs environment.
- [Generate metrics from ingested logs][6] as cost-efficient way to summarize log data from an entire ingested stream.
- Institute fine-grained control over your log management budget with [log indexes][7].
- Forward ingested logs to your own cloud-hosted storage bucket to keep as an [archive][8] for future troubleshooting or compliance audits.
- [Rehydrate an archive][9] to analyze or investigate log events that are older or excluded from indexing.
- Restrict [logs data access][10] with restriction queries.

## Log Explorer

Once you've completed configuration, start investigating and troubleshooting logs in the [Log Explorer][11].
