Log Indexes provide fine-grained control over your Log Management budget by allowing you to segment data into value groups for differing retention, quotas, usage monitoring, and billing. Indexes are located on the [Configuration page][1] in the Indexes section. Double click on them or click on the *edit* button to see more information about the number of logs that were indexed in the past 3 days, as well as the retention period for those logs:

{{< img src="logs/indexes/index_details.png" alt="index details"  style="width:70%;">}}

You can use indexed logs for [faceted searching][2], [patterns][3], [analytics][4], [dashboarding][5], and [monitoring][6].

## Multiple indexes

By default, each account has a single index representing a monolithic set of all your logs. Datadog also offers multiple indexes if you require:

* Multiple [retention periods](#update-log-retention)
* Multiple [daily quotas](#set-daily-quota), for finer budget control.

The Log Explorer supports [queries across multiple indexes][7].

### Add indexes

If multiple indexes is activated, use the "New Index" button to create a new index.

{{< img src="logs/indexes/add-index.png" alt="Add index"  style="width:70%;">}}

**Note**: Index names must start with a letter and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, or the '-' character.

## Indexes filters

Index filters allow dynamic control over which logs flow into which indexes.  For example, if you create a first index filtered on the `status:notice` attribute, a second index filtered to the `status:error` attribute, and a final one without any filter (the equivalent of `*`), all your `status:notice` logs would go to the first index, all your `status:error` logs to the second index, and the rest would go to the final one.

{{< img src="logs/indexes/multi_index.png" alt="Multi indexes"  style="width:70%;">}}

**Note**: **Logs enter the first index whose filter they match on**, use drag and drop on the list of indexes to reorder them according to your use-case.

## Exclusion filters

By default, logs indexes have no exclusion filter: that is to say all logs matching the Index Filter are indexed.

But because your logs are not all and equally valuable, exclusion filters control which logs flowing in your index should be removed. Excluded logs are discarded from indexes, but still flow through the [Livetail][8] and can be used to [generate metrics][9] and [archived][10].

Exclusion filters are defined by a query, a sampling rule, and a active/inactive toggle:

* Default **query** is `*`, meaning all logs flowing in the index would be excluded. Scope down exclusion filter to only a subset of logs [with a log query][11].
* Default **sampling rule** is `Exclude 100% of logs` matching the query. Adapt sampling rate from 0% to 100%, and decide if the sampling rate applies on individual logs, or group of logs defined by the unique values of any attribute.
* Default **toggle** is active, meaning logs flowing in the index are actually discarded according to the exclusion filter configuration. Toggle this to inactive to ignore this exclusion filter for new logs flowing in the index.

**Note**: Index filters for logs are only processed with the first **active** exclusion filter matched. If a log matches an exclusion filter (even if the log is not sampled out), it ignores all following exclusion filters in the sequence.

Use drag and drop on the list of exclusion filters to reorder them according to your use case.

### Examples

#### Switch off, switch on

You might not need your DEBUG logs until you actually need them when your platform undergoes an incident, or want to carefully observe the deployment of a critical version of your application. Setup a 100% exclusion filter on the `status:DEBUG`, and toggle it on and off from Datadog UI or through the [API][12] when required.

{{< img src="logs/indexes/enable_index_filters.png" alt="enable index filters"  style="width:80%;">}}

#### Keep an eye on trends

Let's say now you don't want to keep all logs from your web access server requests. You could choose to index all 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx logs, but exclude 95% of the 2xx logs: `source:nginx AND http.status_code:[200 TO 299]` to keep track of the trends.
**Tip**: Transform web access logs into meaningful KPIs with a [metric generated from your logs][9], counting number of requests and tagged by status code, [browser][13] and [country][14].

{{< img src="logs/indexes/sample_200.png" alt="enable index filters"  style="width:80%;">}}

#### Sampling consistently with higher-level entities

You have millions of users connecting to your website everyday. And although you don't need observability on every single user, you still want to keep the full picture for some. Set up an exclusion filter applying to all production logs (`env:production`) and exclude logs for 90% of the `@user.email`:

{{< img src="logs/indexes/sample_user_id.png" alt="enable index filters"  style="width:80%;">}}

You can use APM in conjunction with Logs, thanks to [trace ID injection in logs][15]. As for users, you don't need to keep all your logs but making sure logs always give the full picture to a trace is critical for troubleshooting.
Set up an exclusion filter applied to logs from your instrumented service (`service:my_python_app`) and exclude logs for 50% of the `Trace ID` - make sure to use the [trace ID remapper][16] upstream in your pipelines.

{{< img src="logs/indexes/sample_trace_id.png" alt="enable index filters"  style="width:80%;">}}

To ensure sampling consistency across multiple indexes:

1. Create one exclusion rule in each index.
2. Use the **same sampling rate** and the **same attribute** defining the higher level entity for all exclusion rules.
3. Double-check exclusion rules, **filters**, and **respective order** (logs only pass through the first matching exclusion rule).

In the following example:

{{< img src="logs/indexes/cross-index_sampling.png" alt="enable index filters"  style="width:80%;">}}

* In general, all logs with a specific `request_id` are either kept or excluded (with 50% probability).
* Logs with a `threat:true` or `compliance:true` tag are kept regardless of the `request_id`.
* `DEBUG` logs are indexed consistently with the `request_id` sampling rule, unless the debug logs exclusion filter is enabled in which case they are sampled.
* 50% of the `2XX` web access logs with an actual `request_id` are kept. All other `2XX` web access logs are sampled based on the 90% exclusion filter rule.

## Update log retention

The index retention setting determines how long logs are stored and searchable in Datadog. You can set the retention to any value allowed in your account configuration.
To add retentions that are not in your current contract contact [Datadog support][17].

{{< img src="logs/indexes/log_retention.png" alt="index details"  style="width:70%;">}}

## Set daily quota

You can set a daily quota to hard-limit the number of logs that are stored within an Index per day. This quota is applied for all logs that should have been stored (i.e. after exclusion filters are applied).
Once the daily quota is reached, logs are no longer indexed but are still available in the [livetail][18], [sent to your archives][10], and used to [generate metrics from logs][9].

Update or remove this quota at any time when editing the Index:

{{< img src="logs/indexes/index_quota.png" alt="index details"  style="width:70%;">}}

**Note**: Indexes daily quotas reset automatically at [2:00pm UTC][19].

An event is generated when the daily quota is reached:

{{< img src="logs/indexes/index_quota_event.png" alt="index quota notification"  style="width:70%;">}}

Follow our [Log Usage guide][20] to see how to monitor and alert on your usage.
