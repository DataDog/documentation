Often, log files, especially system logs such as *syslog* or *journald*, have heightened read-permissions blocking Datadog Agent log collection as it does not have *sudo* or *admin* access.  

There are three potential solutions to get around this:  

* (Not Recommended) Give the Agent root access so it can tail those files. Datadog strongly recommends against going this route.
* Change the file permission to let the Agent access it.
* Configure an open source log shipper (such as Rsyslog, NXLog, ...) that has root access to send those logs either directly to your Datadog platform or locally to a running Datadog Agent. All configuration are explained in the [How to Send Logs to Datadog via External Log Shippers?][1] article.
