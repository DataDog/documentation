To send your Go logs to Datadog, log to a file and then tail that file with your Datadog Agent. You can use the following setup with [logrus][1], an open source logging library.

Datadog strongly encourages setting up your logging library to produce your logs in JSON to avoid the need for [custom parsing rules][2].

## Configure your logger

For a classic Go configuration, open a `main.go` file and paste in the following code:

```go
package main

import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {

    // use JSONFormatter
    log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})

    // log an event as usual with logrus
    log.WithFields(log.Fields{"string": "foo", "int": 1, "float": 1.1 }).Info("My first event from golang to stdout")
}
```

You can add metas to any log if you provide a JSON object that you want to see in the log event.

These metas can be `hostname`, `username`, `customers`, `metric` or any information that can help you troubleshoot and understand what happens in your Go application.

```go
package main

import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {

    // use JSONFormatter
    log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})

    // log an event with logrus
    log.WithFields(log.Fields{"string": "foo", "int": 1, "float": 1.1 }).Info("My first event from golang to stdout")
    
  // for metadata, a common pattern is to reuse fields between logging statements by reusing
  contextualizedLog := log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "hostname": "staging-1",
    "appname": "foo-app",
    "session": "1ce3f6v"
  })

  contextualizedLog.Info("Simple event with global metadata")
}
```

## Configure your Datadog Agent

Once [log collection is enabled][3], set up [custom log collection][4] to tail your log files and send new logs to Datadog.

1. Create a `go.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` [Agent configuration directory][5].
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in `go.d/` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    ##Log section
    logs:

      - type: file
        path: "/path/to/your/go/log.log"
        service: go
        source: go
        sourcecategory: sourcecode
    ```

3. [Restart the Agent][6].
4. Run the [Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `go` under the `Checks` section to confirm logs are successfully submitted to Datadog.

If logs are in JSON format, Datadog automatically [parses the log messages][8] to extract log attributes. Use the [Log Explorer][9] to view and troubleshoot your logs.

## Connect logs and traces

If APM is enabled for this application, the correlation between application logs and traces can be improved by following the [APM Go logging documentation][10] to automatically add trace and span IDs in your logs.

## Best practices

* Name the logger with a name that corresponds to the relevant functionality or service.
* Use the `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `FATAL` log levels. In Datadog, Go's `FATAL` maps to a severity level of `Emergency`.
* Start with logging the information that is most important. Expand the comprehensiveness of your logging with further iterations.
* Use metas to add context to any log. This enables you to quickly filter over users, customers, business-centric attributes, etc.
