<div class="alert alert-warning"><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/">OpenTelemetry logging</a> and Datadog Exporter's feature for sending logs to Datadog are in alpha.</div>

## Overview

[OpenTelemetry][1] (OTel) is an open source observability framework that provides IT teams with standardized protocols and tools for collecting and routing telemetry data. Created as an incubator project by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][2] (CNCF), OTel provides a consistent format for instrumenting, generating, gathering, and exporting application telemetry data—namely metrics, logs, and traces—to monitoring platforms for analysis and insight.

The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent process for collecting and exporting telemetry data emitted by many processes. Datadog has an [Exporter][3] available for the OpenTelemetry Collector which allows you to forward traces, metrics, and logs data from OpenTelemetry to Datadog. 

For collecting logs, Datadog recommends using the Collector’s [filelog receiver][4]. The filelog receiver tails the log files that you specify. Then the Datadog Exporter (set up in the Collector) sends the log data to Datadog.

## Set up the Collector and Datadog Exporter

See [Running the Collector][5] and [Configuring the Datadog Exporter][6].

#### Logs and traces correlation

If you are using the Datadog Exporter to also send OpenTelemetry traces to Datadog, use the `trace_parser` operator to extract the `trace_id` from each trace and add it to the associated logs. Datadog automatically correlates the related logs and traces. See [Connect OpenTelemetry Traces and Logs][7] for more information.

## Configure the logger for your application

Since the OpenTelemetry SDKs’ logging functionality is not fully supported (see your specific language in the [OpenTelemetry documentation][8] for more information), Datadog recommends using a standard logging library for your application. Follow the language-specific [Log Collection documentation][9] to set up the appropriate logger in your application. Datadog strongly encourages setting up your logging library to output your logs in JSON to avoid the need for [custom parsing rules][10]. 

## Configure the filelog receiver

Configure the filelog receiver using [operators][11]. For example, if there is a service `checkoutservice` that is writing logs to `/var/log/pods/services/checkout/0.log`, a sample log might look like this:

```
{"level":"info","message":"order confirmation email sent to \"jack@example.com\"","service":"checkoutservice","span_id":"197492ff2b4e1c65","timestamp":"2022-10-10T22:17:14.841359661Z","trace_id":"e12c408e028299900d48a9dd29b0dc4c"}
```

Example filelog configuration:

```
filelog:
   include:
     - /var/log/pods/**/*checkout*/*.log
   start_at: end
   poll_interval: 500ms
   operators:
     - id: parse_log
       type: json_parser
       parse_from: body
     - id: trace
       type: trace_parser
       trace_id:
         parse_from: attributes.trace_id
       span_id:
         parse_from: attributes.span_id
   attributes:
     ddtags: env:staging
```

- `include`: The list of files the receiver tails 
- `start_at: end`: Indicates to read new content that is being written 
- `poll_internal`: Sets the poll frequency 
- Operators:
    - `json_parser`: Parses JSON logs. By default, the filelog receiver converts each log line into a log record, which is the `body` of the logs’ [data model][12]. Then, the `json_parser` converts the JSON body into attributes in the data model.
    - `trace_parser`: Extract the `trace_id` and `span_id` from the log to correlate logs and traces in Datadog. 

## Using Kubernetes

There are multiple ways to deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and Datadog Exporter in a Kubernetes infrastructure. For the filelog receiver to work, the [Agent/DaemonSet deployment][13] is the recommended deployment method.

In containerized environments, applications write logs to `stdout` or `stderr`. Kubernetes collects the logs and writes them to a standard location. You need to mount the location on the host node into the Collector for the filelog receiver. Below is an [extension example][14] with the mounts required for sending logs.
