## Archives

Configure your Datadog account to forward all the logs ingested to a cloud storage system. This allows you to keep in long-term storage all the logs that you used Datadog to aggregate. You can then opt to rehydrate these archived log events in order to analyze them with the Log Explorer.


Note: only Datadog users with admin status can create, modify, or delete log archive configurations.
