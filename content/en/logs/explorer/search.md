## Overview

Log Explorer search consists of a time range and a search query, mixing `key:value` and full-text search.

### Search query

For example, to filter on logs produced by a specific service, with a specific status, over the past five minutes, you can create a custom query such as `service:payment status:error rejected` and set the time range to the `Past 5 minutes`:

[Indexed Logs][3] support both full-text search and `key:value` search queries.

{{< site-region region="gov,us3,us5" >}}
**Note**: `key:value` queries require that you [declare a facet][1] beforehand.

{{< /site-region >}}

{{< site-region region="us,eu" >}}
**Note**: `key:value` queries **do not** require that you [declare a facet][1] beforehand.

[1]: /logs/explorer/facets/
{{< /site-region >}}

### Search syntax

To begin searching for logs in Log Explorer, see the [Log Search Syntax documentation][1] and read the [time frame documentation][2] for more details on custom time frames.
