## Overview

While information from individual logs can be useful visualized as a list, sometimes valuable information can be accessed through aggregation. To access this information, search for logs in the [Log Explorer][5] and display them as timeseries, top lists, tree maps, pie charts, or tables.

Log Explorer search consists of a time range and a search query, mixing `key:value` and full-text search. 

## Search query

For example, to filter on logs produced by a web store service, with an error status, over the past fifteen minutes, create a custom query like `service:payment status:error rejected` and set the time range to the `Past 15 minutes`:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/search_filter.png" alt="Create a search query in the Log Explorer that filters for error logs of rejected payments for a web store service" style="width:100%;" >}}

[Indexed Logs][1] support both full-text search and `key:value` search queries.

**Note**: `key:value` queries **do not** require that you [declare a facet][2] beforehand.

## Search syntax

To start searching for logs and customizing the time frame in the Log Explorer, read the [Search Syntax documentation][3] and the [Custom Time Frames documentation][4].
