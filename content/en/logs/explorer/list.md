## Overview

The Log List displays indexed logs and offers privileged tools to navigate in **individual results**.

Filter logs with a search query (see [faceted search][1], or [search query syntax][2] for advanced use cases) and time navigation. Explore log results in the table, and focus on any log with the [Log Side Panel][3].

## Logs Table

The Log Search is displayed in the logs table.

Manage the columns of the table using either:

- The _table itself_, with interactions available in the first row. This is the preferred option to **sort**, **rearrange**, or **remove** columns.
- The _facet panel_ the the left, or the _log side panel_ on the right. This is the preferred option to **add** a column for a field.

With the _Options_ button, control the **number of lines** displayed in the table per log event.

The configuration of the log table is stored alongside other elements of your troubleshooting context in [Saved Views][4]

## Export View
