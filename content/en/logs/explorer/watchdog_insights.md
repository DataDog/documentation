## Overview

Datadog Log Management offers Watchdog Insights to help you resolve incidents faster with contextual insights in the Log Explorer. Watchdog Insights complement your expertise and instincts by surfacing suspect anomalies, outliers, and potential performance bottlenecks impacting a subset of users.

## Navigation

The Watchdog Insights banner appears in the [Log Explorer][1] and displays insights about the current query:

To see an overview of all insights, expand the Watchdog Insight banner:

To access the full Watchdog Insights side panel, click **View all**:

Every insight comes with embedded interactions and a side panel with troubleshooting information. The insight interactions and side panel vary based on the Watchdog Insight type.

## Insight Types

### Log Anomaly Detection

Ingested logs are analyzed at the intake level where Watchdog performs aggregations on detected patterns as well as `environment`, `service`, `source` and `status` tags.
These aggregated logs are scanned for anomalous behaviors, such as the following:

- An emergence of logs with a warning or error status.
- A sudden increase of logs with a warning or error status.


The logs surface as Insights in the Log Explorer, matching the search context and any restrictions applied to your role.

Click on a specific insight to see the full description of the detected anomaly as well as the list of patterns contributing to it.

Anomalies that Watchdog determines to be particularly severe are also surfaced in the [Watchdog alerts feed][6]. Set up a [Watchdog logs monitor][7] to be notified whenever Watchdog finds one of these anomalies.

For more information about searching logs in the Log Explorer, see [Log Search Syntax][2] and [Custom Time Frames][3].

### Error Outliers

Error outliers display fields such as [faceted tags or attributes][4] containing characteristics of errors that match the current query. Statistically overrepresented `key:value` pairs among errors provide hints into the root cause of problems.

Typical examples of error outliers include `env:staging`, `docker_image:acme:3.1`, and `http.useragent_details.browser.family:curl`.

In the **banner card** view, you can see:

  * The field name.
  * The proportion of errors and overall logs that the field contributes to.

In the **side panel card** view, you can see the main [log pattern][5] of error logs with the field.

{{< img src="logs/explorer/watchdog_insights/error_outlier_l_card.png" alt="Error Outlier card (L)" style="width:100%;" >}}

In the **full side panel** view, you can see:

  * The timeseries of error logs that contain the field.
  * Tags that are often associated with the error logs.
  * A comprehensive list of [log patterns][5].
