## Overview

Investigating large volumes of log data can be time consuming: you can spend hours on them and still understand only a fraction of them. However, application logs often look the same with some fraction of them varying. These are what we call *patterns*.

In the Log Explorer, patterns can be surfaced automatically to bring structure to the problem and help you quickly see what mattersâ€”exclude what's irrelevant.

The patterns view is helpful for detecting and filtering noisy error patterns that might cause you to miss other issues. It shows the number of logs matching a pattern, split by service and status.

## See log trends and newcomers over time

Switch to the patterns view to automatically see your log patterns for the selected context. A [context][1] is composed of a time range and a search query.

Each pattern comes with highlights, to get you straight to its characteristic features:

* Sections of the logs that vary within the pattern are highlighted, to help you quickly identify differences across log lines.
* A mini graph displays a rough timeline for the volume of its logs, to help you identify how that pattern differs from other patterns.

Click on a pattern to see a sample of underlying logs, and eventually display one single log.

**Note**: The pattern detection is based on 10,000 log samples. Refine the search to see patterns limited to a specific subset of logs.
