## Overview
Datadog displays individual logs following this general side panel layout:

{{< img src="logs/explorer/side_panel/overview.png" alt="Log Explorer side panel"  style="width:60%;">}}

- The upper part of the panel displays general **context** information
- The lower part of the panel displays the actual **content** of the log

**Context** refers to the infrastructure and application context which the log has generated. Information is gathered from tags, whether automatically attached (host name, container name, log file name, serverless function name, etc.) or added through custom tags (team in charge, environment, application version, etc.) to the log by the Datadog Agent or Log Forwarder.

**Content** refers to the log itself. This includes the log message, as well as all structured information extracted and enriched from the logs through [Log Pipelines][1]. For logs generated by common components of a technical stack, parsing and enriching comes out-of-the-box.

- For file log collection, make sure you properly set up the source field, which triggers file log collection. See [Log Integrations][2] for reference.
- For container log collection, use [Autodiscovery][3].

Some standard fields, for instance `error.stack`, `http.method`, or `duration`, have specific enhanced displays in the Log Panel for better readability. Extract corresponding information from your logs and remap your attributes with [standard attribute remappers][4].

## A Hub To Other Data Sources

### Correlate with infrastructure data

The **View in context** button updates the search request in order to show you the log lines dated just before and after a selected log, even if they don't match your filter. This context is different according to the situation, as Datadog uses the `Hostname`, `Service`, `filename`, and `container_id` attributes, along with tags, in order find the appropriate context for your logs.

Click on the **Metrics** tab and access underlying infrastructure metrics in a 30 minutes timeframe around the log.

Interact with **Host** in the upper reserved attributes section, the related [host dashboard][5], or [network page][6]. Interact with **Container** sections to jump to the [container page][7] scoped with the underlying parameters.

In case logs comes from a serverless source, the Host Section is replaced with a Serverless section that links jump to the corresponding [serverless page][8].

### Correlate with APM data

Make sure you enable [trace injection in logs][9] and follow the [Unified Service Tagging][10] best practices to benefit from all the capabilities of Logs and APM correlation.

Click on the **APM Tab** and see a log in the context of its whole trace, with upstream and downstream services running. Deep dive in APM data and the [trace in APM][11] feature.

Interact with the **Service** section to refocus the search in the Log Explorer and see all other logs from the same trace.

## Configure your troubleshooting context

Interact with the attributes names and values in the lower JSON section to:

- Add or remove a column from the logs table
- Append the search request with specific values (include or exclude)

{{< img src="logs/explorer/side_panel/context.gif" alt="Side Panel context"  style="width:100%;">}}

- Build or edit a facet or measure from an attribute. See [Log Facets][12].

## Share a log

Use the **Share** button to share the log opened in side panel to other contexts.

- **Copy to clipboard** or `Ctrl+C` / `Cmd+C` copies the log JSON to your clipboard.
- **Share Event** shares the log (along with the underlying view) with teammates through email, Slack, and more. See all [Datadog notification integrations][13] available.
