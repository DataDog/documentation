## Overview

The [**Log Explorer**][1] is your home base for log troubleshooting and exploration. Whether you start from scratch, from a [Saved View][2], or land here from any other context like monitor notifications or dashboard widgets, you can search and filter, group, visualize, and export logs in the Log Explorer.

## Search and filter

**Search** and **Filter** on logs to narrow down, broaden, or shift your focus on a subset of logs tailored to your current interest.

  - To learn more about searching for logs in the Log Explorer, read [Search Logs][3].
  - To start creating queries and using facets in the Log Explorer, read [Log Search Syntax][4].
  - To learn how [Watchdog Insights][9] surface anomalous logs and outliers in error logs within your search context, read [Watchdog Insights for Logs][5].

## Analyze

**Group** your queried logs into higher-level entities such as fields, patterns, and transactions in order to derive or consolidate information. 

To start identifying patterns and aggregating logs by subsets of events, see [Log Analytics][6].

## Visualize

**Visualize** the outcome of your filters and aggregations to better understand your logs and gather decisive information. For example, you can view your logs in a list to organize your log data into columns, or in a timeseries graph to measure your log data over time. 

To start visualizing log data in the Log Explorer, see [Log Visualizations][7].

## Export

You can also **export** your Log Explorer view to reuse it later or in different contexts. 

To learn how to export your log queries and visualizations, see [Export Logs][8].
