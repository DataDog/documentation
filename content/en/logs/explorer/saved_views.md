## Log Explorer Default View

The default log explorer view is loaded where you land on the Logs Search, Analytics, or Patterns pages from the main navigation menu, or enter the corresponding URLs into your browser.

The default view includes:

* an empty query
* a list of visible facets in the facet list
* a basic page layout (e.g. table configuration for search, visualization options for analytics, etc.)

All edits on the facet list (see below) or in the page layout are automatically saved in this default view.

## Saved Views

Saved Views allow you to save search customizations in the Log Explorer, including:

* A [search query][1]
* A [selected subset of facets][2]
* A customized default visualization ([log stream][3], [log patterns][4], or [log analytics][5] along with their specific visualization properties)

Saved Views can be removed directly from the Saved View list in the Logs Explorer. Hover over the name of the Saved View to reveal its **delete** button. Click on it and confirm.
