## Overview

Add the Threat Intel Process to evaluate logs against the table using a specific Indicator of Compromise (IoC) key, such as an IP address. If a match is found, the log is enriched with relevant Threat Intelligence (TI) attributes from the table, which enhances detection, investigation, and response.

For more information, see [Threat Intelligence][9].
