## Overview

The [**Quality Gate Rules** page][1] is useful for developers who want to keep an eye on the quality gates for their build pipelines. You can see all of the rules defined by the organization.

Use this page to create a rule, edit an existing rule, or click on a rule to investigate its past executions.

## Search for rules

To see your quality gate rules, navigate to [**Software Delivery** > **Quality Gates** > **Quality Gate Rules**][1].

You can filter the page by rule name to see the rules you're most concerned with. Click on a rule to investigate details that show, for example, what commit might have introduced a performance regression or build error. 

## Explore rule executions

Click into a specific rule execution to see the results for past rule execution, including the status and specific conditions.
