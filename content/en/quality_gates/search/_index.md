## Search for rules

To see your quality gate rules, navigate to [**Software Delivery** > **Quality Gates** > **Quality Gate Rules**][1].

The [**Quality Gate Rules** page][1] shows all of the rules defined by the organization. Use this page to create a rule, edit an existing rule, or click on a rule to investigate its past executions.

You can filter the page by rule name to see the rules you're most concerned with. Click on a rule to investigate details that show, for example, what commit might have introduced a performance regression or build error. 

## Explore rule executions

Click into a specific rule execution to see the _Rule Details_ page which provides a view of the data for the Quality Gate rule you selected over a specified time frame.
