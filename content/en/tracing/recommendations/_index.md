APM Recommendations are in Preview. Features and recommendations may change before general availability.
{{< /beta-callout >}}

APM Recommendations help you optimize your applications' performance, reliability, and error rates by providing optimization opportunities based on the telemetry collected on your applications. These recommendations are designed to:

- Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- Improve service reliability and uptime
- Reduce error rates and improve end-user experience

## How it works

APM Recommendations are based on data collected from different parts of your stack:

- Sessions and user journeys from Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Distributed traces from Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Error data from Error Tracking
- Database telemetry from Database Monitoring (DBM)

By looking at these sources together, Datadog finds ways to help you improve performance, reliability, and user experience.
