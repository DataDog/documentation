APM Recommendations are in Preview. Features and recommendations may change before general availability.
{{< /beta-callout >}}

APM Recommendations help you optimize your applications' performance, reliability, and error rates by providing optimization opportunities based on the telemetry collected on your applications. These recommendations are designed to:

- Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
- Improve service reliability and uptime
- Reduce error rates and improve end-user experience

{{< img src="/tracing/recommendations/apm_recommendations.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:100%;" >}}

## Prerequisites

Certain recommendations rely on specific Datadog products. Use the **Recommendation Prerequisite** dropdown to filter for the recommendations you can expect to see based on your specific setup.

## How it works

APM Recommendations are based on data collected from different parts of your stack:

- Sessions and user journeys from Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Distributed traces from Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Error data from Error Tracking
- Database telemetry from Database Monitoring (DBM)

By looking at these sources together, Datadog finds ways to help you improve performance, reliability, and user experience.

## Using APM Recommendations

To review recommendations that need your attention:

1. Go to [**APM** > **Recommendations**][1].
2. Review the recommendations in **For Review**.
3. Select a recommendation from the list to see more details. about the problem, impact, and how to resolve it.
4. Review the problem, impact, and Datadog's recommendation for resolving it.

After you've addressed the recommendation, you can use the **FOR REVIEW** dropdown to change the recommendation status to *Reviewed*, *Ignored*, or *Resolved*. Alternatively, you can click **Create Case** to assign the recommendation to an owner and track related work.
