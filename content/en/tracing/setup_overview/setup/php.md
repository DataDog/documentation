## Compatibility requirements

For a full list of supported libraries and language versions, visit the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Installation and getting started

### Follow the in-app documentation (recommended)

Follow the [Quickstart instructions][2] within the Datadog app for the best experience, including:

- Step-by-step instructions scoped to your deployment configuration (hosts, Docker, Kubernetes, or Amazon ECS).
- Dynamically set `service`, `env`, and `version` tags.
- Enable ingesting 100% of traces during setup.

For descriptions of terminology used in APM, take a look at the [official documentation][3].

For details about open-source contributions to the PHP tracer, refer to the [contributing guide][4].

### Configure the Datadog Agent for APM

Install and configure the Datadog Agent to receive traces from your now instrumented application. By default the Datadog Agent is enabled in your `datadog.yaml` file under `apm_config` with `enabled: true` and listens for trace traffic at `localhost:8126`. For containerized environments, follow the links below to enable trace collection within the Datadog Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Containers" %}}

1. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` in the `apm_config` section of your main [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][1].

2. See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

{{< partial name="apm/apm-containers.html" >}}
</br>

3. After having instrumented your application, the tracing client sends traces to `localhost:8126` by default.  If this is not the correct host and port change it by setting the below env variables:

    `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`.

    See [environment variable configuration](#environment-variable-configuration) for more information on how to set these variables.
{{< site-region region="us3,eu,gov" >}} 

4. Set `DD_SITE` in the Datadog Agent to {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} to ensure the Agent sends data to the right Datadog location.

{{< /site-region >}}

### Install the extension

Install the PHP extension using one of the [precompiled packages for supported distributions][5].

Once downloaded, install the package with one of the commands below.

```shell
# using RPM package (RHEL/Centos 6+, Fedora 20+)
rpm -ivh datadog-php-tracer.rpm

# using DEB package (Debian Jessie+ , Ubuntu 14.04+ on supported PHP versions)
dpkg -i datadog-php-tracer.deb

# using APK package (Alpine)
apk add datadog-php-tracer.apk --allow-untrusted
```

The extension will be installed for the default PHP version. To install the extension for a specific PHP version, use the `DD_TRACE_PHP_BIN` environment variable to set the location of the target PHP binary before installing.

```shell
export DD_TRACE_PHP_BIN=$(which php-fpm7)
```

Restart PHP (PHP-FPM or the Apache SAPI) and then visit a tracing-enabled endpoint of your application. View the [APM UI][6] to see the traces.

**Note**: It might take a few minutes before traces appear in the UI. If traces still do not appear after a few minutes, [create a `phpinfo()` page][7] from the host machine and scroll down to the "ddtrace" section. Failed diagnostic checks will appear here to help identify any issues.

If you can't find your distribution, you can [manually install][8] the PHP extension.

## Automatic instrumentation

Tracing is automatically enabled by default. Once the extension is installed, **ddtrace** traces your application and sends traces to the Agent.

Datadog supports all web frameworks out of the box. Automatic instrumentation works by modifying PHP's runtime to wrap certain functions and methods to trace them. The PHP tracer supports automatic instrumentation for several libraries.

Automatic instrumentation captures:

* Method execution time
* Relevant trace data, such as URL and status response codes for web requests or SQL queries for database access
* Unhandled exceptions, including stacktraces if available
* A total count of traces (e.g., web requests) flowing through the system

**Note**: If your application does not use Composer nor an autoloader registered with `spl_autoload_register()`, set the environment variable, `DD_TRACE_NO_AUTOLOADER=true`, to enable automatic instrumentation.

## Configuration

The PHP tracer can be configured using environment variables.

**Note**: If you use code auto-instrumentation (the recommended approach) be aware that the instrumenting code is executed before any user code. As a result, the environment variables below must be set at the server level and be available to the PHP runtime before any user code is executed. For example, `putenv()` and `.env` files would not work.

### Apache

For Apache with php-fpm, use the `env` directory in your `www.conf` configuration file to configure the php tracer, for example:

```
; Example of passing the host environment variable SOME_ENV
; to the PHP process as DD_AGENT_HOST
env[DD_AGENT_HOST] = $SOME_ENV
; Example of passing the value 'my-app' to the PHP
; process as DD_SERVICE
env[DD_SERVICE] = my-app
```

Alternatively, you can use [`SetEnv`][9] from the server config, virtual host, directory, or `.htaccess` file.

```text
SetEnv DD_TRACE_DEBUG true
```

### NGINX

For NGINX, use the `env` directive in the php-fpm's `www.conf` file, for example:

```
; Example of passing the host environment variable SOME_ENV
; to the PHP process as DD_AGENT_HOST
env[DD_AGENT_HOST] = $SOME_ENV
; Example of passing the value 'my-app' to the PHP
; process as DD_SERVICE
env[DD_SERVICE] = my-app
```

**Note**: If you have enabled APM for your NGINX server, make sure you have properly configured the `opentracing_fastcgi_propagate_context` setting for distributed tracing to properly work. See [NGINX APM configuration][10] for more details.

### PHP CLI server

#### Map resource names to normalized URI

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Deprecation notice:</strong> As of version <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/tag/0.47.0">0.47.0</a> the legacy setting <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING</code> is deprecated. It still works for the foreseeable future but it is strongly encouraged that you use the new settings outlined in this paragraph to avoid issues when legacy support is removed.

Note that setting any of the following: <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX</code>, <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING</code>, and <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING</code> will opt-in to the new resource normalization approach and any value in <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING</code> will be ignored.
</div>

For HTTP server and client integrations, the URL is used to form the trace resource name in the format `<HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD> <NORMALIZED_URL>`, with the query string removed from the URL. This allows better visibility in any custom framework that is not automatically instrumented by normalizing the URLs and grouping together generic endpoints under one resource.

| HTTP Request                       | Resource Name |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------|
| **GET** request to `/foo?a=1&b=2`  | `GET /foo`    |
| **POST** request to `/bar?foo=bar` | `POST /bar`   |

Numeric IDs, UUIDs (with and without dashes), and 32-to-512-bit hexadecimal hashes are automatically replaced with a `?` character.

| URL (GET request)                              | Resource Name      |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `/user/123/show`                               | `GET /user/?/show` |
| `/widget/b7a992e0-3300-4030-8617-84553b11c993` | `GET /widget/?`    |
| `/api/v2/b7a992e033004030861784553b11c993/123` | `GET /api/v2/?/?`  |
| `/book/0dbf3596`                               | `GET /book/?`      |

You can turn this functionality OFF using `DD_TRACE_URL_AS_RESOURCE_NAMES_ENABLED=false`.

##### Custom URL-to-resource mapping

There are a few cases that are not covered by the automatic normalization that is applied.

| URL (GET request)                | Expected Resource Name        |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| `/using/prefix/id123/for/id`    | `GET /using/prefix/?/for/id`  |
| `/articles/slug-of-title`        | `GET /articles/?`             |
| `/cities/new-york/rivers`        | `GET /cities/?/rivers`        |
| `/nested/cities/new-york/rivers` | `GET /nested/cities/?/rivers` |

There are two classes of scenarios that are not covered by automatic normalization:

  - The path fragment to normalize has a reproducible pattern and can be present in any part of the url, for example `id<number>` in the example above. This scenario is covered by the setting `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX` below.
  - The path fragment can be anything, and the previous path fragment indicates that a value has to be normalized. For example `/cities/new-york` tells us that `new-york` has to be normalized as it is the name of a city. This scenario is covered by settings `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING` and `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING` for incoming and outgoing requests respectively.

###### `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX`

This setting is a CSV of one or more regular expressions that are applied to every path fragment independently. For example, setting `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX` to `^id\d+$` for a path of `/using/prefix/id123/for/id` applies the regex to each of the fragments: `using`, `prefix`, `id123`, `for`, and `id`.

| URL                          | regex     | Expected Resource Name       |
|:-----------------------------|:----------|:-----------------------------|
| `/using/prefix/id123/for/id` | `^id\d+$` | `GET /using/prefix/?/for/id` |

Note that because the format of this variable is a CSV, the comma character `,` is not escaped and cannot be used in your regular expressions.

###### `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING` and `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING`

This setting is a CSV of patterns that can contain a wildcard `*`. For example, adding the pattern `cities/*` means that every time the fragment `cities` is found while analyzing a URL, then the next fragment, if any, will be replaced with `?`. Patterns are applied at any depth, so applying the following rule will both normalize `/cities/new-york` and `/nested/cities/new-york` in the table above.

Patterns can be applied to a part of a specific fragment. For example `path/*-fix` would normalize the url `/some/path/changing-fix/nested` to `/some/path/?-fix/nested`

Note that `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING` applies to only incoming requests (for example web frameworks) while `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING` only applies to outgoing requests (for example `curl` and `guzzle` requests).

### `open_basedir` restrictions

When [`open_basedir`][11] setting is used, then `/opt/datadog-php` should be added to the list of allowed directories.
When the application runs in a docker container, the path `/proc/self` should also be added to the list of allowed directories.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the PHP tracer, [download the latest release][5] and follow the same steps as [installing the extension](#install-the-extension).

Once the installation is completed restart PHP (PHP-FPM or the Apache SAPI).

**Note**: If you are using second level caching in OPcache by setting the parameter `opcache.file_cache`, remove the cache folder.

## Removing

To remove the PHP tracer:

1. For php-fpm, stop the php-fpm service, otherwise stop the Apache web server.
2. Unlink files `98-ddtrace.ini` and `99-ddtrace-custom.ini` from your php configuration folder.
3. For php-fpm, restart php-fpm service, otherwise restart the Apache web server.

**Note**: If you are using second level caching in OPcache by setting the parameter `opcache.file_cache`, remove the cache folder.

## Troubleshooting an application crash

In the unusual event of an application crash caused by the PHP tracer, typically because of a segmentation fault, the best thing to do is obtain a core dump and contact Datadog support.

### Obtaining a core dump

Obtaining a core dump for PHP applications can be tricky, especially on PHP-FPM. Here are a few tips to help you obtain a core dump:

1. Determine whether the PHP-FPM generated a core dump by looking in the application error log:
   - Search for `(SIGSEGV - core dumped)` because a message like this means it has been dumped: `WARNING: [pool www] child <pid> exited on signal 11 (SIGSEGV - core dumped) after <duration> seconds from start`.
   - Search for `(SIGSEGV)` because a message like this indicates that the core was not dumped: `WARNING: [pool www] child <pid> exited on signal 11 (SIGSEGV) after <duration> seconds from start`.
1. Locate the core dump by running `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`. The default value is typically `core`, meaning that a file named `core` will be generated in the web root folder.

If no core dump was generated, check the following configurations and change them as needed:

1. If `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` contains a path including nested directories, ensure the full directory path exists.
1. If the user running the PHP-FPM pool workers is something other than `root` (a common user name is `www-data`) give that user write permissions to the core dumps directory.
1. Ensure that the value of `/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable` is not `0`. Set it to `1` or `2` unless you run PHP-FPM workers pool as `root`. Check your options with your system administrator.
1. Ensure you have a suitable `rlimit_core` in the PHP-FPM pool configuration section. You can set it to unlimited: `rlimit_core = unlimited`.
1. Ensure you have a suitable `ulimit` set in your system. You can set it to unlimited: `ulimit -c unlimited`.
1. If your application runs in a Docker container, changes to `/proc/sys/*` have to be done to the host machine. Contact your system administrator to know the options available to you. If you are able to, try recreating the issue in your testing or staging environments.
