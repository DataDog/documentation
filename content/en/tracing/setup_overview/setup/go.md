## Compatibility requirements

The Go Tracer requires Go `1.12+` and Datadog Agent `>= 5.21.1`.  For a full list of supported libraries, visit the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Installation and getting started

For configuration instructions and details about using the API, see the Datadog [API documentation][2]. For manual instrumentation, use the [integrations section](#integrations) below for Go libraries and frameworks supporting automatic instrumentation.

For a description of the terminology used in APM, see the [Getting started with APM section][3]. For details about contributing, check the official repository [README.md][4].

Consult the [migration document][5] if you need to migrate from an older version of the tracer (e.g. v<0.6.x) to the newest version.

### Installation

#### Follow the in-app documentation (recommended)

Follow the [Quickstart instructions][6] within the Datadog app for the best experience, including:

- Step-by-step instructions scoped to your deployment configuration (hosts, Docker, Kubernetes, or Amazon ECS).
- Dynamically set `service`, `env`, and `version` tags.
- Enable the Continuous Profiler, ingesting 100% of traces , and Trace ID injection into logs during setup.


Otherwise, follow the instructions below to add the Datadog Tracing Library to your code.

## Automatic instrumentation

Datadog has a series of pluggable packages which provide out-of-the-box support for instrumenting a series of libraries and frameworks. A list of these packages can be found in the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.  To trace these integrations, import these packages into your application and follow the configuration instructions listed alongside each [Integration][1].

## Configuration

The Go tracer supports additional environment variables and functions for configuration.
See all available options in the [configuration documentation][7].

We highly recommend using `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION` to set `env`, `service`, and `version` for your services.
Check out the [Unified Service Tagging][8] documentation for recommendations on how to configure these environment variables. These variables are available for versions 1.24.0+ of the Go tracer.

You may also elect to provide `env`, `service`, and `version` through the tracer's API:

```go
package main

import (
    "gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer"
)

func main() {
    tracer.Start(
        tracer.WithEnv("prod"),
        tracer.WithService("test-go"),
        tracer.WithServiceVersion("abc123"),
    )

    // When the tracer is stopped, it will flush everything it has to the Datadog Agent before quitting.
    // Make sure this line stays in your main function.
    defer tracer.Stop()
}
```

### Configure the Datadog Agent for APM

Install and configure the Datadog Agent to receive traces from your now instrumented application. By default the Datadog Agent is enabled in your `datadog.yaml` file under `apm_config` with `enabled: true` and listens for trace traffic at `localhost:8126`. For containerized environments, follow the links below to enable trace collection within the Datadog Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Containers" %}}

1. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` in the `apm_config` section of your main [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][1].

2. See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

{{< partial name="apm/apm-containers.html" >}}
</br>

3. After having instrumented your application, the tracing client sends traces to `localhost:8126` by default.  If this is not the correct host and port change it by setting the below env variables:

    `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`.

    You can also set a custom hostname and port in code:

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "net"

        "gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer"
    )

    func main() {
        addr := net.JoinHostPort(
            "custom-hostname",
            "1234",
        )
        tracer.Start(tracer.WithAgentAddr(addr))
        defer tracer.Stop()
    }
    ```
{{< site-region region="us3,eu,gov" >}} 

4. Set `DD_SITE` in the Datadog Agent to {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} to ensure the Agent sends data to the right Datadog location.

{{< /site-region >}}

Tracing is available for a number of other environments, such as  [Heroku][1], [Cloud Foundry][2], [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][3], and [Azure App Services Extension][4].

For other environments, please refer to the [Integrations][5] documentation for that environment and [contact support][6] if you are encountering any setup issues.

## Configure APM environment name

The [APM environment name][9] may be configured [in the agent][10] or using the [WithEnv][7] start option of the tracer.

### B3 headers extraction and injection

The Datadog APM tracer supports [B3 headers extraction][11] and injection for distributed tracing.

Distributed headers injection and extraction is controlled by
configuring injection/extraction styles. Two styles are
supported: `Datadog` and `B3`.

Configure injection styles using the environment variable
`DD_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECT=Datadog,B3`

Configure extraction styles using the environment variable
`DD_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT=Datadog,B3`

The values of these environment variables are comma separated lists of
header styles that are enabled for injection or extraction. By default only
the `Datadog` extraction style is enabled.

If multiple extraction styles are enabled, extraction attempts are made
in the order that those styles are specified. The first successfully
extracted value is used.
