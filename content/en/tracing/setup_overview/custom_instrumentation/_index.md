Custom instrumentation allows programmatic creation, modification, or deletion of traces to send to Datadog. This is useful for tracing in-house code not captured by automatic instrumentation, removing unwanted spans from traces, as well as for providing deeper visibility and context into spans, including adding any desired [span tags][1].

Before instrumenting your application, review Datadog’s [APM Terminology][2] and familiarize yourself with the core concepts of Datadog APM.

If you’re already using OpenTracing or OpenTelemetry, see [OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry][3].
