### Integrations

#### Web framework compatibility

By default, Datadog **supports all PHP web frameworks** out of the box, with either framework-level instrumentation, or generic web tracing.

Framework-level instrumentation includes tracing of internal methods and framework specific tagging.

Generic web tracing includes a `web.request` span to track latency and errors that originated from the call, in addition to spans for supported libraries â€” for example: database and HTTP clients.

The following table enumerates some of the frameworks and versions Datadog successfully traces.

**Web frameworks**:

| Module         | Versions             | Support Type               | Instrumentation level           |

| CodeIgniter    | 2.x                  | PHP 7+                     | Framework-level instrumentation |
| CodeIgniter    | 3.x                  | PHP 7+                     | Generic web tracing             |
| Laravel        | 4.2, 5.x, 6.x        | All supported PHP versions | Framework-level instrumentation |

Note that even if you don't see your web framework in this list, it is supported out of the box with the latest release of the tracer.

Datadog is continuously adding more support for in-depth tracing for PHP web-frameworks.  To request support for additional span metadata and framework internals, contact our awesome [support team][2].

#### CLI library compatibility

Tracing from the CLI SAPI is disabled by default. To enable tracing of PHP CLI scripts, set `DD_TRACE_CLI_ENABLED=true`.

| Module          | Versions | Support Type    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|
| CakePHP Console | 2.x      | Fully Supported |
| Laravel Artisan | 5.x      | Fully Supported |

#### Deep call stacks on PHP 5

The call stack is limited on PHP 5. See the [deep call stack troubleshooting page][4] for more details.

### Generators

Instrumenting [generators][5] is not supported on PHP 5 and PHP 7.

### PCNTL

We do not offer support for tracing processes forked using [pcntl][6]. When a call to `pcntl_fork` is detected, we disable tracing in the forked process. The main process is still be traced.

If the application invokes `pcntl_unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER);` and the tracer is installed, the application will fatally crash. This happens because `unshare` with `CLONE_NEWUSER` requires the process [not to be threaded][7], while the PHP tracer uses a separate thread to send traces to the Datadog Agent without blocking the main process.
