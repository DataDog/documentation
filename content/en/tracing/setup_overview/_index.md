In most environments, configuring your application to send [traces][1] to Datadog involves two steps:

1. Configuring the Datadog Agent for APM.

2. Adding the Datadog Tracing Library to your code.

Traces are sent from your application instrumented with a Datadog Tracing Library to the Datadog Agent, and from the Datadog Agent to Datadog.

In containerized, serverless, or certain other environments, there may be APM-specific configurations required on both the Tracer and Agent to ensure that traces can be properly received, so ensure you have followed instructions for both components.

## For setup instructions, select your language:

To instrument an application written in a language that does not yet have official library support, see the list of [community tracing libraries][2].
