If you aren't using a [supported framework instrumentation][1], or you would like additional depth in your applicationâ€™s [traces][2], you may want to manually instrument your code.

Do this either using the Trace annotation for simple method call tracing, or with the OpenTracing API for complex tracing. Datadog's Trace annotation is provided by the [dd-trace-api dependency][3]

```java
import datadog.trace.api.Trace;

public class MyJob {
  @Trace(operationName = "job.exec", resourceName = "MyJob.process")
  public static void process() {
    // your method implementation here
  }
}
```
