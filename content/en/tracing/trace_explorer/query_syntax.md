## Search query

All search parameters are contained in the url of the page, which can be helpful for sharing your view.

### Search syntax

A query is composed of *terms* and *operators*.

There are two types of *terms*:

* **Span tag**: Enrichments of context related to the span. For instance, host or container tags describing the infrastructure the service is running on.
* **Span attribute**: Content of the span, collected with automatic or manual instrumentation in the application.
  
To combine multiple *terms* into a complex query, use any of the following boolean operators:

| **Operator** | **Description**                                                                                        | **Example**                  |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| `AND`        | **Intersection**: both terms are in the selected events (if nothing is added, AND is taken by default) | authentication AND failure   |
| `OR`         | **Union**: either terms is contained in the selected events                                            | authentication OR password   |
| `-`          | **Exclusion**: the following term is NOT in the event                                                  | authentication AND -password |

### Attribute search

To search on a specific span attribute you must add `@` at the beginning of the attribute key.

For instance, if you want to access a span with the following attribute below, you can use:

`@git.commit.sha:12345`

```json
  "git": {
    "commit": {
      "sha": "12345"
    },
    "repository": {
      "id": "github.com/datadog/datadog"
    }
  }
```
**Note:** You do not need to use `@` on the [reserved attributes][17]: `env`, `operation_name`, `resource_name`, `service`, `status`, `span_id`, `timestamp`, `trace_id`, `type`, `link`

### Tags search

Your spans inherit tags from hosts and integrations that generate them. They can be used in the search query:

| Query                                                          | Match                                                                       |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `("env:prod" OR test)`                                         | All traces with the tag `#env:prod` or the tag `#test`                      |
| `(service:srvA OR service:srvB)` or `(service:(srvA OR srvB))` | All traces that contain tags `#service:srvA` or `#service:srvB`.            |
| `("env:prod" AND -"version:beta")`                             | All traces that contain `#env:prod` and that do not contain `#version:beta` |

If your tags don't follow [tags best practices][2], then do not use `key:value` syntax. Instead, use the following search query:

* `tags:<MY_TAG>`

Example tag that does not follow the best practices:

<img width="867" alt="tagging-not-recommended" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a3d5246-b6e7-4ab2-908a-bc2137062573">

Search query for this specific tag:
`tags:"auto-discovery.cluster-autoscaler.k8s.io/daffy"`

### Wildcards

To perform a multi-character wildcard search, use the `*` symbol as follows:

* `service:web*`  matches every trace that has a services starting with `web`
* `@url:data*`  matches every trace that has a `url` starting with `data`.

### Numerical values

Use `<`,`>`, `<=`, or `>=` to perform a search on numerical attributes. For instance, retrieve all traces that have a response time over 100ms with:

`@http.response_time:>100`

It is also possible to search for numerical attributes within a specific range. For instance, retrieve all your 4xx errors with:

`@http.status_code:[400 TO 499]`

### Autocomplete

Typing a complex query can be cumbersome. Use the search bar's autocomplete feature to complete your query using existing values:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/search_bar_autocomplete.png" alt="search bar autocomplete " style="width:60%;">}}

### Escaping of special characters

The following attributes are considered as special: `?`, `>`, `<`, `:`, `=`,`"`, `~`, `/`, and `\` require escaping.
For instance, to search traces that contain `user=JaneDoe` in their `url` the following search must be entered:

`@url:*user\=JaneDoe*`

The same logic must be applied to spaces within trace attributes. It is not recommended to have spaces in trace attributes but in such cases, spaces require escaping.
If an attribute is called `user.first name`, perform a search on this attribute by escaping the space:

`@user.first\ name:myvalue`

### Saved searches

Don't lose time building the same views everyday. Saved searches contain your search query, columns, and time horizon. They are then available in the search bar thanks to the auto-complete matching whether the search name or query.

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/saved_search.png" alt="Saved Search" style="width:80%;">}}

To delete a saved search, click on the bin icon under the Trace search dropdown menu.

### Search for services and entities 

{{< site-region region="ap1,us3,us5,eu,us" >}}
To search for a service, use the `service` attribute. To search for another [entity type][20] (for example, a database, a queue, or a third-party provider), rely on other [peer attributes][21] which Datadog uses to describe dependencies that are not instrumented with APM. For instance, to find spans representing calls to a `users` table from a postgres database, use the following query: `@peer.db.name:users @peer.db.system:postgres`

**Note**: The span's `service` tag represents the service **emitting** the span if you migrated to the [global service naming][22] by setting `DD_TRACE_REMOVE_INTEGRATION_SERVICE_NAME_ENABLED=true`.

[20]: /tracing/services/inferred_services
[21]: /tracing/services/inferred_services#peer-tags
[22]: /tracing/services/inferred_services#migrate-to-global-default-service-naming
{{< /site-region >}}

## Time range

The time range allows you to display traces within a given time period. Quickly change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown menu (or [entering a custom time frame][3]):

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/time_frame2.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Select time frame" >}}

## Span table

The Span table is the list of spans that match the selected context. A context is defined by a [search bar](#search-bar) filter and a [time range](#time-range).

{{< site-region region="ap1,us3,us5,eu,us" >}}
### The service column

By default, the service column shows the `service` reserved attribute from the span.

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/span_table_service.png" style="width:60%;" alt="Span table service column" >}}

When the span represents a client call from an instrumented service to an inferred service, the service column shows:
- the **service**, identified by the `service` reserved attribute.
- the **[inferred service][4]**: name of the inferred entity being called by the base service, identified by one of the [peer attributes][5]

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/span_table_inferred_service.png" style="width:90%;" alt="Span table service column with inferred service" >}}

When the service name is an override from the base service name, the service column shows:
- the **[base service][2]**: service from which the span is emitted, identified by the `@base_service` attribute.
- the **[service override][3]**: service name, different from the base service name, set automatically in Datadog integrations or changed via the programmatic API. The service override is identified by the `service` reserved attribute.

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/span_table_service_override.png" style="width:80%;" alt="Span table service column with service override" >}}

### Displaying a full trace

Click on any span to see details about the associated trace:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/trace_in_tracestream.png" alt="Trace in tracestream" style="width:80%;">}}

### Columns

To add other [span tags or attributes][23] as columns to the list, click the **Options** button and select any dimension you want to add:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/trace_list_with_column.png" alt="Trace list with columns" style="width:80%;">}}

## Facets

A Facet displays all the distinct values of an attribute or a tag as well as provides some basic analytics such as the amount of traces represented. This is also a switch to filter your data.

Facets allow you to pivot or filter your datasets based on a given attribute. Examples Facets may include users, services, etc...

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/facets_demo.png" alt="Facets demo" style="width:80%;">}}

### Measures

Measures are the specific type of facets for quantitative values.

Use measures when you need to:
* Aggregate values from multiple traces. For example, create a measure on the number of rows in Cassandra and view the P95 or top-most referrers per sum of file size requested.
* Numerically compute the highest latency services for shopping cart values over $1000.
* Filter continuous values. For example, the size in bytes of each payload chunk of a video stream.

**Types**

Measures come with either a (long) integer or double value, for equivalent capabilities.

**Units**

Measures support units (time in seconds or size in bytes) for handling of orders of magnitude at query time and display time. Unit is a property of the measure itself, not of the field. For example, consider a duration measure in nanoseconds: you have a span tag from `service:A` where `duration:1000` stands for `1000 milliseconds`, and another span tags from `service:B` where `duration:500` stands for `500 microseconds`:
Scale duration into nanoseconds for all span tags flowing in with the arithmetic processor. Use a `*1000000` multiplier on span tags from `service:A`, and a `*1000` multiplier on span tags from `service:B`.
Use `duration:>20ms` (see search syntax for reference) to consistently query span tags from both services at once, and see an aggregated result of max one minute.

### Create a facet

To start using an attribute as a Facet or in the search, click on it and add it as a Facet:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/create_facet.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Create Facet" style="width:50%;">}}

After you create a new facet, it is available in the facet panel for filtering and basic analytics.

### Facet panel

Use Facets to filter on your Traces. The search bar and url automatically reflect your selections.

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/facet_panel.png" alt="Facet panel" style="width:30%;">}}

## Visualizations

Select an Analytics visualization type using the Analytic selector:

* [Timeseries](#timeseries)
* [Top List](#top-list)
* [Table](#table)

### Timeseries

Visualize the evolution of the `Duration` metric (or a facet unique count of values) over a selected time frame, and (optionally) split by an available facet.

The following timeseries Analytics shows the evolution of the **pc99** **duration** by steps of **5min** for each **Service**

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/analytics/timeserie_example.png" alt="timeserie example" style="width:90%;">}}

### Top list

Visualize the top values from a facet according to their `Duration` (or a facet unique count of values).

The following top list analytics shows the top **pc99** **duration** of **Service**:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/analytics/top_list_example.png" alt="top list example" style="width:90%;">}}

### Table

Visualize the top values from a facet according to a chosen [measure][9] (the first measure you choose in the list), and display the value of additional measures for elements appearing in this top list. Update the search query or investigate logs corresponding to either dimension.

* When there are multiple dimensions, the top values are determined according to the first dimension, then according to the second dimension within the top values of the first dimension, then according to the third dimension within the top values of the second dimension.
* When there are multiple measures, the top or bottom list is determined according to the first measure.
* The subtotal may differ from the actual sum of values in a group, since only a subset (top or bottom) is displayed. Events with a null or empty value for this dimension are not displayed as a sub-group.

**Note**: A table visualization used for one single measure and one single dimension is the same as a toplist, just with a different display.

The following Table Log Analytics shows the evolution of the **top Status Codes** according to their **Throughput**, along with the number of unique **Client IPs**, and over the last 15 minutes:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/analytics/trace_table_example.png" alt="top list example" style="width:90%;">}}

## Related traces

Select or click on a section of the graph to either zoom in the graph or see the list of [traces][10] corresponding to your selection:

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/analytics/view_traces.png" alt="view Traces" style="width:40%;">}}

## Export

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/analytics/export_button.png" alt="Export your analytics button" style="width:40%;">}}

Export your queries:

* To [monitor][11]
* To [dashboard][12]
* To [notebook][18]

You can also generate a new metric for the query.

**Note**: APM queries in dashboards and notebooks are based on all [indexed spans][14]. APM queries in monitors are based on spans indexed by [custom retention filters][19] only.
