Trace metrics are collected automatically for your services and resources and are retained for 15 months. The latency percentiles exist as individual timeseries. These percentiles are also available as a [Datadog Distribution Metric][1]. Instead of having a different metric for each percentile; and separate metrics for services, resources, or second primary tags; Datadog offers a simple metric:

- `trace.<SPAN_NAME>`:
  - *Prerequisite:* This metric exists for any APM service .
  - *Description:* Represents latency distributions for all services, resources and versions across different environments and second primary tags.
  - *Metric type:* [DISTRIBUTION][2]
  - *Tags:* `env`, `service`, `version`, `resource`, and [the second primary tag][3].

The APM Service and Resource pages use this metric type automatically. This means you can use these metrics to power your dashboards and monitors.

**What does this metric mean for me?**
- [Distribution metrics][1] offer new capabilities like precise percentile calculation over time periods (instead of a rollup function) and open the door for better visualizations and functionality in the future.

**How am I seeing a full history of this new metric?**
- Datadog stitches any existing query on the new metric to an equivalent query based on the long-existing latency metrics, so you do not have to create multiple queries.

**I'm seeing a change in the values of my latency, what is happening?**
- Datadog Distribution Metrics are powered by [DDSketch][4]. This includes a change from rank-error guarantees to relative error guarantees. As a result, all percentile estimate values are now guaranteed to be closer to the true percentile value.
- Specifically, you might expect to see a reduction in p99 values, where this difference is most noticeable. The new values are centered more closely on the precise p99 value.
- One thing to note is that the APM metric calculations are not exactly akin to a Datadog Distribution Custom Metric that would be calculated in-code. The calculation happens on the backend, so some differences may occur.

**Where are these new metrics available?**
- These metrics are fully available for US customers, and coming soon for EU customers.
- Distribution Metrics now power APM Service and Resource pages as Datadog rolls this out for more customers.
- Datadog has migrated all manual queries from dashboards and monitors to the new metrics automatically on your behalf, while retaining the existing metrics to support historical views.

**I'm using Terraform. What does this change mean for me?**
- The existing metrics are still around; your Terraform definitions are still in place and still work.
- To take advantage of the [better precision][4] offered by the new DDSketch-based metrics, change your Terraform definitions as shown in the following examples.

Percentiles before:
```
avg:trace.http.request.duration.by.resource_service.99p{service:foo, resource:abcdef1234}
avg:trace.sample_span.duration.by.datacenter_resource_service.75p{datacenter:production, service:bar, resource:ghijk5678}
```

Percentiles after:
```
p99:trace.http.request{service:foo, resource:abcdef1234}
p75:trace.sample_span{datacenter:production, service:bar, resource:ghijk5678}
```

p100 before:
```
avg:trace.http.request.duration.by.resource_service.100p{service:foo, resource:abcdef1234}
avg:trace.sample_span.duration.by.datacenter_resource_service.100p{datacenter:production, service:bar, resource:ghijk5678}
```
p100 after:
```
max:trace.http.request{service:foo, resource:abcdef1234}
max:trace.sample_span{datacenter:production, service:bar, resource:ghijk5678}
```
