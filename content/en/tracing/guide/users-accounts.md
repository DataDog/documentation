## Overview

Getting visibility into users and accounts in APM helps you understand which users are affected by performance issues or errors. User and account information is displayed in the [APM Investigator][8] and [Error Tracking issues][9]. Soon, this information will also be available in [service pages][13], [resource pages][14] and in the [trace panel][15].

{{< img src="tracing/guide/user-accounts/user-account-apm-investigator.png" alt="User and account information displayed in APM Investigator showing impacted users and accounts" style="width:100%;" >}}

By tagging traces with user and account identifiers, you can:
- Track which users are impacted by backend errors or latency issues
- Analyze performance split by user or account segments
- Monitor user-specific behaviors across your distributed systems

## Tag user and account information in spans

### From RUM

If you're already collecting Real User Monitoring data, you can propagate user and account information from browser or mobile applications to your backend traces:

1. Set user and account information using the [`datadogRum.setUser()`][1] and [`datadogRum.setAccount()`][2] APIs in your browser application.

2. Enable trace propagation by configuring `allowedTracingUrls` in your RUM SDK initialization. See [Connect RUM and Traces][3] for detailed setup instructions. Additionally, set `propagateTraceBaggage` to `true`, to automatically propagates user and account context in the [baggage][10] to backend traces alongside the trace context.

The user and account information is automatically remapped in the backend to the [`usr.id` and `account.id` standard attributes][4], making it consistent across all your traces. Standard attributes allow you to filter and search your trace data consistently across all your services.

### From APM SDKs

For backend services or applications without RUM, you can tag spans directly using APM SDKs:

1. Use the [span tagging API][5] (`set_tag`, `SetTag`, or `setTag` depending on your language) to add `usr.id` and `account.id` attributes to your spans.

2. To propagate user and account information across service boundaries, use [trace context propagation with baggage][6].

**Example (Python):**

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

# Tag the span with user and account information
span = tracer.current_span()
span.set_tag("usr.id", "user_123")
span.set_tag("account.id", "account_456")

# Set baggage to propagate across service boundaries
span.context.set_baggage_item("user.id", "user_123")
span.context.set_baggage_item("account.id", "account_456")
```

**Note**: When propagating user and account information through baggage, this information is currently only tagged on [service entry spans][11]. This means the `usr.id` and `account.id` attributes appear on the first span of each service in your distributed trace.

## Query trace data with user and account information

With user and account IDs tagged on spans throughout your distributed traces, this enables powerful analysis capabilities, bringing you visiblility onto how backend errors and latency affect end-users.

With [Product Analytics User and Account Profiles][7], you will soon be able to query span data by richer user and account attributes, providing even deeper insights into how your application performs for different user segments. [Reach out to support][12] to express interest in this.

#### Filter traces by user or account in the APM Trace Explorer

Query traces using the `usr.id` or `account.id` attributes:

- Search for all traces from a specific user or account: `@usr.id:user_123` / `@account.id:account_456`
- Combine with other filters: `@usr.id:user_123 service:checkout status:error`

This allows you to quickly investigate issues affecting specific users or accounts and understand their end-to-end experience across your distributed system.

#### Identify which users or accounts are most affected by errors or latency

Analyze error patterns and latency issues across your user base to prioritize fixes based on business impact:

- Use [Tag Analysis][17] to identify which users or accounts are disproportionately affected by errors or high latency on backend services
- [Group queries][18] by by `usr.id` or `account.id` to analyse error rates or latency percentiles by user or account.
- View user and account impact directly in the [APM Investigator][8] and [Error Tracking issues][9] to understand the scope of production problems.

This helps you prioritize incident response based on the number of affected users or the importance of affected accounts.

#### Create monitors and alerts based on user or account segments

Set up [APM monitors][19] that alert you when specific user segments experience degraded performance:

- Create error rate monitors filtered by premium account tiers: `@account.id:premium_* status:error`
- Alert on latency spikes for critical users: `@usr.id:vip_user_* @duration:>5s`
- Monitor SLA compliance for enterprise accounts by setting monitors on specific account IDs

This enables proactive monitoring and ensures you can respond quickly when high-value users or accounts experience issues.
