Code Origins is currently in Preview. To participate in the preview, simply follow the set up instructions below. 

To submit questions, feedback, or requests related to Code Origins, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyeRsF2GJjYdf9bUyeDjt8_9id-gvqiBU1SHR3ioDGe5eF3g/viewform?usp=header">fill out this form</a> with as much detail as possible. 

For urgent issues, please contact <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/support/">Datadog support</a>.

## Overview

Code Origins captures the exact location in your codebase where APM spans are created. When enabled, it automatically adds file path, line number, and function name to each span, making it easier to:

- Debug performance issues
- Understand code execution flow
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Onboard new team members

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Datadog APM][6] configured to capture spans
- Service meets the [Compatibility Requirements](#compatibility-requirements) below
- [Source Code Integration][7] enabled (recommended for code previews)

### Compatibility requirements

| Runtime Language | Tracing Library Version | Frameworks |
|---|---|---|
| Java | `1.47.0` or later | Spring Boot/Data, gRPC servers, Micronaut 4, Kafka consumers (entry spans only)|
| Python | `2.15.0` or later | Django, Flask, Starlette and derivatives (entry & exit spans)|
| Node.js | `4.49.0` or later | Fastify (entry & exit spans), All other [APM-supported integrations][8] ( exit spans only)|
| .NET | `3.15.0` or later | ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core (entry & exit spans)| 

### Enable Code Origins

Run your service with the below environment variable:

```shell
export DD_CODE_ORIGIN_FOR_SPANS_ENABLED=true
```

## Using Code Origins

### In the Trace Explorer

1. Navigate to the [Trace Explorer][1].
2. Click on any trace to view its details.
3. In the span details panel, look for the "Code Origin" section.
4. Optionally, click on variables referenced the source code to add them as attributes on future spans using [Dynamic Instrumentation][5].
5. (Coming Soon) Click on "Start Debug Session" to open Live Debugger and begin capturing logs at this code location in real-time.

### In your IDE

1. Set up your [Datadog IDE Integration][4].
2. See RED metrics as code annotations above your endpoint methods.
3. Quickly navigate to the code location of a given APM span visible from your IDE.

## How it works

Code Origins captures two types of spans:

**Entry spans**: Shows the first method in your application code that handles an incoming request. The APM integration identifies the source code location where requests enter your system.

**Exit spans**: Shows the exact line of code that makes an outgoing request to a downstream service. The tracer examines the call stack to identify the line where an exit span starts, skipping third-party code.

<div class="alert alert-info">Note: Some tracing libraries may have slightly different implementations to optimize for performance.</div>

## Impact on performance and billing

**Performance Impact**: Code Origins has negligible performance overhead that is virtually unnoticeable in production environments.

**Pricing Impact**: While in Preview, Code Origins will have no additional impact on billing.

## Troubleshooting

If Code Origin information is missing:

1. Verify Code Origins is enabled in your tracing library configuration
2. Check that your service meets all [Compatibility Requirements](#compatibility-requirements)
3. Check the service language and framework support for capturing Code Origins on entry and/or exit spans
4. Filter spans with Code Origins in the Traces explorer using the search query: `@_dd.code_origin.type:*`
5. Code Origins does not capture third-party code
6. Enable [Source Code Integration][7] to see code previews in the APM Trace details
