Import the [`opentracer` package][1] to expose the Datadog tracer as an [OpenTracing][2] compatible tracer.

A basic usage example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go"

    "gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/opentracer"
    "gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer"
)

func main() {
    // Start the regular tracer and return it as an opentracing.Tracer interface. You
    // may use the same set of options as you normally would with the Datadog tracer.
    t := opentracer.New(tracer.WithServiceName("<SERVICE_NAME>"))

    // Stop it using the regular Stop call for the tracer package.
    defer tracer.Stop()

    // Set the global OpenTracing tracer.
    opentracing.SetGlobalTracer(t)

    // Use the OpenTracing API as usual.
}
```

**Note**: Using the [OpenTracing API][3] in parallel with the regular API or Datadog integrations is fully supported. Under the hood, all of them make use of the same tracer. See the [API documentation][1] for more examples and details.
