Generate custom metrics from ingested spans to track trends, power dashboards, and trigger monitorsâ€”even for spans that are not retained for full trace analysis.

Span-based metrics are created from spans that have been ingested by Datadog APM, regardless of whether those spans are indexed by a [retention filter][1]. These metrics allow you to extract numeric values (such as counts, durations, or custom tags) from spans and store them as long-lived [custom metrics][3] with a 15-month retention period.

**Note:** The set of spans available for metric generation depends on your [APM ingestion control settings][12]. Spans dropped due to sampling or filtering are not ingested, and therefore cannot be used to generate metrics.

Use span-based metrics when you:
- Need long-term visibility into span-level patterns, such as request volume, latency, or error rates
- Want to power [anomaly][4] or [forecast][7] monitors with low-latency, high-resolution metrics
- Don't need to retain the full trace, but want to extract key signals for trending or alerting

<span class="alert alert-warning">Span-based metrics are considered <a href="/metrics/custom_metrics/">custom metrics</a> and are billed accordingly. To avoid high costs, do not group metrics by high-cardinality values such as user IDs or request IDs.</span>


## Create a span-based metric

{{< img src="tracing/span_to_metrics/createspantometrics.png" style="width:100%;" alt="How to create a metric" >}}

1. **Define the metric query:** Start by adding a query for filtering to your required dataset. The [query syntax][10] is the same as APM Search and Analytics.

1. **Define the field you want to track:** Select `*` to generate a count of all spans matching your query or enter an attribute (for example, `@cassandra_row_count`) to aggregate a numeric value and create its corresponding count, minimum, maximum, sum, and average aggregated metrics. If the attribute type is a measure, the value of the metric is the value of the span attribute.

   **Note**: Span attributes that are not numerical values cannot be used for aggregation. To generate a metric that counts the distinct values of a span attribute (for instance count the number of user IDs hitting a specific endpoint), add this dimension to the `group by` selector, and use the `count_nonzero` function to count the number of tag values.

1. **Specify the group-by dimension:** By default, metrics generated from spans will not have any tags unless explicitly added. Any attribute or tag that exists in your spans can be used to create metric tags.

1. **Check the Live Analytics and Search Query preview:** You can view the impact of your query in real-time on the data visualization, and the matching spans considered for your query in a live preview.

1. **Name your metric:** Metric names must follow the [metric naming convention][11]. Metric names that start with `trace.*` are not permitted and will not be saved.

<div class="alert alert-warning"> Span-based metrics are considered <a href="/metrics/custom_metrics/">custom metrics</a> and billed accordingly. Avoid grouping by unbounded or extremely high cardinality attributes like timestamps, user IDs, request IDs, or session IDs to avoid impacting your billing.</div>

## Update existing span-based metrics

After a metric is created, only two fields can be updated:

| Field                                 | Reason                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stream filter query                  | Change the set of matching spans to be aggregated into metrics.            |
| Aggregation groups             | Update the tags to manage the cardinality of generated metrics.                                                     |

**Note**: To change the metric type or name, create a new metric and delete the old one.
