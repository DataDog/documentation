## Code Level Metrics to Dashboards

{{< img src="tracing/profiling/profiling-metric-dashboard.gif" alt="Add profiling metrics to your dashboards.">}}

You can obtain key profiling metrics from services such as top CPU usage by method, top memory allocations by thread, and CPU usage by version to visualize in your dashboards and alert with monitors.

## Code Level Metrics on Service Pages

{{< img src="tracing/profiling/service-page-metrics.png" alt="Automatically access profiling metrics on your service pages.">}}

Alongside latency, error rates, and request metrics, you will also have code level metrics automatically added to your out of the box service pages.
