## Compatibilty Requirements

For a full list of supported libraries and language versions, visit the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Installation and Getting Started

If you already have a Datadog account you can find [step-by-step instructions][2] in our in-app guides for either host-based or container-based set ups.

For descriptions of terminology used in APM, take a look at the [official documentation][3].

For details about open-source contributions to the PHP tracer, refer to the [contributing guide][4].

### Setup the Datadog Agent

The PHP APM tracer sends trace data through the Datadog Agent.

[Install and configure the Datadog Agent][5]. See the additional documentation for [tracing Docker applications][6] or [Kubernetes applications][7].

For Agent version [7.18.0][8] and above, APM is enabled by default for all environments without further action.
If you are running an older version of the agent, make sure the Agent has **[APM enabled][5]**.

### Install the extension

Install the PHP extension using one of the [precompiled packages for supported distributions][9].

Once downloaded, install the package with one of the commands below.

```shell
# using RPM package (RHEL/Centos 6+, Fedora 20+)
rpm -ivh datadog-php-tracer.rpm

# using DEB package (Debian Jessie+ , Ubuntu 14.04+ on supported PHP versions)
dpkg -i datadog-php-tracer.deb

# using APK package (Alpine)
apk add datadog-php-tracer.apk --allow-untrusted
```

The extension will be installed for the default PHP version. To install the extension for a specific PHP version, use the `DD_TRACE_PHP_BIN` environment variable to set the location of the target PHP binary before installing.

```shell
export DD_TRACE_PHP_BIN=$(which php-fpm7)
```

Restart PHP (PHP-FPM or the Apache SAPI) and then visit a tracing-enabled endpoint of your application. View the [APM UI][10] to see the traces.

**Note**: It might take a few minutes before traces appear in the UI. If traces still do not appear after a few minutes, [run the dd-doctor.php diagnostic script][11] from the host machine to help identify any issues.

If you can't find your distribution, you can [manually install][12] the PHP extension.

## Automatic Instrumentation

Tracing is automatically enabled by default. Once the extension is installed, **ddtrace** traces your application and sends traces to the Agent.

Datadog supports all web frameworks out of the box. Automatic instrumentation works by modifying PHP's runtime to wrap certain functions and methods to trace them. The PHP tracer supports automatic instrumentation for [several libraries](#library-compatibility).

Automatic instrumentation captures:

* Method execution time
* Relevant trace data, such as URL and status response codes for web requests or SQL queries for database access
* Unhandled exceptions, including stacktraces if available
* A total count of traces (e.g., web requests) flowing through the system

**Note**: If your application does not use Composer nor an autoloader registered with `spl_autoload_register()`, set the environment variable, `DD_TRACE_NO_AUTOLOADER=true`, to enable automatic instrumentation.

## Change Agent Hostname

Configure your application level tracers to submit traces to a custom Agent hostname:

The PHP tracer automatically looks for and initializes with the ENV variables `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`.

See [tracer configuration][13] for more information on how to set these variables.

## Configuration

The PHP tracer can be configured using environment variables.

**Note**: If you use code auto-instrumentation (the recommended approach) be aware that the instrumenting code is executed before any user code. As a result, the environment variables below must be set at the server level and be available to the PHP runtime before any user code is executed. For example, `putenv()` and `.env` files would not work.

### Apache

For Apache with php-fpm, use the `env` directory in your `www.conf` configuration file to configure the php tracer, for example:

```
; Example of passing the host environment variable SOME_ENV
; to the PHP process as DD_AGENT_HOST
env[DD_AGENT_HOST] = $SOME_ENV
; Example of passing the value 'my-app' to the PHP
; process as DD_SERVICE
env[DD_SERVICE] = my-app
```

Alternatively, you can use [`SetEnv`][14] from the server config, virtual host, directory, or `.htaccess` file.

```text
SetEnv DD_TRACE_DEBUG true
```

### NGINX

For NGINX, use the `env` directive in the php-fpm's `www.conf` file, for example:

```
; Example of passing the host environment variable SOME_ENV
; to the PHP process as DD_AGENT_HOST
env[DD_AGENT_HOST] = $SOME_ENV
; Example of passing the value 'my-app' to the PHP
; process as DD_SERVICE
env[DD_SERVICE] = my-app
```

**Note**: If you have enabled APM for your NGINX server, make sure you have properly configured the `opentracing_fastcgi_propagate_context` setting for distributed tracing to properly work. See [NGINX APM configuration][15] for more details.

### PHP CLI server

Set in the command line to start the server.

```text
DD_TRACE_DEBUG=true php -S localhost:8888
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

#### Integration names

The table below specifies the default service names for each integration. Change the service names with `DD_SERVICE_MAPPING`.

Use the name when setting integration-specific configuration such as, `DD_TRACE_<INTEGRATION>_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, for example: Laravel is `DD_TRACE_LARAVEL_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`.

| Integration       | Service Name      |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| CakePHP           | `cakephp`         |
| CodeIgniter       | `codeigniter`     |

#### Map resource names to normalized URI

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Deprecation notice:</strong> As of version <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/tag/0.47.0">0.47.0</a> the legacy setting <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING</code> is deprecated. It still works for the foreseeable future but it is strongly encouraged that you use the new settings outlined in this paragraph to avoid issues when legacy support is removed.

Note that setting any of the following: <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX</code>, <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING</code>, and <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING</code> will opt-in to the new resource normalization approach and any value in <code>DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING</code> will be ignored.
</div>

For HTTP server and client integrations, the URL is used to form the trace resource name in the format `<HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD> <NORMALIZED_URL>`, with the query string removed from the URL. This allows better visibility in any custom framework that is not automatically instrumented by normalizing the URLs and grouping together generic endpoints under one resource.

| HTTP Request                       | Resource Name |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------|
| **GET** request to `/foo?a=1&b=2`  | `GET /foo`    |
| **POST** request to `/bar?foo=bar` | `POST /bar`   |

Numeric IDs, UUIDs (with and without dashes), and 32-to-512-bit hexadecimal hashes are automatically replaced with a `?` character.

| URL (GET request)                              | Resource Name      |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `/user/123/show`                               | `GET /user/?/show` |
| `/widget/b7a992e0-3300-4030-8617-84553b11c993` | `GET /widget/?`    |
| `/api/v2/b7a992e033004030861784553b11c993/123` | `GET /api/v2/?/?`  |
| `/book/0dbf3596`                               | `GET /book/?`      |

You can turn this functionality OFF using `DD_TRACE_URL_AS_RESOURCE_NAMES_ENABLED=false`.

##### Custom URL-To-Resource Mapping

There are a few cases that are not covered by the automatic normalization that is applied.

| URL (GET request)                | Expected Resource Name        |
|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| `/using/prefix/id123/for/id`    | `GET /using/prefix/?/for/id`  |
| `/articles/slug-of-title`        | `GET /articles/?`             |
| `/cities/new-york/rivers`        | `GET /cities/?/rivers`        |
| `/nested/cities/new-york/rivers` | `GET /nested/cities/?/rivers` |

There are two classes of scenarios that are not covered by automatic normalization:

  - The path fragment to normalize has a reproducible patter nand can be present in any part of the url, for example `id<number>` in the example above. This scenario is covered by the setting `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX` below.
  - The path fragment can be anything, and the previous path fragment indicates that a value has to be normalized. For example `/cities/new-york` tells us that `new-york` has to be normalized as it is the name of a city. This scenario is covered by settings `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING` and `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING` for incoming and outgoing requests respectively.

###### `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX`

This setting is a CSV of regex that are applied to every path fragment independently. For example setting `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_FRAGMENT_REGEX` to `^id\d+$` for the first example `/using/prefix/id123/for/id` would apply the regex to all framents `using`, `prefix`, `id123`, `for`, and `id`. The final normalized resorce name would be `GET /using/prefix/?/for/id`.

Note that multiple regular expressions separated by a comma can be added `^id\d+$,code\d+$` and that the comma character `,` is not escaped, hence it cannot be used in the regular expression.

###### `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING` and `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING`

This setting is a CSV of patterns that can contain a wildcard `*`. For example, adding the pattern `cities/*` means that everytime the fragment `cities` is found while analyzing a URL, then the next fragment, if any, will be replaced with `?`. Patterns are applied at any depth, so applying the following rule will both normalize `/cities/new-york` and `/nested/cities/new-york` in the table above.

Patterns can be applied to a part of a specific fragment. For example `path/*-fix` would normalize the url `/some/path/changing-fix/nested` to `/some/path/?-fix/nested`

Note that `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_INCOMING` applies to only incoming requests (for example web frameworks) while `DD_TRACE_RESOURCE_URI_MAPPING_OUTGOING` only applies to outgoing requests (for example `curl` and `guzzle` requests).

## Upgrading

To upgrade the PHP tracer, [download the latest release][9] and follow the same steps as [installing the extension](#install-the-extension).

**Note**: If you are using second level caching in OPcache by setting the parameter `opcache.file_cache`, remove the cache folder.

## Removing

To remove the PHP tracer:

1. For php-fpm, stop the php-fpm service, otherwise stop the Apache web server.
2. Unlink files `98-ddtrace.ini` and `99-ddtrace-custom.ini` from your php configuration folder.
3. For php-fpm, restart php-fpm service, otherwise restart the Apache web server.

**Note**: If you are using second level caching in OPcache by setting the parameter `opcache.file_cache`, remove the cache folder.
