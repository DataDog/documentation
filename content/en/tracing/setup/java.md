## Installation and Getting Started

To begin tracing applications written in any language, first [install and configure the Datadog Agent][1], see the additional documentation for [tracing Docker applications][2] or [Kubernetes applications][3].

Next, download `dd-java-agent.jar` that contains the Agent class files:

```shell
wget -O dd-java-agent.jar 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.datadoghq&a=dd-java-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Finally, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, Maven or Gradle application script, or `java -jar` command:

```
-javaagent:/path/to/the/dd-java-agent.jar
```

Note that `dd-trace-java`'s artifacts (`dd-java-agent.jar`, `dd-trace-api.jar`, `dd-trace-ot.jar`) support all JVM-based languages, i.e. Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure, etc. If you need support for a particular framework, consider making an [open-source contribution][4].

## Automatic Instrumentation

Automatic instrumentation for Java uses the `java-agent` instrumentation capabilities [provided by the JVM][5]. When a `java-agent` is registered, it has the ability to modify class files at load time.
The `java-agent` uses the [Byte Buddy framework][6] to find the classes defined for instrumentation and modify those class bytes accordingly.

Instrumentation may come from auto-instrumentation, the OpenTracing api, or a mixture of both. Instrumentation generally captures the following info:

* Timing duration is captured using the JVM's nanotime clock unless a timestamp is provided from the OpenTracing api
* Key/value tag pairs
* Errors and stacktraces which are unhandled by the application
* A total count of traces (requests) flowing through the system

## Compatibility

Datadog officially supports the Java JRE 1.7 and higher of both Oracle JDK and OpenJDK. Datadog does not officially support any early-access versions of Java.

### Integrations

Most integrations are enabled by default. The following setting can change the default to disabled.

* System Property: `-Ddd.integrations.enabled=false`
* Environment Variable: `DD_INTEGRATIONS_ENABLED=false`

Integrations can be enabled or disabled individually (overriding the default above).

* System Property: `-Ddd.integration.<integration-name>.enabled=true`
* Environment Variable: `DD_INTEGRATION_<INTEGRATION_NAME>_ENABLED=true`

(See below for each integration's name.)

Beta integrations are disabled by default but can be enabled individually.

#### Web Framework Compatibility

`dd-java-agent` includes support for automatically tracing the following web frameworks.

| Server                       | Versions   | Support Type    | Instrumentation Names (used for configuration) |

| Spark Java                   | 2.3+       | [Beta][7]       | `sparkjava` (requires `jetty`)                 |
| Spring Web (MVC)             | 4.0+       | Fully Supported | `spring-web`                                   |

**Web Framework tracing provides:** timing HTTP request to response, tags for the HTTP request (status code, method, etc), error and stacktrace capturing, linking work created within a web request and Distributed Tracing.

*Note:* Many application servers are Servlet compatible and are automatically covered by that instrumentation, such as Tomcat, Jetty, Websphere, Weblogic, etc.
Also, frameworks like Spring Boot inherently work because it uses a Servlet compatible embedded application server.

To improve visibility into applications using unsupported frameworks, consider:

* Adding custom instrumentation (with OpenTracing or the `@Trace` annotation).
* [Submitting a pull request][9] with instrumentation for inclusion in a future release.
* Contacting [Datadog support][8] and submitting a feature request.

**Note**:

* If the same key type is set for both, the system property configuration takes priority.
* System properties can be used as JVM parameters.

### B3 Headers Extraction and Injection

Datadog APM tracer supports [B3 headers extraction][10] and injection for
distributed tracing.

Distributed headers injection and extraction is controlled by
configuring injection/extraction styles. Currently two styles are
supported:

* Datadog: `Datadog`
* B3: `B3`

Injection styles can be configured using:

* System Property: `-Ddd.propagation.style.inject=Datadog,B3`
* Environment Variable: `DD_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECTION=Datadog,B3`

The value of the property or environment variable is a comma (or
space) separated list of header styles that are enabled for
injection. By default only Datadog injection style is enabled.

Extraction styles can be configured using:

* System Property: `-Ddd.propagation.style.extract=Datadog,B3`
* Environment Variable: `DD_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT=Datadog,B3`

The value of the property or environment variable is a comma (or
space) separated list of header styles that are enabled for
extraction. By default only Datadog extraction style is enabled.

If multiple extraction styles are enabled extraction attempt is done
on the order those styles are configured and first successful
extracted value is used.


## Trace Reporting

To report a trace to Datadog the following happens:

* Trace completes
* Trace is pushed to an asynchronous queue of traces
  * Queue is size-bound and doesn't grow past a set limit of 7000 traces
  * Once the size limit is reached, traces are discarded
  * A count of the total traces is captured to ensure accurate throughput
* In a separate reporting thread, the trace queue is flushed and traces are encoded via msgpack then sent to the Datadog Agent via http
* Queue flushing happens on a schedule of once per second

To see the actual code, documentation, and usage examples for any of the
libraries and frameworks that Datadog supports, check the full list of auto-
instrumented components for Java applications in the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

### Trace Annotation

Add the `dd-trace-api` dependency to your project. For Maven, add this to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.datadoghq</groupId>
    <artifactId>dd-trace-api</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add:

```gradle
compile group: 'com.datadoghq', name: 'dd-trace-api', version: {version}
```

Now add `@Trace` to methods to have them be traced when running with `dd-java-agent.jar`.  If the Agent is not attached, this annotation has no effect on your application.

## Performance

Java APM has minimal impact on the overhead of an application:

* No collections maintained by Java APM grow unbounded in memory
* Reporting traces does not block the application thread
* Java APM typically adds no more than a 3% increase in CPU usage
* Java APM typically adds no more than a 3% increase in JVM heap usage

## Change Agent Hostname

Configure your application level tracers to submit traces to a custom Agent hostname:

The Java Tracing Module automatically looks for and initializes with the ENV variables `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`.

```bash
java -javaagent:<DD-JAVA-AGENT-PATH>.jar -jar <YOUR_APPLICATION_PATH>.jar
```

You can also use system properties:

```bash
java -javaagent:<DD-JAVA-AGENT-PATH>.jar \
     -Ddd.agent.host=$DD_AGENT_HOST \
     -Ddd.agent.port=$DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT \
     -jar <YOUR_APPLICATION_PATH>.jar
```
