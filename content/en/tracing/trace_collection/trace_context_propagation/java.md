Datadog APM tracer supports [B3 headers extraction][8] and injection for distributed tracing.

Distributed headers injection and extraction is controlled by configuring injection/extraction styles. Currently two styles are supported:

- Datadog: `Datadog`
- B3: `B3`

Injection styles can be configured using:

- System Property: `-Ddd.propagation.style.inject=Datadog,B3`
- Environment Variable: `DD_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECT=Datadog,B3`

The value of the property or environment variable is a comma (or space) separated list of header styles that are enabled for injection. By default only Datadog injection style is enabled.

Extraction styles can be configured using:

- System Property: `-Ddd.propagation.style.extract=Datadog,B3`
- Environment Variable: `DD_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT=Datadog,B3`

The value of the property or environment variable is a comma (or space) separated list of header styles that are enabled for extraction. By default only Datadog extraction style is enabled.

If multiple extraction styles are enabled extraction attempt is done on the order those styles are configured and first successful extracted value is used.
