### Headers extraction and injection

Datadog APM tracer supports [B3][6] and [W3C Trace Context][7] header extraction and injection for distributed tracing.

Distributed headers injection and extraction is controlled by configuring injection and extraction styles. The following styles are supported:

- Datadog: `Datadog`
- B3 Multi Header: `b3multi`
- B3 Single Header: `b3`
- W3C Trace Context: `tracecontext`
- No-op: `none`

Injection styles can be configured using:

- Environment Variable: `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECT=Datadog,b3`

The value of the environment variable is a comma-separated list of header styles that are enabled for injection. The default setting is `datadog,tracecontext`.

Extraction styles can be configured using:

- Environment Variable: `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT=Datadog,b3`

The value of the environment variable is a comma-separated list of header styles that are enabled for extraction. The default setting is `datadog,tracecontext`.

If multiple extraction styles are enabled extraction attempt is done on the order those styles are configured and first successful extracted value is used.

The default extraction styles are, in order, `Datadog`, `b3multi`, `b3`, and `tracecontext`.

You can also enable or disable the use of these formats in code by using `Datadog.configure`:

```ruby
Datadog.configure do |c|
  # List of header formats that should be extracted
  c.tracing.distributed_tracing.propagation_extract_style = [ 'tracecontext', 'Datadog', 'b3' ]

  # List of header formats that should be injected
  c.tracing.distributed_tracing.propagation_inject_style = [ 'tracecontext', 'Datadog' ]
end
```

For more information about trace context propagation configuration, read [the Distributed Tracing section][1] in the Ruby Tracing Library Configuration docs.
