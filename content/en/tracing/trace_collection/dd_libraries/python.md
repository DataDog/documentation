## Compatibility requirements
The latest Python Tracer supports CPython versions 2.7 and 3.5-3.10.

For a full list of Datadogâ€™s Python version and framework support (including legacy and maintenance versions), read the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Installation and getting started

### Follow the in-app documentation (recommended)

Follow the [Quickstart instructions][2] within the Datadog app for the best experience, including:

- Step-by-step instructions scoped to your deployment configuration (hosts, Docker, Kubernetes, or Amazon ECS).
- Dynamically set `service`, `env`, and `version` tags.
- Enable the Continuous Profiler, ingesting 100% of traces, and Trace ID injection into logs during setup.

### Configure the Datadog Agent for APM

Install and configure the Datadog Agent to receive traces from your now instrumented application. By default the Datadog Agent is enabled in your `datadog.yaml` file under `apm_config` with `enabled: true` and listens for trace data by default at `http://localhost:8126`. For containerized environments, follow the links below to enable trace collection within the Datadog Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Containers" %}}

1. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` in the `apm_config` section of your main [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][1].

2. See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

{{< partial name="apm/apm-containers.html" >}}
</br>

3. After the application is instrumented, the trace client attempts to send traces to the Unix domain socket `/var/run/datadog/apm.socket` by default. If the socket does not exist, traces are sent to `http://localhost:8126`.

   If a different socket, host, or port is required, use the `DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL` environment variable. Some examples:

   ```
   DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL=http://custom-hostname:1234
   DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL=unix:///var/run/datadog/apm.socket
   ```

   The connection for traces can also be configured in code:

   ```python
   from ddtrace import tracer

   # Network sockets
   tracer.configure(
       https=False,
       hostname="custom-hostname",
       port="1234",
   )

   # Unix domain socket configuration
   tracer.configure(
       uds_path="/var/run/datadog/apm.socket",
   )
   ```

   Similarly, the trace client attempts to send stats to the `/var/run/datadog/dsd.socket` Unix domain socket. If the socket does not exist then stats are sent to `http://localhost:8125`.

   If a different configuration is required, the `DD_DOGSTATSD_URL` environment variable can be used. Some examples:
   ```
   DD_DOGSTATSD_URL=udp://custom-hostname:1234
   DD_DOGSTATSD_URL=unix:///var/run/datadog/dsd.socket
   ```
   The connection for stats can also be configured in code:

   ```python
   from ddtrace import tracer

   # Network socket
   tracer.configure(
     dogstatsd_url="udp://localhost:8125",
   )

   # Unix domain socket configuration
   tracer.configure(
     dogstatsd_url="unix:///var/run/datadog/dsd.socket",
   )
   ```

4. Set `DD_SITE` in the Datadog Agent to {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} to ensure the Agent sends data to the right Datadog location.

Tracing is available for a number of other environments, such as  [Heroku][1], [Cloud Foundry][2], [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][3], and [Azure App Service][4].

For other environments, please refer to the [Integrations][5] documentation for that environment and [contact support][6] if you are encountering any setup issues.

### Instrument Your Application

Once the agent is installed, to begin tracing applications written in Python, install the Datadog Tracing library, `ddtrace`, using pip:

```python
pip install ddtrace
```

**Note:** This command requires pip version `18.0.0` or greater.  For Ubuntu, Debian, or another package manager, update your pip version with the following command:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then to instrument your Python application use the included `ddtrace-run` command. To use it, prefix your Python entry-point command with `ddtrace-run`.

For example, if your application is started with `python app.py` then:

```shell
ddtrace-run python app.py
```

Once you've finished setup and are running the tracer with your application, you can run `ddtrace-run --info` to check that configurations are working as expected. Note that the output from this command does not reflect configuration changes made during runtime in code.

## Configuration

If needed, configure the tracing library to send application performance telemetry data as you require, including setting up Unified Service Tagging. Read [Library Configuration][5] for details.

### Upgrading to v1

If you are upgrading to ddtrace v1, review the [upgrade guide][3] and the [release notes][4] in the library documentation for full details.
