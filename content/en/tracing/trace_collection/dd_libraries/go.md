## Compatibility requirements

The Go Tracer requires Go `1.17+` and Datadog Agent `>= 5.21.1`. For a full list of Datadogâ€™s Go version and framework support (including legacy and maintenance versions), see the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Installation and getting started

### Follow the in-app documentation (recommended)

Follow the [Quickstart instructions][2] within the Datadog app for the best experience, including:

- Step-by-step instructions scoped to your deployment configuration (hosts, Docker, Kubernetes, or Amazon ECS).
- Dynamically set `service`, `env`, and `version` tags.
- Enable the Continuous Profiler, ingesting 100% of traces , and Trace ID injection into logs during setup.

Otherwise, follow the instructions below to add the Datadog Tracing Library to your code and to initiate the Go integration.

### Configure the Datadog Agent for APM

Install and configure the Datadog Agent to receive traces from your now instrumented application. By default the Datadog Agent is enabled in your `datadog.yaml` file under `apm_config` with `enabled: true` and listens for trace traffic at `localhost:8126`. For containerized environments, follow the links below to enable trace collection within the Datadog Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Containers" %}}

1. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` in the `apm_config` section of your main [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][1].

2. See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

{{< partial name="apm/apm-containers.html" >}}
</br>

3. After the application is instrumented, the trace client attempts to send traces to the Unix domain socket `/var/run/datadog/apm.socket` by default. If the socket does not exist, traces are sent to `http://localhost:8126`.

   A similar rule applies to all metrics sent by the Go tracer (including Runtime Metrics and internal telemetry): the client attempts to send Dogstatsd data to the Unix domain socket `/var/run/datadog/dsd.socket` and defaults to `http://localhost:8125` if that does not exist.

   If you require different hosts or ports, use one or more of the following environment variables. The examples show the defaults, but you can set them to other values as well.

   ```
   DD_AGENT_HOST=localhost   # The host to send traces and metrics to. Defaults to localhost.
   DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT=8126  # The port to send traces to. Defaults to 8126.
   DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT=8125    # The port to send Dogstatsd metrics to. Defaults to 8125.
   ```

4. Set `DD_SITE` in the Datadog Agent to {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} to ensure the Agent sends data to the right Datadog location.

Tracing is available for a number of other environments, such as  [Heroku][1], [Cloud Foundry][2], [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][3], and [Azure App Service][4].

For other environments, please refer to the [Integrations][5] documentation for that environment and [contact support][6] if you are encountering any setup issues.

## Activate Go integrations to create spans

Datadog has a series of pluggable packages which provide out-of-the-box support for instrumenting a series of libraries and frameworks. A list of these packages can be found in the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page. Import these packages into your application and follow the configuration instructions listed alongside each [Integration][1].

## Library configuration

If needed, configure the tracing library to send application performance telemetry data as you require, including setting up Unified Service Tagging. Read [Library Configuration][3] for details.

For configuration instructions and details about using the API, see the Datadog [API documentation][4].
