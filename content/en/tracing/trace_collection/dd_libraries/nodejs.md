## Compatibility requirements

The latest version of the NodeJS Tracer officially supports versions `>=12`. Versions `8` and `10` are supported in maintenance mode on the `0.x` release line. For more information about our Node version support and the supported versions, see the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Installation and getting started

To add the Datadog tracing library to your Node.js applications, follow these steps:

1. Install the Datadog Tracing library using npm for Node.js 12+:

    ```sh
    npm install dd-trace --save
    ```
    If you need to trace end-of-life Node.js versions 10 or 8, install version 0.x of `dd-trace` by running:
    ```
    npm install dd-trace@latest-node10
    ```
    or
    ```
    npm install dd-trace@latest-node8
    ```
    For more information on our distribution tags and Node.js runtime version support, see the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

2. Import and initialize the tracer either in code or via command line arguments. The Node.js tracing library needs to be imported and initialized **before** any other module.

   Once you have completed setup, if you are not receiving complete traces, including missing URL routes for web requests, or disconnected or missing spans, **confirm step 2 has been correctly done**.  The tracing library being initialized first is necessary for the tracer to properly patch all of the required libraries for automatic instrumentation.

   When using a transpiler such as TypeScript, Webpack, Babel, or others, import and initialize the tracer library in an external file and then import that file as a whole when building your application.

3. [Configure the Datadog Agent for APM](#configure-the-datadog-agent-for-apm)

4. Add any desired [configuration](#configuration) to the tracer, such as `service`, `env`, and `version` for [Unified Service Tagging][2].

### Adding the tracer in code

##### JavaScript

```js
// This line must come before importing any instrumented module.
const tracer = require('dd-trace').init();
```

#### TypeScript and bundlers

For TypeScript and bundlers that support EcmaScript Module syntax, initialize the tracer in a separate file in order to maintain correct load
order.

```typescript
// server.ts
import './tracer'; // must come before importing any instrumented module.

// tracer.ts
import tracer from 'dd-trace';
tracer.init(); // initialized in a different file to avoid hoisting.
export default tracer;
```

If the default config is sufficient, or all configuration is done
via environment variables, you can also use `dd-trace/init`, which loads and
initializes in one step.

```typescript
import 'dd-trace/init';
```

### Adding the tracer via command line arguments

Use the `--require` option to Node.js to load and initialize the tracer in one
step.

```sh
node --require dd-trace/init app.js
```

**Note:** This approach requires using environment variables for all
configuration of the tracer.

### Configure the Datadog Agent for APM

Install and configure the Datadog Agent to receive traces from your now instrumented application. By default the Datadog Agent is enabled in your `datadog.yaml` file under `apm_config` with `enabled: true` and listens for trace traffic at `localhost:8126`. For containerized environments, follow the links below to enable trace collection within the Datadog Agent.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Containers" %}}

1. Set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` in the `apm_config` section of your main [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][1].

2. See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

{{< partial name="apm/apm-containers.html" >}}
</br>

3. After having instrumented your application, the tracing client sends traces to `localhost:8126` by default.  If this is not the correct host and port change it by setting the below env variables:

    `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`.

    ```sh
    DD_AGENT_HOST=<HOSTNAME> DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT=<PORT> node server
    ```

    To use a different protocol such as UDS, specify the entire URL as a single ENV variable `DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL`.

    ```sh
    DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL=unix:<SOCKET_PATH> node server
    ```

{{< site-region region="us3,us5,eu,gov" >}}

4. Set `DD_SITE` in the Datadog Agent to {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} to ensure the Agent sends data to the right Datadog location.

Tracing is available for a number of other environments, such as  [Heroku][1], [Cloud Foundry][2], [AWS Elastic Beanstalk][3], and [Azure App Service][4].

For other environments, please refer to the [Integrations][5] documentation for that environment and [contact support][6] if you are encountering any setup issues.

See the [tracer settings][3] for the list of initialization options.

## Configuration

If needed, configure the tracing library to send application performance telemetry data as you require, including setting up Unified Service Tagging. Read [Library Configuration][4] for details.
