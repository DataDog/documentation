title: Single Step Instrumentation v0.13.1
private: true
---

The Agent installer script now installs version 0.13.1 of Single Step Instrumentation. Previous versions of Single Step Instrumentation created a temporary file without restricting read permissions. This file contains the environment variables specified when a process is launched. Single Step Instrumentation deletes the file automatically, although in rare circumstances this may not occur. The permissions on this file have been updated. If you find any files in the `/tmp` directory of your Linux hosts whose names start with `dd_process_info_` , we recommend deleting them.

Customers who use Single Step Instrumentation for Linux Hosts should update to the latest version of Single Step Instrumentation by running the Datadog installer script with the environment variable `DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=host` :

```sh
DD_API_KEY=<YOUR_DD_API_KEY> DD_SITE="<YOUR_DD_SITE>" DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=host DD_ENV=<AGENT_ENV> bash -c "$(curl -L https://install.datadoghq.com/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh)"
```
