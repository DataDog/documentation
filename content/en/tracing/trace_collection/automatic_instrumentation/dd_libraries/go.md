## Compatibility requirements

The Go Tracer requires Go `1.18+` and Datadog Agent `>= 5.21.1`. For a full list of Datadog's Go version and framework support (including legacy and maintenance versions), see the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Getting started

Before you begin, make sure you've already [installed and configured the Agent][5].

### Activate Go integrations to create spans

Datadog has a series of pluggable packages which provide out-of-the-box support for instrumenting a series of libraries and frameworks. A list of these packages can be found in the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page. Import these packages into your application and follow the configuration instructions listed alongside each [Integration][1].

## Configuration

If needed, configure the tracing library to send application performance telemetry data as you require, including setting up Unified Service Tagging. Read [Library Configuration][3] for details.

For configuration instructions and details about using the API, see the Datadog [API documentation][4].
