## Compatibility requirements
The latest Python Tracer supports CPython versions 2.7 and 3.5-3.11.

For a full list of Datadog's Python version and framework support (including legacy and maintenance versions), read the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Getting started

Before you begin, make sure you've already [installed and configured the Agent][13].

### Instrument your application

After you install and configure your Datadog Agent, the next step is to add the tracing library directly in the application to instrument it. Read more about [compatibility information][1].

To begin tracing applications written in Python, install the Datadog Tracing library, `ddtrace`, using pip:

```python
pip install ddtrace
```

**Note:** This command requires pip version `18.0.0` or greater. For Ubuntu, Debian, or another package manager, update your pip version with the following command:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then to instrument your Python application use the included `ddtrace-run` command. To use it, prefix your Python entry-point command with `ddtrace-run`.

For example, if your application is started with `python app.py` then:

```shell
ddtrace-run python app.py
```

Once you've finished setup and are running the tracer with your application, you can run `ddtrace-run --info` to check that configurations are working as expected. Note that the output from this command does not reflect configuration changes made during runtime in code.

## Configuration

If needed, configure the tracing library to send application performance telemetry data as you require, including setting up Unified Service Tagging. Read [Library Configuration][3] for details.

The connection for traces can also be configured in code:

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

# Network sockets
tracer.configure(
    https=False,
    hostname="custom-hostname",
    port="1234",
)

# Unix domain socket configuration
tracer.configure(
    uds_path="/var/run/datadog/apm.socket",
)
```

The connection for stats can also be configured in code:

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

# Network socket
tracer.configure(
  dogstatsd_url="udp://localhost:8125",
)

# Unix domain socket configuration
tracer.configure(
  dogstatsd_url="unix:///var/run/datadog/dsd.socket",
)
```

### Upgrading to v1

If you are upgrading to ddtrace v1, review the [upgrade guide][4] and the [release notes][5] in the library documentation for full details.
