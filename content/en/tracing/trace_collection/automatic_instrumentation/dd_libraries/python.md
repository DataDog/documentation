## Compatibility requirements
For a full list of Datadog's Python version and framework support (including legacy and maintenance versions), read the [Compatibility Requirements][1] page.

## Getting started

Before you begin, make sure you've already [installed and configured the Agent][13].

### Instrument your application

After you install and configure your Datadog Agent, the next step is to add the tracing library directly in the application to instrument it. Read more about [compatibility information][1].

To begin tracing applications written in Python, install the Datadog Tracing library, `ddtrace`, using pip:

```python
pip install ddtrace
```

**Note:** This command requires pip version `18.0.0` or greater. For Ubuntu, Debian, or another package manager, update your pip version with the following command:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then to instrument your Python application use the included `ddtrace-run` command. To use it, prefix your Python entry-point command with `ddtrace-run`.

For example, if your application is started with `python app.py` then:

```shell
ddtrace-run python app.py
```

Once you've finished setup and are running the tracer with your application, you can run `ddtrace-run --info` to check that configurations are working as expected. Note that the output from this command does not reflect configuration changes made during runtime in code.

## Configuration

If needed, configure the tracing library to send application performance telemetry data as you require, including setting up Unified Service Tagging. Read [Library Configuration][3] for details.

The connection for traces can also be configured in code:

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

# Network sockets
tracer.configure(
    https=False,
    hostname="custom-hostname",
    port="1234",
)

# Unix domain socket configuration
tracer.configure(
    uds_path="/var/run/datadog/apm.socket",
)
```

The connection for stats can also be configured in code:

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

# Network socket
tracer.configure(
  dogstatsd_url="udp://localhost:8125",
)

# Unix domain socket configuration
tracer.configure(
  dogstatsd_url="unix:///var/run/datadog/dsd.socket",
)
```

## Upgrading to dd-trace-py v3

Version 3.0.0 of `dd-trace-py` drops support for Python 3.7 and removes previously deprecated APIs. This guide provides steps to help you upgrade your application.

With the release of `v3.0.0`, the `2.x` release line is now in maintenance mode. Only critical bug fixes will be backported. For more details, see the [versioning support policy][14].

### Step 1: Detect deprecations

To ensure a smooth transition, first upgrade to the latest v2 release (`2.21.0`) and use the following tools to find any deprecated code that will break in v3.

#### In tests

Run `pytest` with warnings enabled as errors to identify areas in your test suite that need updates:

```sh
pytest -W "error::ddtrace.DDTraceDeprecationWarning" tests.py
```

#### In applications

Set the`PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable to surface deprecation warnings when you run your application.

```sh
PYTHONWARNINGS=all python app.py
```

### Step 2: Address breaking changes

After identifying potential issues, review the following breaking changes. Update your code to be compatible with v3 before proceeding with the upgrade.

#### Environment Variable Changes

The following environment variables have been removed or replaced. Update your configuration with the new variables where applicable.

You can use the following command to find all occurrences of these deprecated variables in your codebase:

```sh
git grep -P -e "DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME" \
  -e "_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES" \
  -e "_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=.*b3 single header" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_API_VERSION=v0.3" \
  -e "DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED" \
  -e "DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK" \
  -e "DD_TRACE_METHODS=.*\[\]"
```

| `DD_TRACE_METHODS` (using `[]` notation)        | You must use the `:` notation. For example: `mod.submod:method2;mod.submod:Class.method1`. See the [DD_TRACE_METHODS][16] for details. |
| `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE="b3 single header"` | Use `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3` for identical behavior.                                                                            |
| `DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE`                          | Use `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` instead. See [User-Defined Rules][17] for details.            |
| `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK`                | Removed. This feature has been removed and the variable is a no-op.                                                                    |

<div class="alert alert-info">These changes only apply to <code>dd-trace-py</code> configuration and not the Datadog Agent.</div>

#### API and interface changes

The following methods, attributes, and behaviors have been removed or changed.

##### General

- **Python 3.7 Support**: Support for Python 3.7 is removed.

##### Tracing

- **Multiple Tracer Instances**: Support for multiple `Tracer` instances is removed. You must use the global `ddtrace.tracer` instance.
- `Tracer.configure()`: Deprecated parameters have been removed. Use environment variables to configure Agent connection details (`hostname`, `port`), sampling, and other settings.
- `Span.sampled`: This attribute is removed. Use `span.context.sampling_priority > 0` to check if a span is sampled.
- `ddtrace.opentracer`: The `_dd_tracer` attribute is removed. Use the global `ddtrace.tracer` instead.
- `LLMObs.annotate()`: The `parameters` argument is removed. Use `metadata` instead.
- `choose_matcher()`: Callables and regex patterns are no longer allowed as arguments to `ddtrace.tracer.sampler.rules[].choose_matcher`. You must now pass a string.

##### LLM Observability

- **OpenAI and Langchain**: Support for OpenAI v0.x and Langchain v0.0.x is dropped.

##### CI Visibility

- The new pytest plugin is now the default.
- Module, suite, and test names are now parsed from `item.nodeid`.
- Test names for class-based tests now include the class name (for example, `TestClass::test_method`).
- Test skipping is now performed at the suite level.

#### Step 3: Upgrade the library

Once you have updated your code to address the breaking changes, you can upgrade to the latest v3 release.

```sh
pip install --upgrade ddtrace
```

#### Python 3.13 compatibility

Full support for Python 3.13 is in active development. The following list details compatibility status as of `dd-trace-py` v3.0. For the most current information, see the  [dd-trace-py][18] repository.

**Note**: `dd-trace-py` does not work on Windows with Python 3.13.

The following features may be compatible, but **have not been verified** with Python 3.13:
- **Products**: AppSec IAST, Code Coverage, Data Streams Monitoring, CI Visibility, Continuous Profiling.
- **Features**: Automatic Service Naming.
- **Integrations**: `anthropic`, `consul`, `freezegun`, `gevent`, `google_generativeai`, `gunicorn`, `langchain`, `mysqlclient`, `opentracing`, `psycopg`, `psycopg2`, `pymysql`, `pytest`, `pytest-bdd`, `pytest-benchmark`, `sanic`, `selenium`, `sqlite3`, `starlette`, `tornado`, `vertexai`.
- **AppSec Threat Detection**: Not tested against Django, Flask, or FastAPI.
