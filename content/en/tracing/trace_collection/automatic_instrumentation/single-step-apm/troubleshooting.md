## Overview

Single Step Instrumentation (SSI) helps instrument applications by automatically loading application processes with the Datadog APM SDKs. SSI works for applications running on Linux hosts, in container environments such as Kubernetes and Docker, and for .NET applications served by Windows IISâ€”without requiring changes to application dependencies or images. If you encounter issues enabling APM with SSI, use this guide to troubleshoot and resolve common problems. For further assistance, contact [Datadog Support][1].

## Troubleshooting methods

You can troubleshoot injection issues in two ways: by using Fleet Automation in Datadog or by manually verifying at the container level.

### Troubleshoot injection in Datadog Fleet Automation

{{< callout btn_hidden="true" header="false">}}
Instrumentation insights in Fleet Automation is available in Preview.
{{< /callout >}}

Using Datadog, you can identify and troubleshoot instrumentation issues across your infrastructure. You can see information like:
- Which hosts have SSI enabled
- Which processes failed instrumentation and why
- Which services were instrumented successfully
- Process-level details to help debug injection failures

#### Prerequisites

Instrumentation insights are available for:

- **Languages**: Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, .NET
- **Environments**: Linux hosts, containers, Kubernetes
- Datadog Agent v7.68.2+

#### View instrumentation insights 

To access instrumentation insights in Datadog:

1. Navigate to [Fleet Automation][9].
1. Use facets to filter down to relevant hosts:
   - `single_step_instrumentation` shows which hosts have SSI enabled or disabled.
   - `single_step_instrumentation_status` shows which hosts have encountered issues with service instrumentation.
1. Select a host to open the Agent details panel.
1. In the Agent panel, go to the **Services** tab.
1. If SSI is enabled on the host, the tab shows:
   - A banner with the message: "Single Step Instrumentation is enabled on this host."
   - An **SDK Installations** section if there are issues to troubleshoot.

### Manually verify injection in the application container

If the Datadog UI does not show any instrumentation issues, or if you're troubleshooting a single service or container, you can manually verify whether injection occurred as expected. This method is helpful when debugging in environments where centralized visibility is limited or when a specific service isn't reporting traces.

To confirm injection at the container level, check that:

1. `/etc/ld.so.preload` includes the following entry: 
   ```
   /opt/datadog-packages/datadog-apm-inject/stable/inject/launcher.preload.so
   ``` 
2. The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is set to the same value.
3. The directory `/opt/datadog-packages/datadog-apm-inject` exists, with `stable` and `$version` subdirectories.
4. Language-specific directories exist (for example, `/opt/datadog/apm/library/java/` for Java).

To enable debug logs:

1. Set the following in your pod spec:
 
   {{< code-block lang="yaml" disable_copy="true" collapsible="true" >}}
   env:
     - name: DD_TRACE_DEBUG    # debug logging for the tracer
       value: "true"
     - name: DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_DEBUG    # debug logging for the injector
       value: "true"
   {{< /code-block >}}
   
2. Delete the pod to enable debug logs during injection.

## Configuration options that affect injection

There are several configuration mechanisms that can block or alter injection behavior.

### Storage requirements

SSI downloads language tracing libraries and an injector package onto each host. The amount of disk space required depends on the number of languages in use and the number of pods being instrumented. A rough estimate is:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre><code>[sum of the language library sizes]
+
[injector package size] * [number of injected pods per host]</code></pre>
</div>

Because library packages are updated frequently and may grow when support for new language versions is added, disk usage can change over time. If your environment has limited disk space, monitor package sizes and allow extra capacity to avoid injection failures.

### Injector version

To set the injector version:
- At the cluster level:
  
  Set in `values.yaml` under `datadog.apm.instrumentation.injector.imageTag`.

- At the pod level:
 
  Set with the annotation `admission.datadoghq.com/apm-inject.version`.


For host or Docker injection, modifying the `auto_inject` version is not recommended. 

### Allow and deny lists

#### Default deny list

Datadog maintains an internal deny list to prevent injection into certain processes (for example, IDEs or databases). If a process command or entrypoint is on this list, the injector skips the injection process.  

#### Linux workload selection

{{< callout url="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMu6WAsUCD3djkl_oN0Qh7fQmBCiKYyUvuqlYWRyObebAc6Q/viewform" header="Join the Preview!">}}
Workload selection is available for Linux-based apps through a limited availability preview. To configure allow or deny rules for process injection, sign up for preview access.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Kubernetes workload selection  

Workload selection enables injection based on Kubernetes labels and selectors. Rules to consider:

1. `disabledNamespaces` always takes precedence.
2. When a pod initializes, the target list is checked from top to bottom. Only the first matching rule applies per pod.

#### Injection container flagged by security scanners

Security tools may flag the `apm-inject` container because it runs an executable at startup, which can resemble malicious software. 

The container's behavior is expected and safe; the executable configures the environment for auto-instrumentation.

Datadog adheres to security best practices and is working with security vendors to allowlist this container.

### Environments with strict pod security settings

If pod security rules block the Datadog init container, you may see errors like:
```
Privilege escalation container is not allowed or violates PodSecurity "restricted: latest": allowPrivilegeEscalation is false
```

To resolve this, set one of the following Cluster Agent options:
- `DD_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INIT_SECURITY_CONTEXT`
- `admission_controller.auto_instrumentation.init_security_context`

The value should be a JSON string that applies the necessary security context to the Datadog init containers.  

### Custom instrumentation

Custom instrumentation still requires you to import the tracing library. Configuration variables like .NET's `DD_TRACE_METHODS` remain available for defining custom spans.

## Environment-specific troubleshooting

### Host and Docker environments

#### Host injection does not apply to existing processes

The preload library only injects into newly launched processes. Start a new shell session or log out and log back in to apply instrumentation.

**Note:** Docker-based injection does not have this limitation.

#### Injection fails on small instance types

The preload library allows the analyzer one second to complete its work. On small VM instances running multiple services (for example, `t2.micro`), this time limit may be exceeded. To overcome this issue, use a larger instance size, such as `t2.small`.

#### Errors after manual uninstallation of agent files

If you manually delete agent files, you may see errors like:
```
ERROR: ld.so: object /opt/datadog/apm/inject/launcher.preload.so from /etc/ld.so.preload cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored
```

To properly uninstall SSI, follow the platform-specific instructions:

* [Kubernetes][1]
* [Docker][2]
* [Linux][3]
* [Windows][4]

#### Injection not working with rootless Docker

When using rootless Docker, set `docker_socket` in `/etc/datadog-agent/inject/docker_config.yaml` to the path of the Docker socket used by the current user (typically `/run/user/$UID/docker.sock`). No reboot is required.

#### Injection fails with statically linked launchers

If a custom launcher is statically linked (common with Go), the preload library might not be invoked. Injection can still succeed if:
- The launcher's command line includes the language name
- The launcher runs an intermediary dynamically linked program

However, direct process launches from statically linked binaries are not injected.

### Kubernetes environments

The Datadog Admission Controller must be deployed and configured before application pods are created; it cannot modify existing pods.

To troubleshoot Admission Controller issues:

1. Check Cluster Agent pod health:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get deployments
   ```
1. Check the Cluster Agent leader logs for `INFO` messages indicating successful Admission Controller startup. For example:

   ```
   Group version 'admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1' is available, Starting secrets controller, Starting webhook controller
   ```

1. Check the Admission Controller status by doing one of the following:

   - Run `agent status` inside the Cluster Agent pod to get a live status output.
   - If troubleshooting retrospectively, check `status.log` within a flare. When a flare is generated, the system runs `agent status` and stores the output in `status.log`.

   In both cases, find the Admission Controller and Webhooks sections, and verify the following:
   - All expected `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resources are listed (for auto-instrumentation, configuration injection, and tag injection).
   - The webhook configurations reference the correct Secret.
   - The CA bundle digest matches across configurations.

1. Inspect injection attempts in `telemetry.log` or in the output of the following command:

   ```
   kubectl exec -it <cluster agent pod> agent telemetry
   ```

   Look for `admission_webhooks_library_injection_attempts` to see injection attempts by language.

#### Failed mutations

The Cluster Agent logs warnings and errors for injection failures, typically from `admission/server.go`. For example, a warning might appear if `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` is set using `valueFrom`.

Use the metric `datadog.cluster_agent.admission_webhooks.library_injection_errors` for further debugging.

##### Language annotation cannot be applied

During setup, SSI detects the application language of your service and applies a service label in the form `internal.dd.datadoghq.com/service-name.detected_langs`. If the label cannot be applied, injection fails.

Sometimes, labeling errors occur because a service name breaks Kubernetes string limits ([63 characters][6]). For example:
```
languagedetection/patcher.go:231 in handleDeploymentEvent) | failed to handle deployment event: annotations: Invalid value: "internal.dd.datadoghq.com/dummy-python-container-long-long-long-long-long-x.detected_langs": name part must be no more than 63 characters
```

String limit violations are common if service tags are not explicitly set through [Unified Service Tagging][8], in which case default image names are used.

##### Injection appears successful but traces are missing

If logs show no issues but traces are missing, there may be an application-side misconfiguration. Verify that:
- Required annotations and labels are present.
- [Unified Service Tagging][8] is set up correctly.
- Allow/deny lists for workload selection are properly defined.

## Language-specific troubleshooting

### Java

#### `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` is too long

The `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable has a JVM-enforced limit of 1024 characters. During injection, Datadog appends a `-javaagent` flag to this variable to enable tracing. If the combined value exceeds the limit, the JVM emits a warning and ignores the variable, preventing injection.

To avoid this issue, exclude the affected process from injection.

####  `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` changes program output

When `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` is set, the JVM prints a message to stdout, such as `Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Xmx1024m`. If a process reads and depends on this output, it may be affected.

As of version 0.12.2, injection is skipped for `java -version` to avoid interfering with processes that parse its output.

#### Multiple Java sites report under the same service name

By default, Single Step sets the `DD_SERVICE` environment variable, which applies a single service name across all web applications running on the same server (such as Tomcat or WebLogic). As a result, all sites report under the same name.

Use one of the following options to enable **split-by-tags** so that each site reports under its own name:
- JVM system property: `-Ddd.trace.split-by-tags=servlet.context`
- Environment variable: `DD_TRACE_SPLIT_BY_TAGS=servlet.context`

#### Tracer already exists

SSI does not inject into applications that already use a `-javaagent` option or other tracing configuration.

### Ruby

Ruby injection modifies the `Gemfile` to add the Datadog tracing library. If injection support is later removed, the application may fail to start due to the missing dependency.

To resolve this, restore the original `Gemfile`. If you still want to use APM after removing injection, run `bundle install` to download the gem.

### Python

Versions <=2.7.5 contain a pre-packaged protobuf dependency that can conflict with system libraries.
 
## Collect diagnostic information for support

When contacting support about injection issues, collect the following information to assist troubleshooting:

1. Are you using host injection, Docker injection, or both?
1. Verify that the `/opt/datadog-packages/datadog-apm*` directories exist.
1. For host injection, check for the existence and permissions of `/etc/ld.so.preload`:

   ```
   sudo ls -l /etc/ld.so.preload
   ```

   It should be owned by `root` with `644` permissions (`-rw-r--r--`).

1. Enable injector debug logs by setting the environment variable:

   ```
   DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_DEBUG=true
   ```

   By default, logs are written to stderr.

   - For host injection, you can send logs to a file by setting:
     ```
     DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_OUTPUT_PATHS=<log_file_path>
     ```

   - For Docker injection, logs can be viewed using `docker logs` or `docker compose logs`.

1. Provide an Agent flare.

### Additional information for Kubernetes-based injection

Collect the following details if troubleshooting injection in a Kubernetes environment:

- The method used to deploy the Cluster Agent (for example, Helm, Datadog Operator, or kubectl commands).
- Deployment files for the application pod.
- Flares from both the Node Agent and the Cluster Agent, ideally with `DEBUG` mode enabled.
- Output of:
  ```
  kubectl describe pod <app pod>
  ```
- Injector debug logs from the application container:
  - Set `DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_DEBUG: true`
  - Logs are printed to stderr by default, or can be routed to a file through:
    ```
    DD_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_OUTPUT_PATHS=<log_file_path>
    ```
