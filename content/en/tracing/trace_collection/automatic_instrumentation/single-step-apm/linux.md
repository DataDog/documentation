## Overview

On a Linux host or VM, use Single Step Instrumentation (SSI) for APM to install the Datadog Agent and [instrument][14] your applications in one step, with no additional configuration required. 

## Enable APM on your applications

To enable APM on a Ubuntu host:

1. In the Datadog app, navigate to the [Install the Datadog Agent on Linux][15] page.
1. Turn on **APM Instrumentation**.
1. Copy and run the Agent installation command on your Linux host or VM.
1. Restart your applications.

## Setting Unified Service Tags

Unified Service Tags (USTs) connect traces, metrics, and logs by applying consistent tags across your telemetry. This makes it easier to navigate your observability data.

Learn how to set [USTs for non-containerized environments][16].

## Controlling SDK tracer versions

By default, Single Step Instrumentation installs the latest major versions of Datadog APM SDKs. Minor version updates are applied automatically when they become available.

You may want to customize SDK versions based on your application's language version or specific environment requirements. You can control the major and minor versions used by customizing library versions during setup.

To customize tracer versions:

1. After you turn on **APM Instrumentation**, click **Customize library versions**.
1. Find your language(s) and use the dropdown to either:
   - Pin an exact tracer version, or
   - Select the major version you want to use.
1. Copy and run the updated installation command.

Available versions are listed in source repositories for each language:

- [Java][8] (`java`)
- [Node.js][9] (`js`)
- [Python][10] (`python`)
- [.NET][11] (`dotnet`)
- [Ruby][12] (`ruby`)
- [PHP][13] (`php`)

## Remove Single Step APM instrumentation from your Agent

If you don't want to collect trace data for a particular service, host, VM, or container, complete the following steps:

### Remove instrumentation for specific services

To remove APM instrumentation and stop sending traces from a specific service:

1. Add the `DD_INSTRUMENT_SERVICE_WITH_APM` environment variable to the service startup command:

   ```shell
   DD_INSTRUMENT_SERVICE_WITH_APM=false <service_start_command>
   ```
2. Restart the service.

### Remove APM for all services on the infrastructure

To stop producing traces, uninstall APM and restart the infrastructure:

1. Run:
   ```shell
   dd-host-install --uninstall
   ```
2. Restart the services on the host or VM.
