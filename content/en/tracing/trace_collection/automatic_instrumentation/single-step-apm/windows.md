## Overview

With Single Step Instrumentation (SSI), you can automatically enable APM for your .NET Framework and .NET Core applications running on Windows IIS, using a single MSI command during the Datadog Agent installation. No separate SDK installation or code changes are required.

## Enable APM on Windows

To enable APM with Single Step Instrumentation on Windows:

1. In the Datadog app, go to the Install Datadog [Windows Agent page][1] .
1. Under Customize your observability coverage, toggle APM Instrumentation on.
1. Copy and run the provided MSI install command on your Windows host.
1. Restart the IIS applications you want instrumented. (You do not need to restart the entire IIS server.)

Once installed, the Agent automatically loads the Datadog .NET SDK into supported application processes to enable distributed tracing.

**Note:** Only .NET applications running in IIS are supported for Single Step Instrumentation on Windows.

## Set SDK Tracer Versions

By default, Single Step Instrumentation installs the latest supported version of the Datadog .NET Tracer.

If you need to pin a specific version:

1. From the Windows Agent install page, after toggling APM Instrumentation, select Customize library versions.
1. Under .NET, choose the version you want to use.
1. Copy the updated MSI command and run it on your host.

## Remove Single Step APM instrumentation from your Agent


To disable SSI for .NET on your host run:

```shell
&"C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\bin\datadog-installer.exe" remove datadog-apm-library-dotnet
```
