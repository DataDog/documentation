## Runtime support policy for PHP APM

The PHP Datadog Trace library is open source - view the [GitHub repository][1] for more information.

Datadog APM for PHP is built upon dependencies defined in specific versions of the host operating system, PHP runtime,
certain PHP libraries, and the Datadog Agent or API.
When these versions are no longer supported by their maintainers, Datadog APM for PHP limits its support for these as well.

#### Levels of support

| **Level**                                              | **Support provided**                                                                                                                                                          |

PHP APM supports the following PHP versions (both ZTS and NTS):

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note:</strong>
PHP 5.x is fully supported until version 0.75.0. It is now in maintenance mode and supported with security and important bug fixes until December 31, 2023.
<br>
If you are using PHP 5.x version in your application and have a feature request which is critical for your business needs, contact <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/support/">Datadog Support</a>.
<br>
It's recommended to use <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions">officially supported versions</a> of PHP, especially 7.4, 8.0, and 8.1.

### Integrations

#### Web framework compatibility

By default, Datadog **supports all PHP web frameworks** out of the box, with either framework-level instrumentation, or generic web tracing.

Framework-level instrumentation includes tracing of internal methods and framework specific tagging.

Generic web tracing includes a `web.request` span to track latency and errors that originated from the call, in addition to spans for supported libraries â€” for example: database and HTTP clients.

The following table enumerates some of the frameworks and versions Datadog successfully traces.

**Web frameworks**:

Datadog is continuously adding more support for in-depth tracing for PHP web-frameworks. To request support for additional span metadata and framework internals, contact our awesome [support team][3].

#### CLI library compatibility

Tracing from the CLI SAPI is disabled by default. To enable tracing of PHP CLI scripts, set `DD_TRACE_CLI_ENABLED=true`.

#### Deep call stacks on PHP 5

The call stack is limited on PHP 5. See the [deep call stack troubleshooting page][5] for more details.

### Generators

Instrumenting [generators][6] is not supported on PHP 5 and PHP 7.

### PCNTL

Datadog supports tracing forked processes using [pcntl][7]. When a call to `pcntl_fork` is detected, a dedicated span is created, and the forked process is instrumented. This can be disabled with `DD_TRACE_FORKED_PROCESS`. Refer to the [library configuration page][9] for more details.

If the application invokes `pcntl_unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER);` and the tracer is installed, the application fatally crashes. This happens because `unshare` with `CLONE_NEWUSER` requires the process [not to be threaded][8], while the PHP tracer uses a separate thread to send traces to the Datadog Agent without blocking the main process.
