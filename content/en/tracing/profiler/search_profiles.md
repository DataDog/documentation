Each row is a profile of a process for a short amount of time. By default, profiles are uploaded once a minute. Depending on the language, these processes are profiled between 15s and 60s.

You can filter according to infrastructure tags or application tags set up from your [environment tracing configuration][1]. By default the following facets are available:

| Facet    | Definition                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Env      | The environment your application is running on (`production`, `staging`).                                    |
| Service  | The name of the [service][2] your code is running.                                                     |
| Version  | The version of your code.                                                                              |
| Host     | The hostname your profiled process is running on. |
| Runtime  | The type of runtime the profiled process is running (`JVM`, `CPython`).                                |

The following measures are available:

| Measure           | Definition                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU              | CPU usage, measured in cores. |
| Memory Allocation | Memory allocation rate over the course of the profile. This value can be above the amount of memory on your system because allocated memory can be garbage collected during the profile. |



## Profiles

Click on a line to view a specific profile:

{{< img src="tracing/profiling/profiling_flamegraph.gif" alt="A specic profile">}}

The header contains information associated with your profile, like the service that generated it, or the environment and code version associated to it.

Four tabs are below the profile header:

| Tab          | Definition                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Profiles     | A flame graph and summary table of the profile you are looking at. You can switch between profile types (`CPU`, `Memory allocation`). |
| Analysis     | A set of heuristics that suggest potential issues or areas of improvement in your code. Currently only available for Java.                   |
| Metrics      | Profiler metrics coming from all profiles of the same service.                                                                              |
| Runtime Info | Runtime properties in supported languages, and profile tags.                                                                                                     |

**Note**: In the upper right corner of each profile, there are options to:

- Download the profile
- Switch the profile to full screen


### Profile types

In the **Profiles** tab, you can see all profile types available for a given language. Depending on the language, the information collected about your profile differs.

Once enabled, the following profile types are collected:

| Profile type             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU in Java Code         | Shows the time each method spent running on the CPU. It includes your code that runs in the JVM (Java, Kotlin, etc), but not JVM operations or native code called from within the JVM.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Allocation               | Shows the amount of heap memory allocated by each method, including allocations which were subsequently freed.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Wall Time in Native Code | Shows the elapsed time spent in native code. Elapsed time includes time when code is running on CPU, waiting for I/O, and anything else that happens while the method is running. This profile does not include time spent running JVM bytecode, which is typically most of your application code. |
| Class load               | Shows the number of classes loaded by each method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Exception Profile                    | Shows the number of errors and exceptions thrown by each method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| File I/O                 | Shows the time each method spent reading from and writing to files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Lock                     | Shows the time each method spent waiting for a lock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Allocation               | Shows the amount of heap memory allocated by each function since the start of the application, including allocations which were subsequently freed. Go calls this `alloc_space`. This is useful for investigating garbage collection load.              |
| Allocation Count         | Shows the number of objects allocated in heap memory by each function since the start of the application, including allocations which were subsequently freed. This is useful for investigating garbage collection load.     |
| Heap                     | Shows the amount of heap memory allocated by each function that remained allocated since the start of the application and lived since the last garbage collection. Go calls this `inuse_space`. This is useful for investigating the overall memory usage of your service.               |
| Heap Count               | Shows the number of objects allocated in heap memory by each function, and which objects remained allocated since the start of the application and lived since the last garbage collection.
