## Missing profiles in the profile search page

If you've configured the profiler and don't see profiles in the profile search page, turn on [debug mode][1] and [open a support ticket][2] with debug files and the following information:

- Operating system type and version (for example, Linux Ubuntu 14.04.3)
- Runtime type, version, and vendor (for example, Java OpenJDK 11 AdoptOpenJDK)

## Removing sensitive information from profiles

If your system properties contain sensitive information such as user names or passwords, turn off the system property event by creating a `jfp` [override template file](#creating-and-using-a-jfr-template-override-file) with `jdk.InitialSystemProperty` disabled:

{{< code-block lang="text" filename="example-template.jfp" >}}
jdk.InitialSystemProperty#enabled=false
{{< /code-block >}}

## Large allocation events overwhelming the profiler

To turn off allocation profiling, disable the following events in your `jfp` [override template file](#large-allocation-events-overwhelming-the-profiler):

{{< code-block lang="text" filename="example-template.jfp" >}}
jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB#enabled=false
jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB#enabled=false
{{< /code-block >}}

## Exceptions overwhelming the profiler

The Datadog exception profiler has a small footprint and overhead under normal conditions. If a lot of exceptions are created and thrown, it can cause significant overhead for the profiler. This can happen when you use exceptions for control flow. If you have an unusually high exception rate, turn off exception profiling temporarily until you fix the cause.

To disable exception profiling, start the tracer with the `-Ddd.integration.throwables.enabled=false` JVM setting.

Remember to turn this setting back on after you've returned to a more typical rate of exceptions.

## Java 8 support

The following OpenJDK 8 vendors are supported for Continuous Profiling because they include JDK Flight Recorder in their latest versions:

| Vendor                      | JDK version that includes Flight Recorder                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Azul                        | u212 (u262 is recommended)                                     |
| AdoptOpenJDK                | u262                                                           |
| RedHat                      | u262                                                           |
| Amazon (Corretto)           | u262                                                           |
| Bell-Soft (Liberica)        | u262                                                           |
| All vendors upstream builds             | u272                                                           |

If your vendor is not on the list, [open a support ticket][2], we can let you know if we're planning to support it or if we already offer beta support.

## Creating and using a JFR template override file

Override templates let you specify profiling properties to override. However, the default settings are balanced for a good tradeoff between overhead and data density that cover most use cases. To use an override file, perform the following steps:

1. Create an override file in a directory accessible by `dd-java-agent` at service invocation:
    ```
    touch dd-profiler-overrides.jfp
    ```

2. Add your desired overrides to the jfp file. For example, to disable allocation profiling and JVM system properties, your `dd-profiler-overrides.jfp` file would look like the following:

    {{< code-block lang="text" filename="example-template.jfp" >}}
    jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB#enabled=false
    jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB#enabled=false
    jdk.InitialSystemProperty#enabled=false
    {{< /code-block >}}

3. When running your application with `dd-java-agent`, your service invocation must point to the override file with `-Ddd.profiling.jfr-template-override-file=</path/to/override.jfp>`, for example:

    {{< code-block lang="text" filename="example-template.jfp" >}}
    java -javaagent:/path/to/dd-java-agent.jar -Ddd.profiling.enabled=true -Ddd.logs.injection=true -Ddd.trace.sample.rate=1 -Ddd.profiling.jfr-template-override-file=</path/to/override.jfp> -jar path/to/your/app.jar
    {{< /code-block >}}
