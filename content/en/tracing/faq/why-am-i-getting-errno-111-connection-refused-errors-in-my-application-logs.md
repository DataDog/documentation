Either the Agent is not running, or your application's tracer client isn't configured correctly. By default, the tracer client libraries submit to localhost on port 8126. If this is not where your Agent is listeningâ€”perhaps it's listening in some Docker container adjacent to your application container-point your tracer client to where it's running, e.g. `tracer.configure(hostname="172.17.0.1")`.

If you're running the Agent in a Docker container, see the [docker-dd-agent documentation][1] for more information.
