title: Installing the trace Agent from source
kind: faq
---

## Install from source

1. Install `Go 1.11+`. For more information, see the steps on the [official Go website][1].
2. Clone the [Datadog Agent repo][2]
3. Run this command in the root of the `datadog-agent` repository:
    ```bash
    go install ./cmd/trace-agent
    ```
4. Run the Agent using `trace-agent` (assuming the path `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system's `$PATH`). 

### Troubleshooting

Check the Agent output or logs (`/var/log/datadog/trace-agent.log` on Linux) to ensure that traces seem correct 
and that they are reaching the Datadog API.
