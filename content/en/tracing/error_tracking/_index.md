## What is error tracking?

Monitoring the errors collected by Datadog is critical to your system's health, but there can be so many individual error events that itâ€™s hard to identify which ones matter the most and should be fixed first. Error Tracking makes it easier to monitor errors by:

- __Grouping similar errors into issues__ to turn this noisy flow of errors into a small list of manageable issues.
- __Following issues over time__ to show when they first started, if they are ongoing, and how often they are occurring, helping you identify the most important ones.
- __Getting all the context in one place__ to facilitate troubleshooting.

## How Datadog error tracking works

The Datadog tracers collect errors through integrations and manual instrumentation of the source code. Error spans within a trace are processed by Error Tracking __when they are located in the uppermost service span__, which is also called the _service entry span_.

Error Tracking computes a fingerprint for each error span it processes using the error type, the error message, and the frames that form the stack trace. Errors with the same fingerprint are grouped together and belong to the same _issue_.
