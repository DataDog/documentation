## What is error tracking?

Datadog collects a lot of errors. It's critical to your system's health to monitor these errors, but there can be so many individual error events that itâ€™s hard to identify which ones matter the most and should be fixed first. Error Tracking makes it easier to monitor these errors by:

- __Grouping similar errors into issues__ to reduce the noise and help identify the most important ones.
- __Following issues over time__ to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing, and how often they are occurring.
- __Getting all the context needed in one place__ to facilitate troubleshooting the issue.
