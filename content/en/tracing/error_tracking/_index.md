## What is error tracking?

Monitoring the errors collected by Datadog is critical to your system's health, but there can be so many individual error events that itâ€™s hard to identify which ones matter the most and should be fixed first. Error Tracking makes it easier to monitor errors by:

- __Grouping similar errors into issues__ to turn this noisy flow of errors into a small list of manageable issues.
- __Following issues over time__ to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing, and how often they are occurring to help identify the most important ones.
- __Getting all the context in one place__ to facilitate troubleshooting.

## How does it work?

The Datadog tracers are collecting errors through existing integrations and manual instrumentation of the source code. The different error spans within a trace are processed by Error Tracking __whenever they are located in the uppermost service span__ (also called service entry span).

Error Tracking computes a fingerprint for each individual error span it processes using the error type, the error message as well as the different frames forming the stack trace. Errors with the same fingerprint are grouped together and belong to the same issue.
