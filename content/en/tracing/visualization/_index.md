The APM UI provides many tools to troubleshoot application performance and correlate it throughout the product, which helps you find and resolve issues in highly distributed systems.

## Services

After [instrumenting your application][3], the [Services List][4] is your main landing page for APM data.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service_list.png" alt="service list" >}}

Services are the building blocks of modern microservice architectures - broadly a service groups together endpoints, queries, or jobs for the purposes of scaling instances. Some examples:

* A group of URL endpoints may be grouped together under an API service.
* A group of DB queries that are grouped together within one database service.
* A group of periodic jobs configured in the crond service.

The screenshot below is a microservice distributed system for an e-commerce site builder. There's a `web-store`, `ad-server`, `payment-db`, and `auth-service` all represented as services in APM.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service_map.png" alt="service map" >}}

All services can be found in the [Service List][4] and visually represented on the [Service Map][5]. Each service has its own [Service page][6] where [trace metrics](#trace-metrics) like throughput, latency, and error rates can be viewed and inspected. Use these metrics to create dashboard widgets, create monitors, and see the performance of every resource such as a web endpoint or database query belonging to the service.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service_page.mp4" video="true" alt="service page" >}}

<div class="alert alert-info">
Donâ€™t see the HTTP endpoints you were expecting on the Service page? In APM, endpoints are connected to a service by more than the service name. It is also done with the `span.name` of the entry-point span of the trace. For example, on the web-store service above, `web.request` is the entry-point span. More info on this <a href="/tracing/faq/resource-trace-doesn-t-show-up-under-correct-service/">here</a>.
</div>

## Resources

Resources represent a particular domain of a customer application. They could typically be an instrumented web endpoint, database query, or background job. For a web service, these resources can be dynamic web endpoints that are grouped by a static span name -  `web.request`. In a database service, these would be database queries with the span name `db.query`. For example the `web-store` service has automatically instrumented resources - web endpoints - which handle checkouts, updating_carts, add_item, etc. Each resource has its own [Resource page][7] with [trace metrics](#trace-metrics) scoped to the specific endpoint. Trace metrics can be used like any other Datadog metric - they are exportable to a dashboard or can be used to create monitors. The Resource page also shows the span summary widget with an aggregate view of [spans](#spans) for all [traces](#trace), latency distribution of requests, and traces which show requests made to this endpoint.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/resource_page.mp4" video="true" alt="resource page" >}}

## Trace

A trace is used to track the time spent by an application processing a request and the status of this request. Each trace consists of one or more spans. During the lifetime of the request, you can see distributed calls across services (because a [trace-id is injected/extracted through HTTP headers][8]), [automatically instrumented libraries][3], and [manual instrumentation][9] using open-source tools like [OpenTracing][10] in the flamegraph view. In the Trace View page, each trace collects information that connects it to other parts of the platform, including [connecting logs to traces][11], [adding tags to spans][12], and [collecting runtime metrics][13].

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/trace_view.png" alt="trace view" >}}

## Spans

A span represents a logical unit of work in the system for a given time period. Each span consists of a `span.name`, start time, duration, and [span tags](#span-tags). For example, a span can describe the time spent on a distributed call on a separate machine, or the time spent in a small component within a larger request. Spans can be nested within each other, which creates a parent-child relationship between the spans.

For the example below, the span `rack.request` is the entry-point span of the trace. This means the web-store service page is displaying resources that consist of traces with an entry-point span named `rack.request.` The example also shows the tags added application side (`merchant.store_name`, `merchant.tier`, etc). These user-defined tags can be used to search and analyze APM data in [Analytics][14].

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/span_with_metadata.png" alt="span" >}}

## Top level span

A span is a top level span when it is the entrypoint method for a request to a service.  You can visualize this within Datadog APM when the color of the immediate parent on a flamegraph is a different color.  Services are also listed on the right when viewing a flamegraph.

For the example below, the top level spans are:
- rack.request
- aspnet_coremvc.request
- The topmost green span below aspnet_coremvc.request
- Every orange mongodb span

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/toplevelspans.png" alt="span" >}}

## Trace metrics

[Trace metrics][15] are automatically collected and kept at a 15-month retention policy similar to any other [Datadog metric][2]. They can be used to identify and alert on hits, errors, or latency. Trace metrics are tagged by the host receiving traces along with the service or resource. For example, after instrumenting a web service trace metrics are collected for the entry-point span `web.request` in the [Metric Summary][16].

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/trace_metrics.mp4" video="true" alt="trace metrics" >}}

### Dashboard

Trace metrics can be exported to a dashboard from the *Service* or *Resource* page. Additionally, trace metrics can be queried from an existing dashboard.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/trace_metric_dashboard.mp4" video="true" alt="trace metrics dashboard" >}}

### Monitoring

Trace metrics are useful for monitoring. APM monitors can be set up on the [New Monitors][17], [Service][6], or [Resource][7] page. A set of suggested monitors is available on the [Service][6], or [Resource][7] page.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/trace_metric_monitor.mp4" video="true" alt="trace metrics monitor" >}}

## Trace search and analytics

[Search and perform analytics][14] on 100% of ingested traces for 15 minutes and all [indexed spans](#indexed-span) for 15 days.

## Indexed span

**Note:** Indexed Spans were formerly known as Analyzed Spans and renamed with the launch of Tracing Without Limits on October 20th, 2020.

Indexed Spans represent spans indexed by a [retention filter](#retention-filters) stored in Datadog for 15 days that can be used to search, query, and monitor in [Trace Search and Analytics][14] by the [tags](#span-tags) included on the span.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Creating <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces/retention-filters">tag based retention filters</a> after ingestion allows you to control and visualize exactly how many spans are being indexed per service.
</div>

## Span tags

Tag spans in the form of key-value pairs to correlate a request in the *Trace View* or filter in *Analytics*. Tags can be added to a single span or globally to all spans. For the example below, the requests (`merchant.store_name`, `merchant.tier`, etc.) have been added as tags to the span.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/span_tag.png" alt="span tag" >}}

To get started tagging spans in your application, check out this [walkthrough][12].

After a tag has been added to a span, search and query on the tag in Analytics by clicking on the tag to add it as a [facet][18]. Once this is done, the value of this tag is stored for all new traces and can be used in the search bar, facet panel, and trace graph query.

{{< img src="tracing/app_analytics/search/create_facet.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Create Facet"  style="width:50%;">}}

## Retention filters

[Set tag-based filters][19] in the Datadog UI to index spans for 15 days for use with [Trace Search and Analytics](#trace-search-and-analytics)

## Ingestion controls

[Send 100% of traces][20] from your services to Datadog and combine with [tag-based retention filters](#retention-filters) to keep traces that matter for your business for 15 days.

## Sublayer metric

Some [Tracing Application Metrics][15] are tagged with `sublayer_service` and `sublayer_type` so that you can see the execution duration for individual services within a trace.

## Execution duration

The active spans for a given time, for a given trace, are all of the leaf spans (spans without children).

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/execution_duration.png" style="width:50%;" alt="Execution Duration"  style="width:50%;">}}
