## Overview

Selecting a service on the services page leads you to the detailed service page. A service is a set of processes that do the same job - for example a web framework or database (read more about how services are defined in [Getting Started with APM][1]).

Consult on this page:

* [Service monitor states](#service-monitor)
* [Out of the box graphs](#out-of-the-box-graphs)
* [Resources associated to this service][2]

## Service monitor

Datadog proposes a list of monitors depending on your service type:

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service/service_monitors.png" alt="Service Monitors"  style="width:90%;">}}

Enable them directly or create your own [APM monitors][3].

**Note**: Tag any monitor with `service:<SERVICE_NAME>` to attach it to an APM service.

## Out of the box graphs

Datadog provides out of the box graphs for any given Service:

* Requests - Choose to display:
    *  The **Total amount of requests**
    *  The amount of **Requests per second**
* Latency -  Choose to display:
    *  The Avg/p75/p90/p95/p99/Max latency of your traced requests
    *  The **Apdex score** for web services; [learn more about Apdex][4]
* Error - Choose to display:
    * The **Total amount of errors**
    * The amount of **Errors per second**
    * The **% Error Rate**
* Sub-Services: When there are multiple services involved, a fourth graph is available that breaks down your **Total time spent**/**%of time spent**/**Avg time per request** of your service by *services* or *type*.

    This represents the total/relative/average time spent by traces from the current service to the other *services* or *type*.

    **Note**: For services like *Postgres* or *Redis*, which are "final" operations that do not call other services, there is no sub-services graph.

### Export to timeboard

On the upper-right corner of each graph click on the arrow in order to export your graph into a pre-existing [dashboard][5]:

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service/save_to_dashboard.png" alt="Save to dashboard" style="width:80%;">}}

### Latency distribution

The service page also displays a service latency distribution graph:

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service/service_latency_distribution.png" alt="latency distribution"  style="width:100%;">}}

Use the top right percentile selectors to zoom into a given percentile, or hover over the sidebar to view percentile markers.

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service/latency_distribution_sidebar.png" alt="latency distribution sidebar"  style="width:50%;">}}

## Resources

See the list of [resources][6] associated with your service. Resources are particular actions for your services (typically individual endpoints or queries). Read more about resources in [Getting Started with APM][1]. Sort the resources for this service by requests, latency, errors, and time, to identify areas of high traffic or potential trouble. Note that the these metric columns are configurable (see image below).

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service/resources.png" alt="Resources"  style="width:90%;">}}

[Refer to the dedicated resource documentation to learn more][2].

### Filtering the resources list

Filter your resources list with a query for basic text filtering:

{{< img src="tracing/visualization/service/resources_filtering.mp4" alt="Resource filtering" video="true"  width="90%" >}}

### Columns

Choose what to display in your resources list:

* **Requests**: Absolute amount of requests traced (per seconds)
* **Avg/p75/p90/p95/p99/Max Latency**: The Avg/p75/p90/p95/p99/Max latency of your traced requests
* **Total time**: Sum of all time spend in this resource
* **Error**: Absolute amount of error for a given resource
* **Error Rate**: Percent of error for a given resource
