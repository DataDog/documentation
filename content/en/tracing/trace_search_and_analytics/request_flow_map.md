_Request flow maps_ combine two key features of Datadog APM: the [service map][1] and [live search and analytics][2], to help you understand and track request paths through your stack. Quickly identify noisy services and choke points, or how many database calls are generated by a request to a specific endpoint.

No additional configuration is required to use these flow maps, and they are powered by your [ingested spans][3]. Scope your LIVE (last 15 minutes) traces to any combination of tags and generate a dynamic map that represents the flow of requests between every service. The map is automatically generated based on your search criteria, and will regenerate live after any changes.

## Navigating the request flow map

- Hover over an edge that connects two services to see metrics for requests, errors, and latency for requests between those two services that match the query parameters.

- The highest throughput connections are highlighted to show the most common path.

- Click **Export** to save a PNG image of the current request flow map. This is a great way to generate a live architecture diagram, or one scoped to a specific user flow.

- Click any service on the map to view overall health and performance information for that service (throughput, latency, error rates, monitor status), along with infrastructure and runtime metrics.

- The map automatically selects an appropriate layout based on the number of services present, and you can click **Cluster** or **Flow** to switch between the two available layouts.

- RUM Applications are represented on the request flow map if you have [connected RUM and Traces][4].

Try the [request flow map in the app][5]. To get started, scope a simple query such as a single service or endpoint.

### Examples

Use the request flow map to investigate your application's behavior:

- Search for a [resource][6] that corresponds to a particular HTTP request.

- If you use [shadow deployments][7] or feature flags set as [custom span tags][8], use the map to compare request latency between requests. This is a great pre-production complement to [deployment tracking][9] to observe how potential code changes will impact latency of deployed versions.
