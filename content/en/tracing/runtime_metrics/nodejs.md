## Automatic configuration

Runtime metrics collection can be enabled with one configuration parameter in the tracing client either through the tracer option: `tracer.init({ runtimeMetrics: true })` or through the environment variable: `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED=true`

Runtime metrics can be viewed in correlation with your Node services. See the [Service page][1] in Datadog.

By default, runtime metrics from your application are sent to the Datadog Agent with DogStatsD over port `8125`. Make sure that [DogStatsD is enabled for the Agent][2].
If you are running the Agent as a container, ensure that `DD_DOGSTATSD_NON_LOCAL_TRAFFIC` [is set to true][3], and that port `8125` is open on the Agent.
In Kubernetes, [bind the DogstatsD port to a host port][4]; in ECS, [set the appropriate flags in your task definition][5].

## Data Collected

The following metrics are collected by default after enabling runtime metrics.

Along with displaying these metrics in your APM Service Page, Datadog provides a [default Node Runtime Dashboard][6] with the `service` and `runtime-id` tags that are applied to these metrics.
