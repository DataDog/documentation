Correlating data by various Datadog products gives context to help estimate the business impact and find the root cause of an issue in a few clicks. Set up connections between incoming data to facilitate quick pivots in your explorers and dashboards.

## Connect Logs and Traces

Inject trace IDs into logs, and leverage unified service tagging to find the exact logs associated with a specific service and version, or all logs correlated to an observed trace. See [Connect Logs and Traces][1] to set it up.
