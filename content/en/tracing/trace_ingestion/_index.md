With Tracing without Limits™, the ingestion of traces to Datadog is fully customizable.

## Ingestion Mechanisms

Set up tracing to gain end-to-end visibility into your applications with fine-grained [ingestion configuration][1]. Make sure to capture complete traces, including all error and high-latency traces to never miss performance issues such as an application outage or an unresponsive service.

## Ingestion Control Page

The [Ingestion Controls Page][2] provides an overview of ingestion volumes and configuration settings across your services.
