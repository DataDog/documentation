With APM, both the **ingestion of traces** as well as the [retention][1] of those traces for 15 days are fully customizable.

To track or monitor your volume of ingested and indexed data, see [Usage Metrics][2].

## Ingestion mechanisms

Set up tracing to gain end-to-end visibility into your applications with fine-grained [ingestion configuration][3]. Make sure to capture complete traces, including all error and high-latency traces to never miss performance issues such as an application outage or an unresponsive service.

## Ingestion controls

The [Ingestion Control page][4] provides an overview of ingestion volumes and configuration settings across your services.
