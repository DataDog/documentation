## Overview

After you have set up your API Catalog with all the endpoints your organization has, and assigned team ownership, you can start managing and improving them, using the API Catalog as your jumping-off point for activities such as:

 - Detecting and investigating APIs that are under-performing.
 - Creating alerts based on key performance metrics such as latency and error rate.
 - Keeping track of an API's reliability in terms of triggered alerts, test results, and security signals.
 - Standardizing API testing and improving test coverage with Synthetic Monitoring.
