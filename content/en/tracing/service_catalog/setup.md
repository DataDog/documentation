## Overview

On the Service Catalog page, if the **Registered** column has a green check mark, the corresponding service has been registered with the catalog, and you can use the API to [update the service definition][1]. 

## For services that already send APM data

Any service that sends tracing data to Datadog APM is automatically listed in the Service Catalog. Until you register it, it shows a gray check mark when you hover over it.

To register the service and add ownership information, related links such as runbooks, and links to source code repositories, [update the service definition][1].

Go to [Service Catalog > Get Started][2] to get help forming valid JSON to post with the API.

## For all other services you want to catalog

If the service, API, or custom library you are interested in is not listed on the catalog page:

1. Go to [Get Started][2].

2. The **Register Services** form helps you generate JSON that you can post to Service Catalog API endpoint. Provide a service name in the `dd-service` field. Fill in ownership, source, and other service information in the Service Definition schema presented. Refer to the [full JSON schema on GitHub][3] for complete details.

3. Click the **Copy** button to copy the generated JSON. Send this as the `body` of a `POST` API call with the [Service Definition API][1].


## Discover services being reported in other Datadog telemetry data

To discover other services through existing Datadog telemetry such as infrastructure metrics, go to the **Discover Services** tab and follow instructions there. Discovery uses the `DD_SERVICE` [Unified Service Tagging convention][4] to locate services sending data to your Datadog organization.

## Store and edit service definitions in GitHub

Configure the [GitHub Apps integration][5] to directly link from where you view the service's definition in the Service Catalog to where it's stored and editable in GitHub.

To install the GitHub Apps integration, navigate to the [integration tile][6] and click **Link GitHub Account** in the **Repo Configuration** tab. 

### Service definition YAML files

Datadog scans for the `service.datadog.yaml` file at the root of each repository with read permissions. You can register multiple services in one YAML file by creating multiple YAML documents. Separate each document with three dashes (`---`).

### Modify service definition

When the GitHub Apps integration is set up for your service definitions, an **Edit in Github** button appears in the service's **Definition** tab and links you to GitHub to commit changes.

After you update the YAML files for your repositories, your changes propagate to the Service Catalog. 

To prevent accidental overwriting, create and modify your service definition files with either the GitHub Apps integration or the [Service Definition API endpoints][1]. Updating the same service using both the GitHub and the API could result in unintended overwriting.
