In the Delivery view in Service Catalog, you can view CI pipeline and static analysis results associated to your services.

By default, your service is associated to [CI pipeline(s)][4] through repository URL. 
You can edit the pipelines associated with each service by modifying the `ci-pipeline-fingerprints` field in your [service metadata][5].

To add or remove a pipeline associated to your service, click `Edit Metadata` in your service page, and go to Software Delivery. Please note that this is only available for [Service Catalog schema v2.2][7].

There are two ways to add or remove an associated pipeline:

1. Search for and select the pipelines you want to associate.

2. Add the pipeline fingerprint directly to the service metadata. You can locate a pipeline's fingerprint by clicking on a pipeline in the [Pipelines][6] page, then click the gear icon:
