## Overview

A service is an independent, deployable unit of software. Datadog [Unified Service Tagging][1] provides a standard way to manage and monitor service ownership consistently across every telemetry type. Service Catalog allows you to add user-defined service entries and manage metadata for existing services from APM, USM, and RUM. 

For more details about creating, getting, and deleting service definitions, see the [Service Definitions API reference][8].

## Service Definition Schema (v2)

The Service Definition Schema is a structure that contains basic information about a service. See the [full schema on GitHub][4].
