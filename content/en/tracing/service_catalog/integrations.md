## Overview

When you configure a service account for a [Datadog integration][10], you can incorporate metadata from your integrations into service definitions in the [Service Catalog][9]. You can also use autocomplete and validation features when editing a service definition in an [integrated development environment (IDE)](#ide-integrations).

## PagerDuty integration

You can add PagerDuty metadata to a service so that the Service Catalog displays and links to information such as who is on-call and whether there are active PagerDuty incidents for the service.

### Setup

You can connect any service in your [PagerDuty Service Directory][1]. You can map one PagerDuty service for each service in the Service Catalog.

1. If you have not already done so, set up the [Datadog PagerDuty integration][2].

2. Get your PagerDuty API access key as described in their [API Access Key][3] documentation.

3. Follow the [integration configuration instructions][4] to finish configuring it.

4. Update the service definition with the PagerDuty information. For example, pass in the following `integrations` configuration lines within the full [service definition][5]:

   ```
   ...
   integrations:
     pagerduty: https://www.pagerduty.com/service-directory/shopping-cart
   ...
   ```

## OpsGenie integration

You can add OpsGenie metadata to a service so that the Service Catalog displays and links to information such as who is on-call for the service.

### Setup

1. If you have not already done so, set up the [Datadog OpsGenie integration][12].
2. Get your OpsGenie API access key as described in their [API Key Management][13] documentation. This API key requires **configuration access** and **read** access rights.
3. Add an account in the **Accounts** section on the [integration tile][14], paste your OpsGenie API access key, and select the region for your OpsGenie account.

4. Update the service definition with the OpsGenie information to link your OpsGenie service with your Datadog service. For example, pass in the following `integrations` configuration lines within the full [service definition][5]:

   ```yaml
   "integrations": {
     "opsgenie": {
           "service-url": "https://www.opsgenie.com/service/123e4567-x12y-1234-a456-123456789000",
           "region": "US"
     }
   }
   ```

Once you've completed these steps, an **On Call** information box appears in the **Ownership** tab of a service in the Service Catalog.

## IDE integrations

Datadog provides a [JSON Schema][6] for service definitions so that when you are editing a service definition in a [supporting IDE][7], features such as autocomplete and validation are provided.

The [JSON schema for Datadog service definitions][8] is registered with the open source [Schema Store][7].
