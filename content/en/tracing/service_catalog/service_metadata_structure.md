## Overview

Service Catalog uses service definition schemas to store and display relevant metadata about your services. The schemas have built-in validation rules to ensure that only valid values are accepted and you can view warnings in the **Definition** tab on the side panel for any selected services. 

There are two supported versions of the schema:

- V2 is the earliest version, and contains some experimental features, such as `dd-team`, which are removed from v2.1.
- V2.1 supports additional UI elements such as service groupings and fields like `application`, `tier`, and `lifecycle`. `Application`, along with Teams, can be used as grouping variables in Service Catalog. `Lifecycle` helps you differentiate between `production`, `experimental`, or `deprecated` services to indicate development stages and apply different reliability and availability requirements. `Tier` indicates the criticality of services, to prioritize during incident triage. For example, `tier 1` typically represents the most critical services whose failure would result in severe customer impact, whereas `tier 4` services typically have no impacts on actual customer experience. 


For more information about the latest updates, see the schemas on GitHub.

## Service Definition Schema (v2.1)
