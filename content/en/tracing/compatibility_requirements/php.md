### Integrations

#### Web Framework Compatibility

By default, Datadog **supports all PHP web frameworks** out of the box, which allows you to see traces for spans of supported librariesâ€”for example: database and HTTP clients.

The following table enumerates some of the frameworks and versions Datadog successfully traces.

**Web frameworks**:

| Module         | Versions      | Support Type               |
|:---------------|:--------------|:---------------------------|
| CakePHP        | 2.x           | All supported PHP versions |
| CodeIgniter    | 2.x, 3.x      | PHP 7+                     |
| Laravel        | 4.2, 5.x, 6.x | All supported PHP versions |
| Lumen          | 5.2+          | All supported PHP versions |
| Slim           | 3.x           | All supported PHP versions |
| Symfony        | 3.3, 3.4, 4.x | All supported PHP versions |
| WordPress      | 4.x, 5.x      | PHP 7+                     |
| Zend Framework | 1.12          | All supported PHP versions |
| Yii            | 1.1, 2.0      | All supported PHP versions |
| Drupal         |               | All supported PHP versions |
| Magento        | 2             | All supported PHP versions |

| FuelPHP        | 1.1           | PHP 7+                     |

Note that even if you don't see your web framework in this list, it is supported out of the box with the latest release of the tracer.

Datadog is continuously adding more support for in-depth tracing for PHP web-frameworks.  To request support for additional span metadata and framework internals, contact our awesome [support team][2].

#### CLI Library Compatibility

Tracing from the CLI SAPI is disabled by default. To enable tracing of PHP CLI scripts, set `DD_TRACE_CLI_ENABLED=true`.

|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|
| CakePHP Console | 2.x      | Fully Supported |
