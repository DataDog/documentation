Datadog APM & Distributed Tracing gives deep visibility into your applications with **out-of-the-box performance dashboards** for web services, queues, and databases to monitor requests, errors, and latency. Distributed traces **seamlessly correlate** to browser sessions, logs, synthetic checks, network, processes, and infrastructure metrics across hosts, containers, proxies, and serverless functions. **Ingest 100% of your traces with no sampling**, search and analyze them live for the last 15 minutes, and use tag-based retention filters to keep traces that matter for your business for 15 days.

#### Tracing Without Limits: Journey of a Trace

{{< img src="tracing/live_search_and_analytics/tracing_without_limits_lifecycle-0.png" style="width:100%; background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" alt="Trace Journey" >}}

Traces start in your instrumented applications and flow into Datadog where we ingest 100% of traces up to 50 traces per second (per APM Host). If needed for high-throughput services, you can view and control the experience using [Ingestion Controls][1].  All ingested traces are available for live search and analytics for 15 minutes and you can use custom tag-based [retention filters][2] to keep exactly the traces that matter for your business for 15 days search and analytics.

## Getting Started

As you transition from monoliths to microservices, setting up Datadog APM across hosts, containers or serverless functions takes just minutes.

### 1. Configure the Datadog Agent

[Install and configure the Datadog Agent][3] in AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, ECS, Fargate, PCF, Heroku, on-prem and more.

### 2. Instrument Your Application

Add a tracing library to your application or proxy service to start sending traces to the Datadog Agent.

## Explore Datadog APM

Now that you've configured your application to send traces to Datadog, start getting insights into your application performance:

### Service Map

[Understand service dependencies][4] with an auto-generated service map from your traces alongside service performance metrics and monitor alert statuses.

### Service Performance Dashboards

[Monitor Service metrics][5] for requests, errors and latency percentiles.  Drill down into database queries or endpoints correlated with infrastructure.

{{< img src="tracing/index/ServicePage.gif" alt="Service Pages"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Live Search

[Search 100% of your traces][6] by any tag, live with no sampling, for 15 minutes.

{{< img src="tracing/live_search/LiveSearch.mp4" alt="Live Search" video="true" >}}

### Live Analytics

[Analyze performance by any tag on any span][7] live for 15 minutes during an outage to identify impacted users or transactions.

{{< img src="tracing/live_search/LiveAnalytics.mp4" alt="Live Analytics" video="true" >}}

### Trace Retention and Ingestion

[Retain the traces that matter most to you][8] with tag-based retention filters and perform analytics on all indexed spans for 15 days.

{{< img src="tracing/index/RetentionFilterTracingPage.png" alt="Trace Retention and Ingestion"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Deployment Tracking

[Monitor service performance][9] and compare between versions for rolling, blue/green, shadow, or canary deployments.

{{< img src="tracing/deployment_tracking/VersionComparison.png" alt="Versions on the Service Page"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Connect Logs and Distributed Traces

[View your application logs][10] side-by-side with the trace for a single distributed request with automatic trace-id injection.

{{< img src="tracing/index/ConnectLogsWithTraces.png" alt="Connect Logs And Traces"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Trace Serverless Functions

[Trace across AWS Lambda and hosts][11] to view complete traces across your hybrid infrastructure.

{{< img src="tracing/serverless_functions/ServerlessDistributedTrace.png" alt="Trace Serverless Functions"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Connect Synthetic Test Data and Traces

[Link simulated API tests][12] to traces to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network and backend requests.

{{< img src="tracing/index/Synthetics.gif" alt="Synthetic tests"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Continuous Profiler

[Improve code efficiency][13] with an always on production profiler to pinpoint the lines of code consuming the most CPU, memory, or I/O.

{{< img src="tracing/index/Profiling.png" alt="Profiling"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Customize your Instrumentation or add OpenTracing

[Seamlessly connect your instrumentation][14] between automatic instrumentation, dd-trace-api, OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry exporters.
