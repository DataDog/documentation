Datadog APM & Continuous Profiler gives deep visibility into your applications with **out-of-the-box performance dashboards** for web services, queues, and databases to monitor requests, errors, and latency. Distributed traces **seamlessly correlate** to browser sessions, logs, profiles, synthetic checks, network, processes, and infrastructure metrics across hosts, containers, proxies, and serverless functions. Navigate directly from investigating a slow trace to **identifying the specific line of code** causing performance bottlenecks with code hotspots.

#### Tracing Without Limits: journey of a trace

{{< img src="tracing/live_search_and_analytics/tracing_without_limits_lifecycle-0.png" style="width:100%; background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" alt="Trace Journey" >}}

Traces start in your instrumented applications and flow into Datadog where we ingest 100% of traces up to 50 traces per second (per APM Host). If needed for high-throughput services, you can view and control the experience using [Ingestion Controls][1].  All ingested traces are available for live search and analytics for 15 minutes and you can use custom tag-based [retention filters][2] to keep exactly the traces that matter for your business for 15 days search and analytics.

## Send traces to Datadog

As you transition from monoliths to microservices, setting up Datadog APM across hosts, containers or serverless functions takes just minutes.

[Add the Datadog Tracing Library][3] to find instructions for your environment and language, whether you are [tracing a proxy][4] or tracing across [AWS Lambda functions][5] and hosts, using automatic instrumentation, dd-trace-api, [OpenTracing, or OpenTelemetry][6].

## Explore Datadog APM

Now that you've configured your application to send traces to Datadog, start getting insights into your application performance:

### Service map

[Understand service dependencies][7] with an auto-generated service map from your traces alongside service performance metrics and monitor alert statuses.

### Service performance dashboards

[Monitor Service metrics][8] for requests, errors and latency percentiles.  Drill down into database queries or endpoints correlated with infrastructure.

### Continuous Profiler

[Improve application latency][9] and optimize compute resources with always on production profiling to pinpoint the lines of code consuming the most CPU, memory, or I/O.

{{< img src="tracing/index/Profiling.png" alt="Profiling"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Live search

[Search 100% of your traces][10] by any tag, live with no sampling, for 15 minutes.

{{< img src="tracing/live_search/LiveSearch.mp4" alt="Live Search" video="true" >}}

### Live analytics

[Analyze performance by any tag on any span][11] live for 15 minutes during an outage to identify impacted users or transactions.

{{< img src="tracing/live_search/LiveAnalytics.mp4" alt="Live Analytics" video="true" >}}

### Deployment tracking

[Monitor service performance][12] and compare between versions for rolling, blue/green, shadow, or canary deployments.

{{< img src="tracing/deployment_tracking/VersionComparison.png" alt="Versions on the Service Page"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Trace retention and ingestion

[Retain the traces that matter most to you][13] with tag-based retention filters and perform analytics on all indexed spans for 15 days.

{{< img src="tracing/index/RetentionFilterTracingPage.png" alt="Trace Retention and Ingestion"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Generate custom metrics from all spans

[Generate metrics][14] with 15-month retention from all ingested spans to create and monitor key business and performance indicators.

{{< img src="tracing/index/SpantoMetricsPreview.png" alt="Generate Custom Metrics from ingested spans"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Connect logs and distributed traces

[View your application logs][15] side-by-side with the trace for a single distributed request with automatic trace-id injection.

{{< img src="tracing/index/ConnectLogsWithTraces.png" alt="Connect Logs And Traces"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Connect Real User Monitoring and traces

[Link between real user sessions][16] and traces to see the exact traces that correspond to user experiences and reported issues.

{{< img src="tracing/index/RumTraces.gif" alt="Connect RUM sessions and traces"  style="width:100%;">}}

### Connect synthetic test data and traces

[Link simulated API tests][17] to traces to find the root cause of failures across frontend, network and backend requests.
