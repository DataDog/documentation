Datadog APM & Distributed Tracing gives deep visibility into your applications with **out-of-the-box performance dashboards** for web services, queues and databases to monitor requests, errors and latency. Distributed traces **seamlessly correlate** to Browser sessions, Logs, Network, Processes and Infrastructure metrics across hosts, containers, proxies and serverless functions. Search **100% of traces live with no sampling** during an outage, while Datadog intelligently retains traces that represent an error, high latency or unique code paths for analysis.

## Getting Started

As you transition from monoliths to microservices, setting up Datadog APM across hosts, containers or serverless functions takes just minutes.

### 1. Configure the Datadog Agent

[Install and configure the Datadog Agent][1] in AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, ECS, Fargate, PCF, Heroku, on-prem and more.

### 2. Instrument Your Application

Add a tracing library to your application or proxy service to start sending traces to the Datadog Agent.

## Explore Datadog APM

Now that you've configured your application to send traces to Datadog, start getting insights into your application performance:


### App Analytics

[Analyze performance][2] by application, infrastructure or custom tags such as datacenter, availability zone, deployment version, domain, user, checkout amount, customer and more.

### Connect Logs and Traces

[View your application logs][3] side-by-side with the trace for a single distributed request with automatic trace-id injection.

### Continuous Profiling

[Improve code efficiency][4] with always on production profiling to pinpoint the lines of code consuming the most CPU, memory, or I/O.

### Live Tail

[Search by any tag][5] on 100% of your traces live with no sampling.

### Integrate with OpenTracing

[Integrate your instrumentation][6] seamlessly between Opentracing and Datadog APM.
