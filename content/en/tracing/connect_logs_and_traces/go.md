## Automatic Trace ID injection

Coming Soon. Reach out to [the Datadog support team][1] to learn more.

## Manual Trace ID injection

The Go tracer exposes two API calls to allow printing [trace][2] and [span][3] identifiers along with log statements using exported methods from `SpanContext` type:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1/ddtrace/tracer"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Create a span for a web request at the /posts URL.
    span := tracer.StartSpan("web.request", tracer.ResourceName("/posts"))
    defer span.Finish()

    // Retrieve Trace ID and Span ID
    traceID := span.Context().TraceID()
    spanID := span.Context().SpanID()

    // Append them to log messages as fields:
    log.Printf("my log message dd.trace_id=%d dd.span_id=%d", traceID, spanID)
}
```

The above example illustrates how to use the span's context in the standard library's `log` package. Similar logic may be applied to 3rd party packages too.

**Note**: If you are not using a [Datadog Log Integration][4] to parse your logs, custom log parsing rules need to ensure that `dd.trace_id` and `dd.span_id` are being parsed as strings. More information can be found in the [FAQ on this topic][5].
