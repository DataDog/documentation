The correlation between Datadog APM and Datadog Log Management is improved by the injection of trace IDs, span IDs, `env`, `service`, and `version` as attributes in your logs. With these fields you can find the exact logs associated with a specific service and version, or all logs correlated to an observed [trace][1].

It is recommended to configure your application's tracer with `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`, and `DD_VERSION`. This will provide the best experience for adding `env`, `service`, and `version`. See the [unified service tagging][2] documentation for more details.

**Note**: The Java, PHP and Go Tracer do not currently support configuration of unified service tagging for logs.

Before correlating traces with logs, ensure your logs are either sent as JSON, or [parsed by the proper language level log processor][3]. Your language level logs _must_ be turned into Datadog attributes in order for traces and logs correlation to work.
