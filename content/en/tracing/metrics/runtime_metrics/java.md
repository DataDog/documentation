## Automatic configuration

JVM metrics collection is enabled by default for Java tracer v0.29.0+. It can be disabled with one configuration parameter in the tracing client, either through a system property, `-Ddd.jmxfetch.enabled=false`, or through an environment variable, `DD_JMXFETCH_ENABLED=false`. As of v0.64.0+, you can also use the `DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED=false` environment variable to disable it.

JVM metrics can be viewed in correlation with your Java services. See the [Service Catalog][1] in Datadog.

By default, runtime metrics from your application are sent to the Datadog Agent with DogStatsD over port `8125`. Make sure that [DogStatsD is enabled for the Agent][2].

If you are running the Agent as a container, ensure that `DD_DOGSTATSD_NON_LOCAL_TRAFFIC` [is set to true][3], and that port `8125` is open on the Agent. Additionally, for:

- **Kubernetes**: You _must_ [bind the DogstatsD port to a host port][4].
- **ECS**: [Set the appropriate flags in your task definition][5].

Alternatively, the Agent can ingest metrics with a Unix Domain Socket (UDS) as an alternative to UDP transport. For more information, read [DogStatsD over Unix Domain Socket][10].

**Notes**:

- For the runtime UI, `dd-trace-java` >= [`0.24.0`][6] is supported.
- To associate JVM metrics within flame graphs, ensure the `env: tag` (case-sensitive) is set and matching across your environment.
- For JVM metrics to appear on the service page when using Fargate, ensure that `DD_DOGSTATSD_TAGS` is set on your Agent task, and matches the `env: tag` of that service.

## Data Collected

The following metrics are collected by default per JVM process after enabling JVM metrics.

Along with displaying these metrics in your APM Service Page, Datadog provides a [default JVM Runtime Dashboard][7].

Additional JMX metrics can be added using configuration files that are passed on using `dd.jmxfetch.config.dir` and `dd.jmxfetch.config`. You can also enable existing Datadog JMX integrations individually with the `dd.jmxfetch.<INTEGRATION_NAME>.enabled=true` parameter. This auto-embeds configuration from Datadog's [existing JMX configuration files][8]. See the [JMX Integration][9] for further details on configuration.
