## Automatic configuration

To enable Go runtime metrics collection, start the tracer using the `WithRuntimeMetrics` option:

```go
tracer.Start(tracer.WithRuntimeMetrics())
```

View runtime metrics in correlation with your Go services on the [Service Catalog][1] in Datadog.

By default, runtime metrics from your application are sent every 10 seconds to the Datadog Agent with DogStatsD. Make sure that [DogStatsD is enabled for the Agent][2]. If your Datadog Agent DogStatsD address differs from the default `localhost:8125`, use the [`WithDogstatsdAddress`][3] option (available starting in 1.18.0) or the environment variables `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT`.

If `WithDogstatsdAddress` is not used, the tracer attempts to determine the address of the statsd service according to the following rules:
  1. Look for `/var/run/datadog/dsd.socket` and use it if present. IF NOT, continue to #2.
  2. The host is determined by `DD_AGENT_HOST`, and defaults to "localhost".
  3. The port is retrieved from the Agent. If not present, it is determined by `DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT`, and defaults to `8125`.

If you are running the Agent as a container, ensure that `DD_DOGSTATSD_NON_LOCAL_TRAFFIC` [is set to true][4], and that port `8125` is open on the Agent. Additionally, for Kubernetes or ECS, follow the guidelines below:

- **Kubernetes**: You _must_ [bind the DogstatsD port to a host port][5].
- **ECS**: [Set the appropriate flags in your task definition][6].

Alternatively, the Agent can ingest metrics with a Unix Domain Socket (UDS) as an alternative to UDP transport. For more information, read [DogStatsD over Unix Domain Socket][8].

## Data Collected

The following metrics are collected by default after enabling Go metrics.

Along with displaying these metrics in your APM Service Page, Datadog provides a [default Go Runtime Dashboard][7].
