To use APM, start by sending your [traces][1] to Datadog, and then [configure your environment](#configure-your-environment). You can send traces to Datadog in multiple different ways depending on your system setup: including using the [Datadog Agent locally](#datadog-agent), [on containers](#containers), and [several other ways](#additional-environments). For the full overview of all of the steps to set up APM, see the [APM overview][2].

## Datadog Agent

APM is enabled by default in Agent 6. If you are sending traces from a nonlocal environment (like a container), set `apm_non_local_traffic: true` in your main [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][3].

To get an overview of all the possible settings for APM, take a look at the Agent's [`datadog.example.yaml` configuration file][4]. For all of the metrics sent to Datadog by the Agent, see [APM metrics sent by the Datadog Agent][5]. For more information about the Datadog Agent, see the [Agent documentation][6] or refer to the [`datadog.yaml` configuration template][4].

## Containers

See the specific setup instructions to ensure that the Agent is configured to receive traces in a containerized environment:

</br>
Note: After having instrumented your application, the tracing client sends traces to `localhost:8126` by default.

## Serverless

### AWS Lambda

For more information setting up Lambda - X-Ray, see the [Amazon X-Ray integration documentation][7]

### Google App Engine, AAS

Datadog APM requires sending trace data to a running Agent. A workaround for enabling trace collection for a serverless setup is to configure a separate VM that accepts trace traffic externally.

## Additional environments

There are alternatives to the Agent and containers that you can use to collect traces.

### Heroku

Tracing is enabled by default when monitoring with Heroku. For more information about configuring tracing for Heroku, see the [Heroku cloud documentation][8].

### Cloud Foundry

Tracing is enabled by default when monitoring with Cloud Foundry. For more information about configuring tracing for Cloud Foundry, see the [Cloud Foundry documentation][9].

## Configure your environment

There are several ways to specify [an environment][10] when reporting data:

1. **Host tag**: Use a host tag with the format `env:<ENVIRONMENT>` to tag all traces from that Agent accordingly.
2. **Agent configuration**: Override the default tag used by the Agent in the Agent configuration file. This tags all traces coming through the Agent, overriding the host tag value.

  ```
  apm_config:
  env: <ENVIRONMENT>
  ```

3. **Per trace**: When submitting a single [trace][1], specify an environment by tagging one of its [spans][11] with the metadata key `env`. This overrides the Agent configuration and the host tagâ€™s value (if any). Consult the [trace tagging documentation][12] to learn how to assign a tag to your traces.

## Next steps

Next, [Instrument your application][13]. For the full overview of all of the steps to set up APM, see the [APM overview][2].
