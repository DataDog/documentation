Google Cloud Run is a fully managed compute platform that lets you run stateless containers and serverless functions with automatic scaling, built-in load balancing, and pay-only-for-what-you-use billing.

Datadog provides monitoring and log collection for Cloud Run through the [Google Cloud integration][1].
