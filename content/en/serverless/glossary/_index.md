### General serverless concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Serverless          | A development model in which a cloud provider allocates backend resources on demand. This paradigm enables developers to build, run, and deploy applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.                              |
| Function          | In a serverless paradigm, a function is a self-contained application that runs in the cloud.                             |
| Cloud-based development          | A workflow where developers run their code in the cloud during the development process, instead of just on their local machines. Generally, building serverless applications requires cloud-based development.                                |
| Cold start          | The first time you invoke a particular function, it may take a longer time to run than in subsequent invocations. This phenomenon is known as a cold start, and may be caused by different factors: for instance, the cloud provider may need some time to provision underlying resources.                                |
| Event-driven architecture          | An architectural pattern in which events drive communication between decoupled services.                                 |
| Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)          | A subset of serverless functions. FaaS refers explicitly to event-driven paradigms.                               |

## Cloud-specific concepts

{{% tab "AWS Lambda" %}}

AWS Lambda is the FaaS platform provided by Amazon Web Services. See the [AWS Lambda documentation][1] for more details.

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon Resource Name (ARN)         | A naming convention for resources in AWS.                              |
| AWS CloudFormation          | An AWS service that uses templates to create and delete AWS resources. You can create and delete collections of resources as a unit; these collections are called "stacks."                               |
| AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)         | An AWS service for managing users and user permissions in AWS.                       |
| AWS Lambda          | AWS's FaaS offering. Alternately, "a Lambda" is often used as a shorthand for "a Lambda function".                      |
| Step Functions          | Step Functions is a service provided by AWS which offers a way of orchestrating common workflows composed of multiple Lambda functions or cloud service events, without needing to write plumbing code to handle the workflow state and retry logic, etc.                     |
| Deployment package | Lambda function code can be deployed using a deployment package: either a ZIP archive that contains the function code and dependencies, or a container image that is compatible with the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)][2] specification. |
| Edge location         | An AWS data center used to perform service-specific operations.                      |
| Event | A JSON document that contains data for a Lambda function to process. |
| Lambda function | A serverless function in Lambda. Each function had code to process events and can be invoked to run. |
| Lambda layer | A ZIP archive that contains additional codeâ€”for example, libraries, a custom runtime, configuration files, or other dependencies. You can use Lambda layers to use libraries in your serverless functions without having to include these libraries in your deployment package. |
| Managed policy | An IAM policy that can be attached to multiple users, groups, and roles. These can be created and managed by AWS or by a customer.|
| Resource | An S3 bucket, EC2 instance, IAM user, or other entity that can be used in AWS. |
| Resource property| When including a resource in an AWS CloudFormation stack, each resource can have one or more associated properties. |
| Serverless Application Model (SAM)          | SAM is an Infrastructure as Code framework developed by AWS specifically focused on serverless applications.                                |



### Datadog serverless for AWS Lambda concepts

| Concept                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Enhanced Lambda metrics][3] | Enhanced Lambda metrics give you a view above and beyond the default Lambda metrics enabled with the AWS Lambda integration. These metrics are distinguished by being in the `aws.lambda.enhanced.*` namespace, and are Datadog's best practice for setting real-time monitors on your serverless application health.|
| [Lambda library][4]       | The Datadog Lambda library collects data (such as enhanced Lambda metrics and traces) from your Lambda function runtime. The Lambda library then submits this data either to logs (for the [Forwarder][5] to pick up) or to the [Lambda extension][6]. The Datadog Lambda library is often bundled together with the Datadog tracing library into a [Lambda layer][7] for easy installation.                          |
| [Forwarder][5]          | An AWS Lambda function that parses and ships serverless monitoring data from CloudWatch logs to Datadog.                             |
| [Lambda extension][6] | A lightweight Datadog Agent that runs within the Lambda execution environment and ships serverless monitoring data to Datadog with minimal performance overhead. The extension is distributed as a [Lambda layer][7] for easy installation. |
| [Serverless CLI][8] | The CLI enables instrumentation by modifying existing Lambda functions' configuration. It is the quickest way to get started with Datadog serverless monitoring. |
| [Serverless Macro][9] | The Datadog Serverless CloudFormation macro automatically enables instrumentation for serverless applications by transforming the CloudFormation template.|
| [Serverless Plugin][10] | The Serverless plugin automatically enables instrumentation for your applications managed by the [Serverless Framework][11] by modifying the Lambda functions' configuration. |
| [Serverless CDK Construct][12] | The Serverless plugin automatically enables instrumentation for your applications managed by the [AWS CDK][13] by modifying the Lambda functions' configuration. |
| [Trace merging][14] | Serverless trace merging is required to see a single, connected trace when you configure both Datadog's tracing libraries (`dd-trace`) and AWS X-Ray tracing libraries in your application. |
| [Trace propagation][15] | The Datadog trace context needs to be propagated over AWS managed services, such as SQS, Kinesis and Lambda functions, to generate a single, connected trace for serverless applications. |
| [Serverless Insights][16] | Datadog automatically generates suggestions to resolve errors and performance problems and optimizes cost for your serverless applications. |
