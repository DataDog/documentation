## Required setup

If not already configured:

- Install the [AWS integration][1]. This allows Datadog to ingest Lambda metrics from AWS. 
- Install the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][2], which is required to ingest AWS Lambda traces, enhanced metrics, custom metrics, and logs. 

After you have installed the [AWS integration][1] and the [Datadog Forwarder][2], follow these steps to instrument your application to send metrics, logs, and traces to Datadog.

## Configuration

### Configure the function

1. Enable [AWS X-Ray active tracing][3] for your Lambda function.
2. Install the [AWS X-Ray SDK for .NET][4].

### Subscribe the Datadog Forwarder to the log groups

You need to subscribe the Datadog Forwarder Lambda function to each of your functionâ€™s log groups to send metrics, traces, and logs to Datadog.

1. [Install the Datadog Forwarder if you haven't][2].
2. [Subscribe the Datadog Forwarder to your function's log groups][5].

### Unified service tagging

Although it's optional, Datadog highly recommends tagging you serverless applications with the `env`, `service`, and `version` tags following the [unified service tagging documentation][6].

## Explore Datadog serverless monitoring

After you have configured your function following the steps above, you should be able to view metrics, logs and traces on the [Serverless homepage][7].

## Monitor custom business logic

If you would like to submit a custom metric, see the sample code below:

```csharp
var myMetric = new Dictionary<string, object>();
myMetric.Add("m", "coffee_house.order_value");
myMetric.Add("v", 12.45);
myMetric.Add("e", (int)(DateTime.UtcNow - new DateTime(1970, 1, 1)).TotalSeconds);
myMetric.Add("t", new string[] {"product:latte", "order:online"});
LambdaLogger.Log(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myMetric));
```

For more information on custom metric submission, see [here][8].
