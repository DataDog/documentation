## Overview

Azure App Services generates two distinct types of logs that can be collected and monitored in Datadog:

### Platform Logs vs Application Logs

**Platform Logs** (Azure Infrastructure)
- Generated by Azure App Service infrastructure
- Include resource metrics, diagnostic events, and platform-level information
- Collected via Azure Diagnostic Settings
- Examples: App Service plan metrics, scaling events, platform errors

**Application Logs** (Your Code)
- Generated by your instrumented application code
- Include business logic, user interactions, and application-specific events
- Collected via Datadog APM, integrations, or manual configuration
- Examples: HTTP requests, database queries, custom business events

## Log Collection Setup

### Platform Logs Setup

Platform logs are collected through the [Azure integration][1] and [Azure log forwarding][2]:

1. **Configure Azure Diagnostic Settings** to forward platform logs to:
   - Azure Event Hub (recommended)
   - Azure Blob Storage
   - Azure Log Analytics

2. **Set up Azure log forwarding** to automatically collect and send logs to Datadog

### Application Logs Setup

Application logs are collected through Datadog instrumentation and depend on your runtime.

**Environment Variables for All Languages**

Set these environment variables in your Azure App Service Application Settings:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DD_SOURCE` | Identifies the log source for proper processing | `csharp` |
| `DD_SERVICE` | Your application's service name | `my-web-app` |
| `DD_ENV` | Your application's environment | `production`, `staging`, `development` |

**Language-Specific Configuration**

| Runtime | Log Collection Method | Documentation |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| .NET | Built-in logging with trace correlation | [.NET Log Collection][3] |
| Java | Logback, Log4j, or JUL with trace correlation | [Java Log Collection][4] |
| Node.js | Winston, Bunyan, or console with trace correlation | [Node.js Log Collection][5] |
| Python | Logging module with trace correlation | [Python Log Collection][6] |
| PHP | Monolog, error_log, or syslog with trace correlation | [PHP Log Collection][7] |

**Operating System Comparison**

**Windows App Service**
- Logs not natively supported in extension
- Various runtime specific agentless logging solutions
- Datadog extension enables log trace correlation via APM

**Linux App Service**
- Uses sidecar container approach for APM and log collection
- Supports multiple runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET, PHP)
- Logs written to `/home/LogFiles/` directory
- Sidecar container tails log files for collection

**Container App Service**
- Uses sidecar container with custom container images
- Supports any runtime that can run in containers
- Logs written to stdout/stderr or mounted volumes
- Sidecar container collects logs from container stream

## Expected Behavior in Datadog UI

**Platform Logs**
- Appear in the **Logs** section with `source:azure` and `service:azure-app-service`
- Include Azure resource metadata and platform metrics
- Can be correlated with Azure App Service metrics

**Application Logs**
- Appear in the **Logs** section with your configured `service` and `source`
- Include trace correlation when `DD_LOGS_INJECTION` is enabled
- Can be correlated with APM traces and custom metrics

## Troubleshooting Log Collection

**Common Issues and Solutions**

| Issue | Platform Logs | Application Logs | Solution |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| No logs appearing | Check Azure Diagnostic Settings | Check Application Logging setting | Verify forwarding configuration |
| Missing trace correlation | Not applicable | Check `DD_LOGS_INJECTION` setting | Enable trace-log correlation |
| Incorrect service names | Not applicable | Check `DD_SERVICE` environment variable | Set correct service name |
| Log parsing issues | Check Azure log format | Check language-specific log format | Verify log format compatibility |

For detailed troubleshooting steps, see the [language-specific setup guides][8] in the main Azure App Service documentation.
