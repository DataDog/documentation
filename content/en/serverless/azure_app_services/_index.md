## Overview

Microsoft [Azure App Service][1] is a group of serverless resources that enable you to build and host web apps, mobile backends, event-driven functions, and RESTful APIs without managing infrastructure. It can host workloads of all sizes and offers auto-scaling and high availability options.

Datadog provides monitoring capabilities for all Azure App Service resource types:

- Azure Monitor metrics for [Apps][2] and [Functions][3] using the [Azure Integration][2].
- Use the [Azure App Service View][4] to quickly spot issues, map relationships between your Azure App Service resources, and gain insights into cost and performance.
- Submit custom metrics through the API.
- Submit [resource logs][5] through [Event Hub][6].

Datadog provides additional monitoring capabilities for the following Azure App Service workload runtimes on Basic, Standard, and Premium plans:

| OS | Runtime |Status|Documentation| 
|----|---------|----|----|
|Windows|.NET|GA|[Windows .NET setup][7]|
|Windows|Java|Beta|[Windows Java setup][8]|
|Linux|.NET|Beta|[Linux docs][9]|
|Linux|Node|Beta|[Linux docs][9]|

Capabilities:
- Fully distributed APM tracing using automatic instrumentation
- Customized APM service and trace views showing relevant Azure App Service metrics and metadata
- Manual APM instrumentation to customize spans
- `Trace_ID` injection into application logs
- Custom metrics with [DogStatsD][7]
