This page explains how to [redrive][1] executions directly from Datadog to continue failed AWS Step Functions from the point of failure without a state machine restart.

## Enable redrive within Datadog
To enable using redrive within Datadog, configure an [AWS Connection][3] with [Datadog App Builder][4]. Ensure that your IAM roles include permissions that allow executing a Step Function for the retry action (`StartExecution`) or redriving a Step Function for the redrive action (`RedriveExecution`).

## Usage
To take action on a Step Function in Datadog: 
1. Go to the [Step Functions][2] page. 
2. Find the Step Function you wish to redrive.
3. Open this Step Function's side panel. On the **Executions** tab, locate the failed execution you wish to redrive.
4. Click on the **Failed** pill to open a redrive modal.
5. Click the **Redrive** button.

## Tracing redrives
When monitoring redriven executions, use the Waterfall view, as the large gap between the original execution and redrive can make the Flame Graph view imperceptible.

### Troubleshooting missing redrive traces
If a redrive is triggered within one minute of the original execution's failure, its corresponding trace may not appear.

Also, a redrive may not always share the same sampling decision as the original execution. To ensure that the redriven execution is also sampled, you can reference the `@redrive:true` span tag in a retention query.
