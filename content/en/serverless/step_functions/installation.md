### Requirements
* The full Step Function execution length must be less than 15 minutes for full traces.
* Linked Lambda traces are supported for Node.js (layer v94+) and Python (layer v75+) runtimes.

### Setup

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Serverless Framework" %}}

For developers using [Serverless Framework][4] to deploy serverless applications, use the Datadog Serverless Framework Plugin.

1. If you have not already, install the [Datadog Serverless Framework Plugin][1] v5.40.0+:

    ```shell
    serverless plugin install --name serverless-plugin-datadog
    ```

2. Ensure you have deployed the [Datadog Lambda Forwarder][2], a Lambda function that ships logs from AWS to Datadog, and that you are using v3.74.0+. You may need to [update your Forwarder][5].

   Take note of your Forwarder's ARN.

3. Add the following to your `serverless.yml`:

    ```yaml
    custom:
      datadog:
        site: <DATADOG_SITE>
        apiKeySecretArn: <DATADOG_API_KEY_SECRET_ARN>
        forwarderArn: <FORWARDER_ARN>
        enableStepFunctionTracing: true
    ```
    - Replace `<DATADOG_SITE>` with {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} (ensure the correct SITE is selected on the right).
    - Replace `<DATADOG_API_KEY_SECRET_ARN>` with the ARN of the AWS secret where your [Datadog API key][3] is securely stored. The key needs to be stored as a plaintext string (not a JSON blob). The `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission is required. For quick testing, you can instead use `apiKey` and set the Datadog API key in plaintext.
    - Replace `<FORWARDER_ARN>` with the ARN of your Datadog Lambda Forwarder, as noted previously.

    For additional settings, see [Datadog Serverless Framework Plugin - Configuration parameters][7].

4. For Node.js and Python runtimes, set `mergeStepFunctionAndLambdaTraces:true` in your `serverless.yaml` file. This links your Step Function traces with Lambda traces. If you have not instrumented your Lambda functions to send traces, you can [follow the steps to add the Lambda layer for your preferred runtime][8].

{{% tab "Datadog CLI" %}}
1. If you have not already, install the [Datadog CLI][1] v2.18.0+.

   ```shell
   npm install -g @datadog/datadog-ci
   ```
2. Ensure you have deployed the [Datadog Lambda Forwarder][2], a Lambda function that ships logs from AWS to Datadog, and that you are using v3.74.0+. You may need to [update your Forwarder][3].

   Take note of your Forwarder's ARN.
3. Instrument your Step Function.

   ```shell
   datadog-ci stepfunctions instrument --step-function <STEP_FUNCTION_ARN> --forwarder <FORWARDER_ARN>
   ```
   - Replace `<STEP_FUNCTION_ARN>` with the ARN of your Step Function.
   - Replace `<FORWARDER_ARN>` with the ARN of your Datadog Lambda Forwarder, as noted previously.

   For more information about the `datadog-ci stepfunctions` command, see the [Datadog CLI documentation][5].

4. For Node.js and Python runtimes, add the flag `--mergeStepFunctionAndLambdaTraces` in your command. This links your Step Function traces with Lambda traces. If you have not yet instrumented your Lambda functions to send traces, you can [follow the steps to add the Lambda layer for your preferred runtime][6].

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Custom" %}}

1. Enable all logging for your Step Function. In your AWS console, open your state machine. Click *Edit* and find the Logging section. There, set *Log level* to `ALL` and enable the *Include execution data* checkbox.
   {{< img src="serverless/step_functions/aws_log.png" alt="AWS UI, Logging section, showing log level set to ALL." style="width:100%;" >}}

2. Ensure you have deployed the [Datadog Lambda Forwarder][1], a Lambda function that ships logs from AWS to Datadog, and that you are using v3.74.0+. You may need to [update your Forwarder][2].

   Take note of your Forwarder's ARN.

3. Subscribe CloudWatch logs to the Datadog Lambda Forwarder. To do this, you have two options:
   - **Datadog-AWS integration** (recommended)
     1. Ensure that you have set up the [Datadog-AWS integration][4].
     2. In Datadog, open the [AWS integration tile][5], and view the *Configuration* tab.
     3. On the left, select the AWS account where your Step Function is running. Open the *Log Collection* tab.
     4. In the *Log Autosubscription* section, under *Autosubscribe Forwarder Lambda Functions*, enter the ARN of your Datadog Lambda Forwarder, as noted previously. Click *Add*.
     5. Toggle on *Step Functions CloudWatch Logs*. Changes take 15 minutes to take effect.

     **Note**: Log Autosubscription requires your Lambda Forwarder and Step Function to be in the same region.

   - **Manual**
     1. Ensure that your log group name has the prefix `/aws/vendedlogs/states`. 
     2. Open your AWS console and go to your Datadog Lambda Forwarder. In the *Function overview* section, click on *Add trigger*.
     3. Under *Add trigger*, in the *Trigger configuration* section, use the *Select a source* dropdown to select `CloudWatch Logs`.
     4. Under *Log group*, select the log group for your state machine. For example, `/aws/vendedlogs/states/my-state-machine`.
     5. Enter a filter name. You can choose to name it "empty filter" and leave the *Filter pattern* box blank.

<div class="alert alert-warning"> If you are using a different instrumentation method such as Serverless Framework or datadog-ci, enabling autosubscription may create duplicated logs. Choose one configuration method to avoid this behavior.</a>.</div>


4. Enable tracing on your Step Function by adding a `DD_TRACE_ENABLED` tag. Set the value to `true`.
5. Set up tags. Open your AWS console and go to your Step Functions state machine. Open the *Tags* section and add `env:<ENV_NAME>` and `service:<SERVICE_NAME>` tags. The `env` tag is required to see traces in Datadog, and it defaults to `dev`. The `service` tag defaults to the state machine's name.
6. For Node.js and Python runtimes, you can link your Step Function traces to Lambda traces. On the Lambda Task, set the `Parameters` key with the following: 

   ```json
   "Parameters": {
     "Payload.$": "States.JsonMerge($$, $, false)",
     ...
   }
   ```

   The `JsonMerge` [intrinsic function][6] merges the [Step Functions context object][7] (`$$`) with the original Lambda's input payload (`$`). Fields of the original payload overwrite the Step Functions context object if their keys are the same.

**Example**:

{{< highlight json "hl_lines=4-7" >}}
"Lambda Read From DynamoDB": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke",
      "Parameters": {
        "Payload.$": "States.JsonMerge($$, $, false)",
        "FunctionName": "${lambdaArn}"
      },
      "End": true
    }
{{< /highlight >}}

Alternatively, if you have business logic defined in the payload, you could also use the following:

{{< highlight json "hl_lines=8-10" >}}
"Lambda Read From DynamoDB": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke",
      "Parameters": {
        "Payload": {
          ...
          "Execution.$": "$$.Execution",
          "State.$": "$$.State",
          "StateMachine.$": "$$.StateMachine"
        },
        "FunctionName": "${lambdaArn}"
      },
      "End": true
    }
{{< /highlight >}}

If you have not yet instrumented your Lambda functions to send traces, you can [follow the steps to add the Lambda layer for your preferred runtime][3].

## See your Step Function metrics, logs, and traces in Datadog

After you have invoked your state machine, go to the [**Serverless app**][2] in Datadog. Search for `service:<YOUR_STATE_MACHINE_NAME>` to see the relevant metrics, logs, and traces associated with that state machine. If you set the `service` tag on your state machine to a custom value, search for `service:<CUSTOM_VALUE>`.

{{< img src="serverless/step_functions/overview1.png" alt="An AWS Step Function side panel view." style="width:100%;" >}}

If you cannot see your traces, see [Troubleshooting][5].
