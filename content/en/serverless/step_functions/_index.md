AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets developers create and manage multi-step application workflows. In addition to getting Cloudwatch metrics from Datadog's [AWS Step Functions integration][2], Datadog also provides native AWS Step Function monitoring and tracing.

Serverless Monitoring for AWS Step Functions enables you to:
- Get an overview of the state of all of your Step Functions in one unified app view
- View end-to-end traces for a single Step Function execution and its associated logs and metrics
- Monitor associated Lambda function and view linked Lambda traces
- Set monitors on a certain trace, metric, log error, or anomaly associated with a Step Function

To get started, follow the [installation instructions][1].
