# Compatibility

Datadog's tracing libraries (`dd-trace`) are known to be not compatible with [webpack][1] due to the use of conditional imports and other issues. While webpack cannot build `dd-trace`, your application can still use the `dd-trace` and `datadog-lambda-js` libraries provided by the prebuilt Datadog Lambda layer. Follow the instructions below:

1. Follow the [installation instructions for Node.js][2] and ensure the Datadog Lambda layer is added to your Lambda function. 
2. Mark `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` as [externals][3] for webpack. This tells webpack to skip building them as dependencies, since they are already available in the Lambda runtime provided by the Datadog Lambda layer.

    **webpack.config.js**

    ```
    var nodeExternals = require("webpack-node-externals");

    module.exports = {
      // we use webpack-node-externals to excludes all node deps.
      // You can manually set the externals too.
      externals: [nodeExternals(), "dd-trace", "datadog-lambda-js"],
    };
    ```

3. Remove `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` from your `package.json` and the build process.
4. If you are using `serverless-webpack` and the Serverless Framework, exclude `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` from your `serverless.yml`.

    **serverless.yml**

    ```
    custom:
      webpack:
        includeModules:
          forceExclude:
            - dd-trace
            - datadog-lambda-js
    ```
