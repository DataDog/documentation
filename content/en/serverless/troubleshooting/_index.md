If you have not yet configured serverless monitoring, go to the dedicated page for [installation instructions][1]. If you just installed the Lambda integration, it may take a few minutes before you start seeing metrics appear.

Learn more about configuration steps and advanced setup for the [Datadog Forwarder][2] and the [Datadog Lambda Layer][3].

Use the following table to help troubleshoot issues you might be experiencing with various pieces of serverless monitoring:


| Feature						| Description |
| -----------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------|
| [Lambda Metrics][4]      		| AWS Lambda metrics pulled from Amazon CloudWatch.|
| [Enhanced Metrics][5]     	| Real-time enhanced Lambda metrics generated by Datadog.|
| [Lambda Logs][6]     			| Log management and ingestion of logs from your Lambda functions.|
| [Lambda Custom Metrics][7]	| Custom metrics ingestion from your Lambda functions.|
| [Datadog APM][8]       		| Distributed tracing using the Datadog Tracer or AWS X-Ray.|

If youâ€™re still unsure about the issue, you may reach out to the [Datadog support team][9].
