[Datadog App and API Protection (AAP)][2] provides observability into application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities, and into bad actors targeting your systems.

AAP secures functions written in Python, Node, Go, Java, and .NET. Because AAP is built on top of Serverless APM, you can set it up by adding an environment variable.

AAP supports over 130 event rules across major threats such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting, security scanner, local file inclusion, and more. 

You can [get started managing threats to your functions with AAP][3] today.
