{{< img src="serverless/lambda/tracing/serverless_trace2.png" alt="In Datadog's Trace Explorer, a trace from an AWS Lambda application" style="width:100%;">}}

Datadog [Application Performance Monitoring][1] (APM) supports distributed tracing for AWS Lambda applications. Connecting serverless traces to your [Lambda metrics][2] provides a context-rich picture of your AWS Lambda application's performance, allowing you to better troubleshoot performance issues.

## Send traces from your AWS Lambda application

{{< img src="serverless/serverless_custom_metrics.png" alt="Architecture diagram for collecting traces, enhanced metrics, custom metrics, and logs from an AWS Lambda application and sending the data to Datadog" >}}

A runtime-specific [Datadog Lambda library][3] collects traces, enhanced metrics, and custom metrics from your Lambda function runtime. The Lambda library submits this data to the [Datadog Lambda Extension][4], a build of the Datadog Agent that then pushes your data to Datadog.

For detailed installation instructions, select your Lambda runtime:

## Visualize your AWS Lambda traces

In Datadog, the [Serverless > AWS Lambda][5] view displays all of your functions, grouped by service. 

{{< img src="serverless/lambda/tracing/service-view.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:90%;" >}}

Click on a function to see its details. Under the **Invocations** tab, choose an invocation and click **Open trace** to view the individual trace.

{{< img src="serverless/lambda/tracing/open-trace.png" alt="Your image description" style="width:90%;" >}}

To understand your trace, you can use the following visualizations:
- **Flame Graph**: Displays color-coded spans on a timeline. Useful for understanding the execution path of a request and where time was spent over a trace.
- **Waterfall**: Displays color-coded spans on a timeline, where each row corresponds to a span. Useful for isolating and focusing on specific parts of a trace.
- **Span List**: Displays grouped resources and sorts them according to span count. Useful for scanning latency information by resource or grouping.
- **Map**: Displays all services involved in the trace and their dependencies. Useful for understanding the transaction lifecycle at the service level.

{{< img src="serverless/lambda/tracing/trace-view.png" alt="Waterfall visualization for a trace." style="width:90%;" >}}

See [APM Trace Explorer][6] for more information, including how to search traces and spans.

## Further configuration

### Tagging traces with AWS Payload Extraction

Datadog's [AWS Payload Extraction][7] captures request and response data exchanged between your application and AWS services, and attaches the extracted information as tags to your traces. 

For configuration instructions and further details, see [Capture Requests and Responses from AWS Services][7].

_Supported runtimes_: Python, Node.js, Java

_Supported AWS services_: SNS, SQS, Kinesis, S3, EventBridge

### Passing trace context

### Merging AWS X-Ray traces

If you are tracing some of your functions with AWS X-Ray, you can merge your X-Ray traces with Datadog to see connected traces across your infrastructure. 

For configuration instructions and further details, see [Merge AWS X-Ray traces with Datadog APM][8].

_Supported runtimes_: Python, Node.js
