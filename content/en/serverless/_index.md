## Overview

Serverless is a concept where you write event-driven code and upload it to a cloud provider, which manages all of the underlying computational resources. [Datadog Serverless][1] brings together metrics, traces, and logs from your AWS Lambda functions running serverless applications into one view.

<div class="alert alert-info">Make sure to check out discussions going on in the <a href="https://datadoghq.slack.com/archives/CFDPB83M4">#serverless</a> channel in the <a href="https://chat.datadoghq.com/">Datadog Slack community</a>.</div>

## Getting started

1. Install the [AWS integration][2]. This allows Datadog to ingest Lambda metrics from AWS CloudWatch. 
2. Install the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][3], which is required for ingestion of AWS Lambda traces, enhanced metrics, custom metrics, and logs.
   **Note**: Skip this step if you already have the forwarder function installed as part of the [AWS integration][2] CloudFormation stack.
3. Instrument your application. Select the Lambda runtime below for instructions to instrument your serverless application.

## Other services

### Azure App Service

The Datadog extension for Azure App Service provides tracing capabilities for Azure Web Apps. For more information setting up tracing in Azure, see the [Azure App Service Extension documentation][4].

### Google Cloud Functions

Google Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions. To monitor serverless functions running on Google Cloud Platform, enable the [Google Cloud Platform integration][5].
