This guide walks you through how to set up the [Datadog Lambda Extension][1] inside a VPC using [AWS PrivateLink][2].

## Overview

The Datadog Lambda Extension is a companion process that augments your Lambda functions to collect data such as logs, traces, and metrics and forwards them to Datadog. For functions running inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network access may be restricted by subnet routing rules or network ACLs, preventing access to Datadog's API. This article covers adding Datadog's AWS PrivateLink endpoints to your VPC, in addition to related setup of the Datadog Lambda Extension.

## Connect VPC to Datadog PrivateLink endpoints

Add Datadog's Private Link endpoints to your VPC, as described in the [PrivateLink guide][3]. The Extension requires the metric, log, API, and trace endpoints. For regions outside `us-east-1`, you may want to set up [inter-region peering][4].

## Extension configuration

By default, the Extension uses different API endpoints than the Datadog Agent. Override the endpoints by setting the following environment variables on the Lambda function.

```
DD_URL="https://agent.datadoghq.com"
DD_LOGS_CONFIG_USE_HTTP=true
DD_LOGS_CONFIG_LOGS_DD_URL="agent-http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com:443"
```

Alternatively, you can configure the Extension by adding a [`datadog.yaml`][5] file in the same folder as the Lambda handler code.

```
dd_url: https://agent.datadoghq.com
logs_config:
    use_http: true
    logs_dd_url: agent-http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com:443
```
