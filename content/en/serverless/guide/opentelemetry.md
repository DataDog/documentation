[OpenTelemetry][1] is an open source observability framework that provides IT teams with standardized protocols and tools for collecting and routing telemetry data.

If your code is custom instrumented with the [OpenTelemetry API][2], or you want to write vendor-agnostic custom instrumentation code, you can configure it to generate Datadog-style spans and traces. You can then process these spans and traces with the Datadog tracing library for your language, and send the data to Datadog.

### AWS Lambda

The Datadog tracing library, which is included in the Datadog Lambda Extension upon installation, accepts the spans and traces generated by OpenTelemetry-instrumented code, processes the telemetry, and sends it to Datadog.

You can use this approach if, for example, your code has already been instrumented with the OpenTelemetry API. You may also use this approach if you want to instrument using vendor-agnostic code with the OpenTelemetry API while still gaining the benefits of using the Datadog tracing libraries.

To instrument AWS Lambda with the OpenTelemetry API, set the environment variable `DD_TRACE_OTEL_ENABLED` to `true`. See [Custom instrumentation with the OpenTelemetry API][3] for more details.
