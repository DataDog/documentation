[OpenTelemetry][1] is an open source observability framework that provides IT teams with standardized protocols and tools for collecting and routing telemetry data.

If your code is custom instrumented with the [OpenTelemetry API][2], or you want to write vendor-agnostic custom instrumentation code, you can configure it to generate Datadog-style spans and traces. You can then process these spans and traces with the Datadog tracing library for your language, and send the data to Datadog.

### AWS Lambda
