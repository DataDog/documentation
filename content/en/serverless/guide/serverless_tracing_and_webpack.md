# Compatibility

Datadog's tracing libraries (`dd-trace`) are known to be not compatible with bundlers like [webpack][1] due to the use of conditional imports and other issues. While webpack cannot build `dd-trace`, your application can still use the `dd-trace` and `datadog-lambda-js` libraries provided by the prebuilt Datadog Lambda layer. Follow the instructions below.

## webpack
1. Follow the [installation instructions for Node.js][2] and ensure the Datadog Lambda layer for Node.js is added to your Lambda function.
2. Remove `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` from your `package.json` and the build process.
3. Mark `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` as [externals][3]. This tells the bundler to skip building them as dependencies, since they are already available in the Lambda runtime provided by the Datadog Lambda layer.

    **webpack.config.js**
    
    ```
    var nodeExternals = require("webpack-node-externals");

    module.exports = {
      // use webpack-node-externals to exclude all node dependencies.
      // You can manually set the externals too.
      externals: [nodeExternals(), "dd-trace", "datadog-lambda-js"],
    };
    ```

4. If you are using the `serverless-webpack` and have the option `includeModules` set to any value other than `false`, serverless-webpack automatically [packs external modules under node_modules][5]. Therefore, you must force exclude `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace`. Skip this step if you don't use `serverless-webpack` or you don't have the `includeModules` option in your serverless.yml.

    **serverless.yml**

    ```
    custom:
      webpack:
        # Note: You only need the following if you already have the includeModules option configured
        includeModules:
          # ... your existing configuration for includeModules
          forceExclude:
            - dd-trace
            - datadog-lambda-js
        packagerOptions:
          scripts:
            # optional, only needed when they are included as transitive dependencies 
            - rm -rf node_modules/datadog-lambda-js node_modules/dd-trace
    ```

## esbuild
1. Follow the [installation instructions for Node.js][2] and ensure the Datadog Lambda layer for Node.js is added to your Lambda function.
2. Remove `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` from your `package.json` and the build process.
3. Mark `datadog-lambda-js` and `dd-trace` as [externals][4]. This tells the bundler to skip building them as dependencies, since they are already available in the Lambda runtime provided by the Datadog Lambda layer.
    
    **esbuild.config.js (if using esbuild-config)**
    
    ```
    {
      "external": ["dd-trace", "datadog-lambda-js"],
    }
    ```

    **serverless.yml (if using serverless-esbuild)**

    ```
    custom:
      esbuild:
        exclude: ["dd-trace", "datadog-lambda-js", "aws-sdk"] # aws-sdk is needed because it is the default value for `exclude`
    ```
