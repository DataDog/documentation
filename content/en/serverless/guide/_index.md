kind: guide

Use these guides to set up metrics, traces, and logs in your serverless ecosystem. 

- First, we’ll set up **Datadog Lambda Enhanced Metrics** to illustrate how to graph cold starts across your Lambda infrastructure. 
- Second, we’ll enable Lambda **logs ingestion** and show you how to navigate Lambda error logs. Third, we’ll demonstrate some tools for fast root cause analysis by enabling Lambda **distributed tracing**. 
- Last, we’ll demonstrate how to monitor **custom metrics** and services across your serverless ecosystem.
