[Datadog Application Security Management (ASM)][2] provides observability into application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities, and into bad actors targeting your systems.

ASM secures functions written in Python, Node, Go, Java, and .NET. Because ASM is built on top of Serverless APM, you can set it up by adding an environment variable.

ASM supports over 130 event rules across major threats such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting, security scanner, local file inclusion, and more. 

You can [get started managing threats to your functions with ASM][3] today.
