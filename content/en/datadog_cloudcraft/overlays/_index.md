## Overview

Cloudcraft supports overlays that integrate data from multiple sources, enriching your diagrams with real-time insights. These views let you group and filter resources by key attributes, helping you focus on different parts of your architecture for troubleshooting, cost optimization, or security analysis. Each overlay is designed to address a specific operational goal, making it easy to adapt the diagram to your needs.

## Available overlays

Cloudcraft provides the following built-in overlays: 

- [Infrastructure][1]: View resources grouped by Account, Region, and VPC for architecture diagrams and troubleshooting.
- [Observability][2]: See where the Datadog Agent is installed and which features are enabled per host.
- [Security][3]: Identify security exposures, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities in your architecture.
- [Cloud Cost Management (CCM)][4]: Discover savings opportunities with cost recommendations shown directly on resources.
