## Overview

The Infrastructure view provides a broad overview, grouping resources by Account, Region, and VPC. This view is ideal for generating architecture diagrams for troubleshooting or high-level review.

The infrastructure diagram excludes components like EBS, NAT Gateway, and Transit Gateway to reduce visual clutter and highlight the most important parts of your architecture.
