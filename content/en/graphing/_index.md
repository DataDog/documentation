Graphs are the window to your monitored systems. You see graphs throughout Datadog, in email notifications, Slack, and other integrations. You can define graphs for monitoring your infrastructure using metrics, monitors, dashboards, and notebooks.

## Overview

{{< whatsnext desc="This section includes the following topics:" >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/using_graphs/" >}}<u>Using graphs</u>: Whether using metrics, monitors, dashboards, or notebooks, all graphs have basic functionality in common - start here for best practices in setting up graphs.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/dashboards" >}}<u>Dashboards</u>: A dashboard is Datadog's tool that visually tracks, analyzes, and displays key performance metrics to monitor the health of your infrastructure. Learn more about using dashboards (screenboards and timeboards), template variables, and sharing your graphs with internal or external team members.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/metrics/" >}}<u>Metrics</u>: When you connect an integration to Datadog, the integration sends metrics about your system back to Datadog. Once Datadog receives these metrics, you can build graphs to explore the data.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/notebooks" >}}<u>Notebooks</u>: Notebooks combine graphs and text in a linear, cell-based format. They are designed to help you explore and share stories with your data.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/event_stream/" >}}<u>Event Stream</u>: The event stream is a display of the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/infrastructure/" >}}<u>Infrastructure</u>: The Infrastructure list page shows all hosts monitored by Datadog, including Host and Container Maps, Process Monitoring, and Serverless.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/functions/" >}}<u>From the query to the graph</u>: This sections goes through several topics to give you advanced graphing functions: Algorithms, Arithmetic, Count, Interpolation, Rank, Rate, Regression, Rollup, Smoothing, and Timeshift.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/graphing_json/" >}}<u>Graphing with JSON</u>: Use the Datadog API to create your graphs.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/widgets/" >}}<u>Widgets</u>: Find all of the types of visualizations you can create with Datadog.{{< /nextlink >}}
    {{< nextlink href="/graphing/guide/" >}}<u>Guides</u>: These are in-depth, step-by-step tutorials for using graphs.{{< /nextlink >}}
