The [event stream][1] is a display of the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

## Event Query Language

Narrow your search by filtering on certain event properties. See the list of filters below for more details.
**Note**: Filters perform an exact match search. Partial strings are not considered.

| Filter                                            | Description                                                                              |
| --------                                          | -------------                                                                            |
| `sources:github,chef`                             | Show events from GitHub OR Chef.                                                         |
| `tags:env-prod OR db`                             | Show events tagged with #env-prod OR #db.                                                |
| `tags:security-group:sg-123 AND role:common-node` | Show events tagged with `#security-group:sg-123` AND `#role:common-node`.                |
| `hosts:i-0ade23e6,db.myapp.com`                   | Show events from i-0ade23e6 OR db.myapp.com.                                             |
| `status:error`                                    | Show events with error status. (supports: **error**, **warning**, **success**)           |
| `priority:low`                                    | Show only low-priority events. (supports: **low** or **normal**. defaults to **all**)    |
| `cloud_provider:* NOT "azure"`                    | Show all cloud providers except the ones tagged with "azure"                             |

Full text search works on all keywords provided in the search query after applying any filters. Full text search looks inside the event text, title, tags, users who commented on the event, host names, and devices tied to the event.

Use tag search to find all events with the same key tag with the following query:

| Filter               | Description                                                                    |
| ----                 | ---                                                                            |
| `tags:<KEY>:<VALUE>` | Shows events with the `<KEY>:<VALUE>` tag.                                     |
| `<KEY>:*`            | Shows all events with the `<KEY>` attached.                                    |
| `<KEY>`:`<REGEX>`    | Shows all events with `<KEY>:<VALUE>` tag where `<VALUE>` matches the `<REGEX>`|
| `tags:<KEY>`         | Doesn't return anything.                                                       |
| `<KEY>:<VALUE>`      | Doesn't return anything.                                                       |

To combine multiple terms into a complex query, use any of the following Boolean operators:

| Operator | Description                                                                                                                      | Example                             |
| ----     | ----                                                                                                                             | -----                               |
| `AND`    | **Intersection**: both terms are in the selected events (for tags, if nothing is added, `AND` is taken by default).                        | `redis_* AND down`                  |
| `OR`     | **Union**: either term is contained in the selected events. Use a comma (`,`) for tags.                                                    | `sources:nagios,chef directory OR Mixlib`    |
| `NOT`    | **Exclusion**: the following term is NOT in the event. This operator works for strings only—use `-` in front of tags. | `-tags:<KEY>:<VALUE> NOT "<STRING>"` |


**Note**: Some of the advanced query language features (e.g. boolean logic) work only in the event stream page, and are not available in graph tiles or dashboard widgets.

Combine prefixes to construct more complex searches. For example, if you wanted to find all open `chef` or `nagios` errors that mention `cassandra`, you'd have a search like:

`sources:nagios,chef status:error cassandra`

**Note**: Do not use spaces after the colon or commas in these lists. Anything not attached to a prefix goes to full text search.

## Show events unaggregated

 To show unaggregated events in your event stream, un-check the **Aggregate related events** toggle in the upper right corner of your event stream:

## @ notifications

* `@support-datadog` - Creates a Datadog support ticket when posted directly to your event stream (including comments).
* `@all` – Sends a notification to all members of your organization.
* `@yourname` – Notifies the specific user named 'yourname'.
* `@test@example.com` Sends an email to `test@example.com`.
* If you have Slack, Webhooks, Pagerduty, or VictorOps, use:
    * `@slack-<SLACK_ACCOUNT>-<CHANNEL_NAME>` – posts the event or graph to that channel.
    * `@webhook` – Alerts or triggers whatever is attached to that webhook. Check out [our blogpost on Webhooks][2]!
    * `@pagerduty` – Sends an alert to Pagerduty. You can also use `@pagerduty-acknowledge` and `@pagerduty-resolve`.
