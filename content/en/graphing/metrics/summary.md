The [Metrics Summary page][1] displays a list of all the [metrics][2] reported to Datadog under a specified time frame: the past hour, day, or week. This list can be filtered by name. Clicking on a metric brings up a panel with more detailed information.

## Metric panel

The metric panel displays an overview for a given metric:

Key information about your metric can be seen:

* **Metric name**: The name of your metric to be used in the [metric explorer][3] or in [dashboard widgets][4].
* **Number of distinct metrics**: A metric name can correspond to multiple distinct metrics depending of its associated tags, Consult the [custom metrics documentation][5] to learn more.
* **Number of host**: The total number of hosts reporting this metric.
* **Number of tags**: The total number of tags attached to this metric. Read more about [tagging][6] and [how to assign tags][7].
* **Metrics metadata**: All metadata attached to your metric:
    * the metric description 
    * the [metric unit][8]
    * the [metric type][9] 
    * the integration name, if this metric is coming from an [integration][10]
    * the interval of collection of this metric.

### Metric metadata 

Every piece of metric metadata can be manually edited: 

* Edit the metric description to help understand what a metric does.

    If a metric is coming from an integration and you notice a wrong description, [open an issue in the Datadog documentation GitHub repository][11] for a fix.

* Edit the metric unit or add a custom unit for a custom metrics.

    When submitting custom metrics to Datadog, it is possible to change the [unit of measurement][1] which shows up when hovering over a certain metric in your graph. Do this by selecting your custom metric from the list and then selecting the unit of measurement you would like to use as depicted below:

    {{< img src="graphing/metrics/summary/metrics_metadata.gif" alt="Metrics Metadata" responsive="true" style="width:80%;">}}

    Note: This does not change the way that a metric graph is displayed (only the units of measurement when hovering over a metric)

* Edit the metric type to match the real metric type send. 
    Warning: this changes your metric behavior in **ALL** your analytics and monitors; do this at your own risk.
