Datadog classifies an _event_ as a record of any notable change relevant to managing IT operations such as code deployments, service health, configuration changes, or monitoring alerts. Datadog Events gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze, and filter events from any source in one place. Use these guides to programatically send events:
