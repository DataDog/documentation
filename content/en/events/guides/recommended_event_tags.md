It is recommended that all events should have the below tags to help you:
- Identify potential issues faster
- Locate other related events
- Filter to more accurately e.g to a particular environment

If using the [API][1], they can be added within the tags param or to learn more about to how add them to certain integrations, check out [assigning_tags][2]

###Type: Alert

The current supported alerts integrations, are:

[Amazon CloudWatch Alarms][3]

For all alerts it recommended at minimum to use the above standard attributes and for the above integrations they will automatically have an aggregation_key added to them.
