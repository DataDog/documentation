The Events Explorer displays the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

## Navigate the Explorer

{{< img src="events/explorer/navigate.png" alt="How to navigate the events explorer" >}}

The Events Explorer displays all event types by default. You can filter your events by facets or search queries.

### Event side panel

{{< img src="events/explorer/side-panel.gif" alt="Shows how clicking a row in the Events explorer opens the event side panel" >}}

Clicking a row in the Events Explorer opens a corresponding event side panel. This panel shows more detailed information related to the selected event. 

### Attributes tab

{{< img src="events/explorer/event-attribute.png" alt="An example Event Attributes tab" >}}

Datadog displays event attributes as JSON. You can click on an attribute to add or exclude it from the existing query, or add a column for this attribute. You can normalize or enrich event attributes with processing pipelines.

### Options

You can use the *Options* panel to customize your Events Explorer:

- Adjust the columns displayed.
- Select list density depending on your needs.
- Show absolute or relative timestamp. An absolute timestamp displays the time of the event in UTC (for example, `Aug 11 15:58.08.000`). A relative timestamp displays the time elapsed since the event and now (for example, `20 seconds ago`).
- Show or hide tags in your results.
- Show or hide the top timeline graph.

## Time range

A time range appears directly under the search bar as a timeline. This feature allows you to display events in the Explorer or Analytics within a given time period.

You can change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown, or by entering a custom time range.

Because all search parameters are contained within the URL, you can share your view by sharing the URL.

## Search syntax

Events search uses the [logs search syntax][1]: for example, `source:(github OR chef)`. Like logs search, events search includes:

- Use of both `AND` and `OR` operators
- Use of wildcards
- Escape characters
- Search within attributes with the `@` prefix

### Full-text

Full-text search works on all keywords provided in the search query after applying filters. Full-text search looks inside the event text, title, tags, users who commented on the event, hostnames, and devices tied to the event.

### Filters

Target specific event properties using these prefixes:

`source:(github OR chef)`           
: Show events from GitHub OR Chef.

`host:(i-0ade23e6 AND db.myapp.com)` 
: Show events from i-0ade23e6 AND db.myapp.com.

`service:kafka`                
: Show events from the `kafka` service.

`status:error`                 
: Show events with an error status (supports: `error`, `warning`, `success`).

`availability-zone:us-east-1a` 
: Show events in the `us-east-1a` AWS availability zone (AZ).

`container_id:foo*`             
: Show events from all containers with the ID beginning with `foo`.

`@evt.name:foo`                
: Show the event named `foo`.

### Set up facets

After your events attributes are collected, Datadog indexes these attributes as facets or measures to be accessible for your content creation and analytics.

A facet displays the distinct members of an attribute or a tag and provides basic analytics, such as the number of events represented. Facets allow you to pivot or filter your datasets based on a given attribute. To filter, select the values that you want to see.

{{< img src="events/explorer/facets-location.png" alt="Shows that the facets are on the left side of the screen next to the menu." >}}

### Create a facet

To create a facet, use the “Add a facet” button in the left side panel.

Once you add the facet, the value of this attribute is stored for all new views, and you can use it in the search bar and facet panels. You can also use it to group by in event monitors and graph widgets.

## Notifications

Datadog supports `@notifications` in the messages of events when posted by the API. For example:

`@all`                                  
: Sends a notification to all members of your organization.

`@test@example.com`                     
: Sends an email to `test@example.com`.

`@slack-<SLACK_ACCOUNT>-<CHANNEL_NAME>` 
: Posts the event or graph to the specified Slack channel.

`@webhook`                              
: Alerts or triggers the webhook. See the [blog post on webhooks][2].

## Event Analytics

Event Analytics extends the Events Explorer page with views, data aggregation, and split capabilities for troubleshooting and monitoring. You can control:

- The query that filters the set of views to analyze.
- The dimensions over which to split data.
- The visualization method for aggregates and splits.

From an analytics visualization, you can, additionally:
- Create a widget in a dashboard out of that visualization.
- Export the visualization into a notebook.

### Build an analytics query

Use the query to control what’s displayed in your Events Analytics.

1. Choose an attribute or tag to graph, and then add it as a facet. Graphing a facet displays the unique count of the variable.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/split-graph.png" alt="Shows the list of facets that can be graphed." >}}
2. Use a facet to split your graph.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/facet-to-graph.png" alt="Shows the list of facets that can be graphed." >}}
3. Choose the time interval for your graph. Changing the global timeframe changes the list of available timestep values. You can display the results as a timeseries, table, or toplist.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/time-interval.png" alt="Shows the list of possible time intervals, including the default, 5 seconds." >}}
4. Choose to display either the X top or bottom values according to the selected measure.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/display-values.png" alt="Choose to display the values from the top or from the bottom." >}}
