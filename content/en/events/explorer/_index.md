The events explorer displays the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors. You can customize the columns displayed by using the **Options** button to the top right of the events. 

## Navigate the Explorer

{{< img src="events/explorer/navigate.png" alt="How to navigate the events explorer" >}}

The Events explorer displays all event types by default. You can filter your events by facets or search queries.

### Event Side Panel

{{< img src="events/explorer/event-side-panel.png" alt="Shows how clicking a row in the Events explorer opens the event side panel" >}}

Clicking a row in the Events explorer opens the event side panel. It shows all the information relative to an event. 

### Attributes Tab

{{< img src="events/explorer/event-attribute.png" alt="An example events attribute tab" >}}

We collect context information by default in JSON format. You can enrich event attributes with processing pipelines.

## Context

Build up the context to explore your events in your Events Explorer page by selecting the proper time range and then by using the search bar to filter your events and analytics.

### Time Range

The time range appears directly under the search bar as a timeline. This feature allows you to display events in the explorer or analytics within a given period.

Quickly change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown (or entering a custom time frame)

All of the search parameters are contained within the URL. So, you can share your view by sharing the URL.

## Event Search

### Full-text

Full-text search works on all keywords provided in the search query after applying filters. Full-text search looks inside the event text, title, tags, users who commented on the event, hostnames, and devices tied to the event.

### Filters

Target specific event properties using these prefixes:

`source:github,chef`           
: Show events from GitHub OR Chef.

`host:i-0ade23e6,db.myapp.com` 
: Show events from i-0ade23e6 OR db.myapp.com.

`service:kafka`                
: Show events from the `kafka` service.

`status:error`                 
: Show events with an error status (supports: `error`, `warning`, `success`).

`role:`                        
: 

`availability-zone:us-east-1a` 
: Show events in the `us-east-1a` AWS availability zone (AZ).

`container_id:foo`             
: Show events from the container with the ID `foo`.

`@evt.name:foo`                
: Show the event named `foo`.

### Set Up Facets

After being collected, your Events attributes can be indexed as facets or measures to be accessible for your context creation and analytics.

A facet displays the distinct members of an attribute or a tag and provides basic analytics, such as the number of events represented. Facets allow you to pivot or filter your datasets based on a given attribute. To filter, select the values that you want to see.

{{< img src="events/explorer/facets-location.png" alt="Shows that the facets are on the left side of the screen next to the menu." >}}

### Create a Facet

To start using an attribute as a facet or in the search, click on it and add it as a facet:

{{< img src="events/explorer/create-facet.png" alt="Shows the facet code when you click into the facet" >}}

Once you add the facet, the value of this attribute is stored for all new views, and you can use it in the search bar and facets panel.

## Event Analytics

Events Analytics extends the Events Explorer page with views data aggregation and split capabilities for troubleshooting and monitoring. You can control:

- The query that filters the set of views to analyze.
- The dimensions over which to split data.
- The visualization method for aggregates and splits.

From an analytics visualization, you can, additionally:
- Create a widget in a dashboard out of that visualization.
- Export the visualization into a notebook

### Build an Analytics Query

Use the query to control whatâ€™s displayed in your Events Analytics.

1. Choose a facet to graph, which will display the unique count of the variable you choose.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/split-graph.png" alt="Shows the list of facets that can be graphed." >}}
2. Use a facet to split your graph
    {{< img src="events/explorer/facet-to-graph.png" alt="Shows the list of facets that can be graphed." >}}
3. Choose the time interval for your graph. Changing the global timeframe changes the list of available timestep values.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/time-interval.png" alt="Shows the list of possible time intervals, including the default, 5 seconds." >}}
4. Choose to display either the X top or bottom values according to the selected measure.
    {{< img src="events/explorer/display-values.png" alt="Choose whether to display the values from the top or from the bottom." >}}
