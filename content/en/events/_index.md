## What are Datadog events?

Datadog classifies an _event_ as any notable changes relevant for managing IT operations such as code deployments, service health, configuration changes, or monitoring alerts. [Datadog Events][1] gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze, and filter events from any source in one place. 

## Getting started

The Datadog Events Stream gives you an instant view of what happened in your infrastructure and services to help you troubleshoot any issue happening right now - or in the past.

It works out of the box, by gathering events automatically collected via the Agent or installed integrations, without any additional setup.

100+ of our existing integrations are supporting events collection, including [Kubernetes][3], [Docker][4], [Jenkins][5], [Chef][6], [Puppet][7], [AWS ECS][8] or [Autoscaling][9], [Sentry][10], and [Nagios][11]. 

You can also submit your own custom events using the Datadog API, Emails and more.

## Exploring Datadog Events

### Events stream

The event stream is a display of the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

### Events explorer and analytics
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The Events Explorer is in private beta. This includes the explorer, analytics, events as a source in dashboards, generating custom metrics from events, and the monitor alerts overview dashboard. To request access, contact <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">Datadog Support</a>. If you are looking for legacy events information, see the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/events/stream/">Events Stream documentation</a>.</div>

Use the [events explorer][12] to aggregate and view all events coming into Datadog. Break down events by attribute and graphically represent them with [event analytics][13]. Utilize our [new query syntax][20] to filter alerts using AND, OR, and Wildcard operators.

### Events as a source in dashboards and monitors

Use Events as a source in [graph widgets][14] and [event monitors][15] to create timeseries, tables, and top lists of your event search queries. You can explore the capabilities of this feature with our new OOTB Dashboard "Monitor Notifications Overview"

### Generate custom metrics from events

[Generate metrics][13] with 15-month retention from any event search query to create and monitor historical events and alerts.

### Send your custom events to Datadog

You can send your events to Datadog with a [Custom Agent Check][16], [DogStatsD][17], the [Datadog API][18], or with [email][19].
