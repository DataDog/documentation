## Getting started

_Events_ are records of notable changes relevant for managing and troubleshooting IT operations, such as code deployments, service health, configuration changes, or monitoring alerts.

[Datadog Events][1] gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze, and filter events from any source in one place.

It works out of the box, by gathering events automatically collected via the Agent or installed integrations, without any additional setup.

100+ of our existing integrations are supporting events collection, including [Kubernetes][2], [Docker][3], [Jenkins][4], [Chef][5], [Puppet][6], [AWS ECS][7] or [Autoscaling][8], [Sentry][9], and [Nagios][10]. 

## Send your custom events to Datadog

You can also submit your own custom events using the [Datadog API][11], [Custom Agent Check][12], [DogStatsD][13],  or via the [Events Email API][14].

## Exploring Datadog Events

### Events stream

The Datadog Events Stream shows an instant view of what happened in your infrastructure and services to help you troubleshoot any issue happening right now - or in the past.

The event stream is a display of the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

### Events explorer and analytics
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The Events Explorer and the following features listed below are in private beta. To request access, contact <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">Datadog Support</a>.</div>

Use the [events explorer][15] to aggregate and view all events coming into Datadog. Break down events by attribute and graphically represent them with [event analytics][16]. Utilize our [new query syntax][17] to filter events using AND, OR, and Wildcard operators.

### Events as a source in dashboards widgets

Events are now available as a data source in [graph widgets][18]. You can build timeseries, tables, and top lists widgets of your event search queries.

The new [Monitor Notifications Overview][19] dashboard showcases these new features by analyzing monitor alert trends to help you improve your configuration and reduce alert fatigue.


### Generate custom metrics from events 

[Generate metrics][16] with 15-month retention from any event search query to create and monitor historical events and alerts.

### Normalize and enrich events with processing pipelines

A processor run data-structuring actions on events attributes at ingestion.
Pipelines are composed of one or multiple processors executed sequentially.
With event processing pipelines, you can:
- normalize disparate sources of events by remapping attributes. For example, use the same reserved [service tags][20] everywhere)
- enrich events with external data saved in an [Enrichment Table][21] (beta). For example, map a service name with your service directory to enrich events with team ownership, link to dashboard or documentation.

We are working to support more processors types. For more details, contact support.
