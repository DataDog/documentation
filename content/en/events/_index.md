## Getting started

_Events_ are records of notable changes relevant for managing and troubleshooting IT operations, such as code deployments, service health, configuration changes, or monitoring alerts.

[Datadog Events][1] gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze, and filter events from any source in one place.

It works out of the box, by gathering events automatically collected via the Agent or installed integrations, without any additional setup.

100+ of our existing integrations are supporting events collection, including [Kubernetes][2], [Docker][3], [Jenkins][4], [Chef][5], [Puppet][6], [AWS ECS][7] or [Autoscaling][8], [Sentry][9], and [Nagios][10]. 

## Send your custom events to Datadog

You can also submit your own custom events using the [Datadog API][11], [Custom Agent Check][12], [DogStatsD][13],  or via the [Events Email API][14].

## Exploring Datadog Events

### Events stream

The Datadog Events Stream shows an instant view of what happened in your infrastructure and services to help you troubleshoot any issue happening right now - or in the past.

The event stream is a display of the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

{{< img src="events/the-event-stream.jpg" alt="Image of an out of the box events stream." >}}

### Events explorer and analytics
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The Events Explorer and the following features listed below are in private beta. To request access, contact <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">Datadog Support</a>.</div>

Use the [events explorer][15] to aggregate and view all events coming into Datadog. Break down events by attribute and graphically represent them with [event analytics][16]. Utilize our [new query syntax][17] to filter events using AND, OR, and Wildcard operators. 

{{< img src="events/events-explorer.gif" alt="Image of an out of the box events explorer where you can sort by attributes and analytics." >}}

### Events as a source in dashboards widgets

Events are now available as a data source in [graph widgets][18]. You can build timeseries, tables, and top lists widgets of your event search queries.

{{< img src="events/events-dashboard.gif" alt="Image of an graph widget where events is used as the source." >}}

The new [Monitor Notifications Overview][19] dashboard showcases these new features by analyzing monitor alert trends to help you improve your configuration and reduce alert fatigue.


### Generate custom metrics from events 

[Generate metrics][16] with 15-month retention from any event search query to create and monitor historical events and alerts.

{{< img src="events/generate-metrics.png" alt="Image of metrics with the events search query." >}}

### Normalize and enrich events with processing pipelines

A processor run data-structuring actions on events attributes at ingestion.
Pipelines are composed of one or multiple processors executed sequentially.
With event processing pipelines, you can:
- normalize disparate sources of events by remapping attributes. For example, use the same reserved [service tags][20] everywhere)
- enrich events with external data saved in an [Enrichment Table][21] (beta). For example, map a service name with your service directory to enrich events with team ownership, link to dashboard or documentation.

We are working to support more processors types. For more details, contact support.

#### Context

Build up a context to explore your events on the Events Explorer page by selecting the proper time range, then use the search bar to filter your events and analytics.

#### Facets and measures

After collection, your event attributes can be indexed as facets or measures. On the left side, use facets and measures to filter your results. You can create new facets or measures from existing event tags or attributes.

A **facet** displays all the distinct members of an attribute or a tag and provides some basic analytics, such as the number of events represented. Facets allow you to pivot or filter your datasets based on a given attribute. To filter, select the values that you want to see. To start using an attribute as a facet, click on it and use the option to **Create facet**. The value of this attribute is stored for all new events.

A **measure** is an attribute with a numerical value contained in your event. To start using an attribute as a measure, click on a numerical attribute and use the option to **Create measure**. The value of this attribute is stored for all new events.

#### Saved views

Use saved views to automatically configure your events explorer with a preselected set of facets, measures, searches, time ranges, and visualizations. See [Saved Views][5] to learn more.

#### Advanced

For a more advanced search, use the Datadog event query language, for example:

`tags:env-prod OR db`                             
: Show events tagged with #env-prod OR #db.

`tags:security-group:sg-123 AND role:common-node` 
: Show events tagged with `#security-group:sg-123` AND `#role:common-node`.

`cloud_provider:* NOT "azure"`                    
: Show all cloud providers except the ones tagged with "azure".

Use tag search to find all events with the same key tag, for example:

`tags:<KEY>:<VALUE>` 
: Shows events with the `<KEY>:<VALUE>` tag.

`<KEY>:*`            
: Shows all events with the `<KEY>` attached.

`<KEY>`:`<REGEX>`    
: Shows all events with `<KEY>:<VALUE>` tag where the `<VALUE>` matches the `<REGEX>`.

`tags:<KEY>`         
: This is not a valid search.

`<KEY>:<VALUE>`      
: This is not a valid search.

To combine multiple terms into a complex query, use the following Boolean operators:

`AND`    
: **Intersection**: both terms are in the selected events (for tags, if nothing is added, `AND` is the default).        
: **Example**: `redis_* AND down`

`OR`     
: **Union**: either term is contained in the selected events. Use a comma (`,`) for tags.                               
: **Example**: `sources:nagios,chef directory OR Mixlib`

`NOT`    
: **Exclusion**: the following term is NOT in the event. This operator works for strings only—use `-` in front of tags. 
: **Example**: `-tags:<KEY>:<VALUE> NOT "<STRING>"`

**Note**: Some of the advanced query language features like Boolean logic work only in the event stream page, and are not available in graph tiles or dashboard widgets.

Combine prefixes to construct more complex searches. For example, to find all open `chef` or `nagios` errors that mention `cassandra`, use:

```text
sources:nagios,chef status:error cassandra
```

**Note**: Do not use spaces after the colon or commas in these lists. Anything not attached to a prefix goes to full text search.

For a more advanced search, use the Datadog event query language, for example:

`tags:env-prod OR db`                             
: Show events tagged with #env-prod OR #db.

`tags:security-group:sg-123 AND role:common-node` 
: Show events tagged with `#security-group:sg-123` AND `#role:common-node`.

`cloud_provider:* NOT "azure"`                    
: Show all cloud providers except the ones tagged with "azure".

Use tag search to find all events with the same key tag, for example:

`tags:<KEY>:<VALUE>` 
: Shows events with the `<KEY>:<VALUE>` tag.

`<KEY>:*`            
: Shows all events with the `<KEY>` attached.

`<KEY>`:`<REGEX>`    
: Shows all events with `<KEY>:<VALUE>` tag where the `<VALUE>` matches the `<REGEX>`.

`tags:<KEY>`         
: This is not a valid search.

`<KEY>:<VALUE>`      
: This is not a valid search.

### Aggregation

By default, related events are aggregated when displayed in the events stream. To show unaggregated events, un-check the **Aggregate related events** box at the top right of your event stream:

### Notifications

Datadog supports `@notifications`, for example:

`@support-datadog`                      
: Creates a Datadog support ticket when posted directly to your events (including comments).

`@all`                                  
: Sends a notification to all members of your organization.

`@john`                                 
: Notifies the user named `john`.

`@test@example.com`                     
: Sends an email to `test@example.com`.

`@slack-<SLACK_ACCOUNT>-<CHANNEL_NAME>` 
: Posts the event or graph to the specified Slack channel.

`@webhook`                              
: Alerts or triggers the webhook. See the [blog post on webhooks][7].

`@pagerduty`                            
: Sends an alert to Pagerduty. You can also use `@pagerduty-acknowledge` and `@pagerduty-resolve`.
