## Getting started

Datadog classifies an _event_ as any notable changes relevant for managing IT operations such as code deployments, service health, configuration changes, or monitoring alerts.

[Datadog Events][1] gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze, and filter events from any source in one place

It works out of the box, by gathering events automatically collected via the Agent or installed integrations, without any additional setup.

100+ of our existing integrations are supporting events collection, including [Kubernetes][2], [Docker][3], [Jenkins][4], [Chef][5], [Puppet][6], [AWS ECS][7] or [Autoscaling][8], [Sentry][9], and [Nagios][10]. 

## Send your custom events to Datadog

You can also submit your own custom events using the [Datadog API][11], [Custom Agent Check][12], [DogStatsD][13],  or via the [Events Email API][14].

## Exploring Datadog Events

### Events stream

The Datadog Events Stream shows an instant view of what happened in your infrastructure and services to help you troubleshoot any issue happening right now - or in the past.

The event stream is a display of the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

### Events explorer and analytics
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The Events Explorer and the following features listed below are in private beta. To request access, contact <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">Datadog Support</a>.</div>

Use the [events explorer][15] to aggregate and view all events coming into Datadog. Break down events by attribute and graphically represent them with [event analytics][16]. Utilize our [new query syntax][17] to filter alerts using AND, OR, and Wildcard operators.

### Events as a source in dashboards and monitors

Use Events as a source in [graph widgets][18] and [event monitors][19] to create timeseries, tables, and top lists of your event search queries. You can explore the capabilities of this feature with our new OOTB Dashboard "Monitor Notifications Overview"

### Generate custom metrics from events

[Generate metrics][16] with 15-month retention from any event search query to create and monitor historical events and alerts.
