## Getting started

_Events_ are records of notable changes relevant for managing and troubleshooting IT operations, such as code deployments, service health, configuration changes, or monitoring alerts.

Datadog Events gives you a consolidated interface to search, analyze, and filter events from any source in one place.

Without any additional setup, Datadog Events automatically gathers events that are collected by the Agent and installed integrations.

More than 100 Datadog integrations support events collection, including [Kubernetes][2], [Docker][3], [Jenkins][4], [Chef][5], [Puppet][6], [AWS ECS][7] or [Autoscaling][8], [Sentry][9], and [Nagios][10]. 

## Sending custom events to Datadog

You can also submit your own custom events using the [Datadog API][11], [Custom Agent Check][12], [DogStatsD][13], or the [Events Email API][14].

## Exploring Datadog Events

### Events stream

The Datadog Events Stream shows an instant view of your infrastructure and services events, to help you troubleshoot issues happening now or in the past.

The event stream displays the most recent events generated by your infrastructure and the associated monitors.

### Events explorer and analytics

<div class="alert alert-warning">The Events Explorer and the features listed below are in private beta. To request access, contact <a href="/help/">Datadog Support</a>.</div>

Use the [Events Explorer][15] to aggregate and view events coming into Datadog. Group or filter events by attribute and graphically represent them with [event analytics][16]. Use the [query syntax][17] to filter events using Boolean and wildcard operators.

### Events as a source in dashboards widgets

You can use events as a data source in [graph widgets][18]. You can build timeseries, tables, and top list widgets of your event search queries.

For example, check out the [Monitor Notifications Overview][19] dashboard, which analyzes monitor alert event trends to help you improve your configuration and reduce alert fatigue.

### Generate custom metrics from events 

[Generate metrics][16] with 15-month retention from any event search query to create and monitor historical events and alerts.

### Normalize and enrich events with processing pipelines

A _processor_ runs data-structuring actions on events attributes when they are ingested. A _pipelines_ is composed of one or multiple processors executed sequentially. With event processing pipelines, you can:

- Normalize disparate sources of events by remapping attributes. For example, use the same reserved [service tags][20] everywhere.
- Enrich events with external data saved in an [enrichment table][21] (beta). For example, map a service name with your service directory to enrich events with team ownership information, links to dashboards, or links to documentation.

We are working to support more processors types. For more details, [contact Support][22].
