## Overview

Use the various charts to visualize your users' journeys from end-to-end to discover the different ways users navigate your application. You can extract the data to identify frictions in the user journey, measure the success of UI changes and inform your application design decisions. 

## Deciding which chart to use


### Pathways diagram

The [Pathways diagram][3] allows you to visualize all user journeys across your application to identify the most important contributions to a flow.


### Funnel analysis

With [funnel analysis][2], you can understand the end-to-end conversion of a single essential workflow. You can view details in the side panel to understand why conversation rates are what they are.
For example, you can determine if there was there a performance issue that caused user drop-off. Are customers experiencing an error that occurred in a recent release? Watch a Session Replay of a user who converted or dropped off to see exactly what happened.

### Retention Analysis

With [retention analysis][4] you can measure how often users are successfully returning to a page or to an action. This measure offers insight into overall user satisfaction with your application. 

### Analytic Explorer

The [Analytics Explorer][1] contains views data aggregation to help you understand how your product is being used. You can create a widget in a dashboard out of that visualization and dive deeper into subsets of the events list depending on the interactions that the visualization enables.
