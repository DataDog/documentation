## Overview

Pathways diagrams allow you to visualize all user journeys across your application to analyze the critical path.

{{< img src="/product_analytics/journeys/pathways/ga_pathway_diagrams_page.png" alt="The default Pathways diagram for an app" style="width:90%;" >}}

Each node represents a view the user visited. The thickness of each node represents the count of user sessions on that page. A page with fewer visitors has a thinner node in the diagram.

If a user visits the same page multiple times during their session, that page is only counted once.

Action events are not supported in the Pathways diagram.

## Build a Pathways diagram

### View the default diagram

1. Navigate to [**Product Analytics > Charts**][1].
2. Click **Pathways** if it's not already selected. This displays the default visualization that represents the most popular user journeys in your application.

### Start or end the diagram at a given view

You can use the left menu to customize this diagram and display:
- the steps users took *after* visiting a given view
- the steps users took *before* visiting a given view

The example below displays the four steps that users in the United States take after visiting `/department/lighting`:

### Graph all views containing a given phrase

Pathways diagrams support [Datadog wildcards][2], allowing you to build a diagram of all views containing a given phrase.

To match multiple routes, type a wildcard instead of choosing a single view name. The example below displays the five steps that users take after visiting any view matching `/department/*`:

## Analyze a Pathways diagram

You can hover over a diagram node to view the number of sessions that included visits to that view.

Click a node for a list of analysis options, such as viewing a sample [Session Replay][3] or building a Pathways diagram that starts with that view.

### Convert the diagram to a funnel

1. From the Pathways diagram page, click the **Build Funnel** button.
2. In the Pathways diagram, click the nodes of the views you want to include in the funnel.
3. Click **Create Funnel From Selection**.
