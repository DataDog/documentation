## Overview

The [User Profiles][7] and [Account Profiles][8] pages contain enriched data on the users and accounts interacting with your product. 

These profile pages integrate attributes extracted from collected events with information from third-party sources. Examples of these attributes include a user’s `first_seen` timestamp and an account’s `account_id`. Together, they help create comprehensive, centralized profiles.

These enriched profiles enable more precise segmentation and deeper analysis of user behavior, helping you identify patterns over time, track key cohorts (for example, users active after six months), and guide product decisions and engagement strategies. 

## Profiles

User and account profiles are generated from RUM events collected through the RUM SDK. Use `datadogRum.setUser` to [set user attributes][2] and `datadogRum.setAccount` to set [account attributes][3].

User profiles are grouped by the `user_id` attribute, while account profiles are grouped by `account_id`.

You can also customize these pages by adding attributes that matter most to your team. See the [Custom Attributes section](#use-custom-attributes-to-enrich-your-profiles) to learn how to tailor profile data to your needs. 


### User profiles 

The [User Profiles][7] page lists the users who are interacting with your application. You can select a user to view detailed insights into their activity, including their most visited pages, frequent actions, and session history.

Use the session history to identify moments of [frustration][9] and follow the **View Analytics** links to explore the related analytics.

{{< img src="product_analytics/segmentation/pana_frustration_detected.png" alt="Explore the user profiles page and its session history." style="width:80%;">}}

Each profile has attributes to help you better segment your users. You can conduct a full-text search or sort and filter based on any of these attributes. You can also customize this page with attributes relevant to your analytic needs. See the [Custom Attributes section](#use-custom-attributes-to-enrich-your-profiles) to learn how.

### Account profiles 
The Account Profiles page surfaces a list of the organizations interacting with your application.

{{< img src="product_analytics/account_profile_july_25.png" alt="A view of the User profiles page." style="width:80%;" >}}

Each profile includes four default attributes to help you identify and track account activity over time. These default attributes are:
- `account_id`
- `account_name`
- `first_seen`
- `last_seen` 

You can customize the Account Profiles page to include additional attributes, giving you the flexibility to tailor the view to your observability and product analysis needs.



## Use custom attributes to enrich profiles

### How to configure custom attributes using integrations 

Use integrations to automatically import custom attribute data into profiles. This data is synced on a regular schedule, reflecting the latest values from the source system to ensure that profiles remain up-to-date and accurate.

On the [Integrations page][4], you can explore the integrations that are compatible with custom attributes.

On this same page, you can select the [Custom Attributes][5] tab to view imported attributes for user and account profiles.

{{< img src="product_analytics/integration_page3_july_25.png" alt="See the integrations that are compatible with Product Analytics." style="width:80%;" >}}

To import attibutes from an integration such as Salesforce or Snowflake, select the **Add Attributes** button and choose whether the attributes are for user or account profiles. Then, follow the prompts to: 


{{< img src="product_analytics/add_attribute2_button.png" alt="Add new attributes using to enrich your profiles." style="width:80%;" >}}


1. Choose a **source of the data** to be imported.

{{< img src="product_analytics/choose_integration_july_25.png" alt="Choose a source of the data to be imported." style="width:80%;" >}}


2. Select the **table** containing the desired user data, then select the **join keys** to merge the table with your profiles.

{{< img src="product_analytics/add_table_and_key_july_25.png" alt="select the data to be merged with your profiles." style="width:80%;" >}}


3. Choose which **attributes from the integration** to add to your profiles.

### How to configure custom attributes using reference tables 

Importing custom attributes from a reference table follows the same steps as importing from an integration. The exception here is to select the reference table tile in step 1.

## How to query your custom attributes

You can filter these custom attributes throughout the product analytics platform without needing to first add them to a [segment][6]. For example, you can create an analytics chart to view a time series of all users originating from a specific `org_id`.
