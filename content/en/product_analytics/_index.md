## Overview

{{< img src="product_analytics/overview.png" alt="Landing page of Product Analytics.">}}

Product Analytics helps you gain insight into user behavior and make data-driven decisions. It can help solve the following types of use cases in your application:

- Understand product adoption
- Track conversion rates and their evolution over time
- Track key user behavior patterns
- Visualize the most and least interacted with buttons on a given page

By default, Product Analytics data is retained for 15 months. Learn more about [Privacy at Datadog][1].

## Measure user retention

User retention is a metric for measuring the percentage of active users who continue to use your product, app, or service over a set period of time. Use [Retention Analysis][2] to measure how a group of users engage with specific features over time to understand where drop-offs occur.

## Map user journeys

[User journeys][3] allow you to measure and report on the impact of every feature change - from backend bottlenecks to user frustrations - so that they can be appropriately optimized. Identify the ideal path for feature adoption and user conversion.

See different visualizations of the user experience when interacting with your application:

- **[Funnel][4]**: Measure the conversion rate end-to-end of a given workflow.
- **[Sankey][5]**: Explore aggregated workflows in a single visualization to aid in answering questions about user journeys.
- **[Conversion][6]**: Track conversion rates over time and compare it against specific attributes that may have affected conversion rates, such as browser type or geography.

## Create user segments

Segments are users grouped by specific characteristics or behaviors. [Segmentation][7] in Datadog allows you to analyze and understand specific groups or segments of your user base.

## Visualize user interactions with heatmaps

[Heatmaps][8] visualize the most interacted with elements on a page to see where hot spots of activity are, along with analyzing scroll depth to see how far users scrolled down a given page. You can view every swipe, scroll, and click with a pixel-perfect reproduction of exactly what users went through on both browser and mobile applications to identify high-or low-performing content.
