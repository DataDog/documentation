## Overview

The Analytics Explorer contains views data aggregation for understanding how your product is being used. You can control:

* The event type (Sessions, Views, or Actions) to see views by.
* The query that filters the set of views to analyze.
* The dimensions over which to split data.
* The visualization method for aggregates and splits.

With Analytics visualizations, you can:

* Create a widget in a dashboard out of that visualization.
* Dive deeper into subsets of the events list depending on the interactions that the visualization enables.

## Build a query

In [Analytics][1], customize your display by adding facets and measures to your search query. 

1. Select a [view event type][2].

4. Choose a field to [group][3] the measure by.

5. Choose the time interval for your graph. Changing the global timeframe changes the list of available timestep values.
