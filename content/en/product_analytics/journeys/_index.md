## Overview

Journeys help you track user journeys from end-to-end to discover the different ways users navigate through your application. You can extract the data to design your app in a way that users actually use it - not how you think they use it.

## Funnel analysis

With [funnel analysis][1], you can understand the end-to-end conversion of a single key workflow. You can get a detailed drilldown in the sidepanel to understand why conversation rates are what they are. For example, was there a performance issue that caused user dropoff? Are they experiencing an error that occurred in a recent release? Watch a Session Replay of a user who converted or dropped off to see exactly what happened.

## Sankey

[Sankey diagrams][2] allow you to visualize all user journeys across your application to identify the most important contributions to a flow.

## Conversion
