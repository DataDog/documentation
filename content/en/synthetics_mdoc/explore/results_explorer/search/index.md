# Search Test Batches

## Overview{% #overview %}

After selecting a time frame from the dropdown menu on the top right, you can search for batches of CI jobs by clicking on the **CI Batches** event type in the [Synthetic Monitoring & Testing Results Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/explorer/).

You can use facets to accomplish the following actions:

- Observe the latest batches of tests running in a CI pipeline.
- Aggregate CI batches and identify test IDs to add into your CI pipeline.
- Compare the number of failing test runs by their blocking status.

## Explore facets{% #explore-facets %}

The facets panel on the left lists several facets you can use to search through your batches. To start customizing the search query, click through the list of facets starting with **Batch**.
