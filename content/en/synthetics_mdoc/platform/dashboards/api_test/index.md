# Synthetic API Test Performance Dashboard

## Overview{% #overview %}

The [API test performance dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/30695/synthetics---api-test-performance) provides insights about your entire stack and events. It shows:

- **API test types**: View your network levels' average response time, latency, or lookup time, along with transaction timings and response time by location by test type.
