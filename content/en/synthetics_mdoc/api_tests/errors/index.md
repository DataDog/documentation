# API Testing Errors

## HTTP errors{% #http-errors %}

The message `Error performing HTTP/2 request` may occur when a remote server's HTTP support is inconsistent. For example, suppose you run a test that reaches an endpoint on a server that supports HTTP 2. On the next run, if the test comes across the same endpoint on a server that only has HTTP 1.1 support, the test fails to establish an HTTP 2 connection and returns an error. In this scenario, switching to HTTP/1.1 prevents the error.

## SSL errors{% #ssl-errors %}

SSL errors can occur during an API test run. They are different from failing assertions on SSL tests and can occur on all types of API tests.

| `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`          | A self-signed certificate exists in the certificate chain. The certificate chain can be built using the untrusted certificates, but the root CA cannot be found locally.                                                                                                                                      |

| `UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CRL_SIGNATURE`    | The CRL signature cannot be decrypted. (The actual signature value cannot be determined.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL`                  | The certificate revocation list (CRL) is not found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT`          | Unable to find the certificate for one of the certificate authorities (CAs) in the signing hierarchy, and that CA is not trusted by the local application. For example, this error may be thrown when the self-signed root CA, but not the intermediate CA, is missing from the list of trusted certificates. |
| `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`  | The issuer certificate of a locally found certificate is not found. This usually means that the list of trusted certificates is not complete. For example, this error may be thrown when the self-signed root CA and intermediate CA are both missing from the list of trusted certificates.                  |
| `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`    | No signatures are verified because the certificate chain contains only one certificate, which is not self-signed, and the issuer is not trusted.                                                                                                                                                              |
