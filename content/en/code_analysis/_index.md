## Overview

Code Analysis is composed of the [Static Analysis][1] and [Software Composition Analysis (SCA)][2] scan types. 

Static Analysis
: Scans your bespoke code for maintainability issues, bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle to catch issues from reaching production and, when possible, provide suggested fixes to help engineering teams address these issues before they impact users.

Software Composition Analysis 
: Scans the open source libraries that are imported into your repositories for known vulnerabilities. 

Once you have configured Code Analysis, you can head to the [Code Analysis page][9] to see a summary of the results from the Static Analysis and SCA scans for each of your configured repositories. The summarized results will always be for the latest commit on the default branch of each repository to ensure you are seeing all the existing problems on each repository that you may want to triage and fix.

Select a repository from the list to search through and manage violations for that specific repository. By default, the results are filtered to the latest commit on the default branch of the repository, but you may change the branch or commit at the top of the page. Regardless of the selected branch or commit, all results will be organized into the following views:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Code Vulnerabilities" %}}

{{< img src="code_analysis/shopist_code_vulnerabilities.png" alt="Code vulnerabilities on the Code Analysis page for the Datadog Shopist service and repository" style="width:100%;">}}

Identify and address code security risks detected by Static Analysis in the **Code Vulnerabilities** view.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Code Quality" %}}

{{< img src="code_analysis/shopist_code_quality.png" alt="Code quality vulnerabilities on the Code Analysis page for the Datadog Shopist service and repository" style="width:100%;">}}

Identify and address poor coding practices detected by Static Analysis in the **Code Quality** view.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Library Vulnerabilities" %}}

{{< img src="code_analysis/shopist_lib_vulnerabilities.png" alt="Library vulnerabilities on the Code Analysis page for the Datadog Shopist service and repository" style="width:100%;">}}

Identify and address vulnerable open source libraries detected by SCA in the **Library Vulnerabilities** view.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Library List" %}}

{{< img src="code_analysis/shopist_lib_list.png" alt="A list of libraries on the Code Analysis page for the Datadog Shopist service and repository" style="width:100%;">}}

Manage the full list of libraries detected by SCA that have imported into your codebase in the **Library List** view.

With Static Analysis, you can receive automated feedback on poor coding practices and security vulnerabilities on the code you write directly in an IDE such as [VS Code][3] or [IntelliJ & PyCharm][4], and in your [pull requests on GitHub][5]. 

## Set up Code Analysis on your repository

Click **+ Setup a Repository** on the [Code Analysis page][9] and select the relevant programming languages to add Code Analysis to your project. Datadog provides out-of-the-box rulesets for the following languages:

## Set up the GitHub integration 

You must configure a GitHub App using the [GitHub integration tile][7] and set up the [source code integration][8] to see the offending code snippets as part of the Static Analysis results in the Datadog UI.
