Datadog provides out-of-the-box (OOTB) detection rules to flag attacker techniques and potential misconfigurations so that you can immediately take steps to remediate. Datadog continuously develops new default detection rules, which are automatically imported into your account.

Filter by **Logs Detection** to see the Cloud SIEM detection rules, **Workload Security** to see Cloud Security Workload detection rules, **Cloud Configuration** or **Infrastructure Configuration** to see the Cloud Security Posture detection rules.
