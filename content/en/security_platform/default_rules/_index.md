Datadog provides out-of-the-box (OOTB) [detection rules][1] to flag attacker techniques and potential misconfigurations so you can immediately take steps to remediate. Datadog continuously develops new default rules, which are automatically imported into your account, your Application Security Monitoring library, and the Agent, depending on your configuration. For more information, see the Detection Rules documentation.

Click on the buttons below to filter by different parts of the Datadog Security Platform. OOTB rules are available for [Cloud SIEM][2], [Posture Management][3], which is divided into cloud or infrastructure configuration, [Workload Security][4], and [Application Security Monitoring][5].
