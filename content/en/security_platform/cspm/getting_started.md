## Setup

### Product configuration

Select `Posture Management`. You can also configure multiple products at once by selecting their checkbox.

### Assess your cloud environment

Detect misconfigurations in your cloud environment. This section guides you through collecting resource configuration data from cloud providers. Resource configuration collection allows Datadog to assess your environments against Datadog’s out-of-the-box [Cloud Configuration rules][2].

### Assess your host and containers

Evaluate the security posture of your hosts and containers. This section guides you through configuring the Datadog Agent to scan your hosts and containers. Our agent allows Datadog to continuously assess the state of your hosts and containers against Datadog’s out-of-the-box [Infrastructure Configuration rules][3].
