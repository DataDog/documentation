## Overview

Datadog provides [out-of-the-box (OOTB) detection rules][1] to flag potential misconfigurations and help improve your security posture. OOTB detection rules follow the same [conditional logic][2] as all Datadog Security detection rules.

Datadog Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) uses the following rule types to validate the configuration of your cloud infrastructure:

- [Cloud configuration][1]: These detection rules analyze the configuration of resources within your cloud environment. For example, the rule [Cloudfront distribution is encrypted][3] evaluates an AWS Cloudfront distributionâ€™s configuration for encrypted status. Customization of a cloud configuration query directly is not supported at this time, but you can customize how you environment is [scanned][4] for each rule.

- [Infrastructure configuration][5]: These detection rules analyze your containers and Kubernetes clusters to find configuration issues, as defined in the popular CIS compliance benchmarks for Docker and Kubernetes. For example, the rule [/etc/default/docker file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictively][6] evaluates Docker file permissions running on a host.

These detection rules work with out-of-the-box integration configurations and map to controls within a [compliance framework or industry benchmark][4]. When new default configuration detection rules are added, they are automatically imported into your account.
