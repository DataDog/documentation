You can monitor application security for PHP apps running in host-based or container-based environments such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, and AWS EKS.

{{% appsec-getstarted %}}

## Get started

1. **Install the latest Datadog PHP library** by downloading and running the installer:
   ```shell
   wget https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/latest/download/datadog-setup.php -O datadog-setup.php
   php datadog-setup.php --php-bin all --enable-appsec
   ```
   For information about which language and framework versions are supported by the library, see [Compatibility][1].

2. **Enable the library in your code** by restarting PHP-FPM or Apache. In a containerized environment, if you previously installed the library without enabling ASM, you can optionally enable it after by setting the following environment variable:
   {{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker CLI" %}}

Update your configuration container for APM by adding the following argument in your `docker run` command: 

```shell
docker run [...] -e DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true [...] 
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Dockerfile" %}}

Add the following environment variable value to your container Dockerfile:

```shell
ENV DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}

Update your configuration yaml file container for APM and add the AppSec env variable:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <CONTAINER_NAME>
          image: <CONTAINER_IMAGE>/<TAG>
          env:
            - name: DD_APPSEC_ENABLED
              value: "true"
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "AWS ECS" %}}

Update your ECS task definition JSON file, by adding this in the environment section:

```json
"environment": [
  ...,
  {
    "name": "DD_APPSEC_ENABLED",
    "value": "true"
  }
]
```
