## Compatibility

{{< programming-lang-wrapper langs="java,dotnet,go,ruby,php,nodejs" >}}

{{< programming-lang lang="java" >}}

### Supported Java versions

The Datadog library supports Java JRE 1.8 and higher of both Oracle JDK and OpenJDK, on the following architectures:
- Linux (GNU) x86, x86-64
- Alpine Linux (musl) x86, x86-64
- macOS (Darwin) x86, x86-64
- Windows (msvc) x86, x86-64

Datadog does not officially support any early-access versions of Java.

### Supported frameworks

| Framework Web Server    | Minimum Framework Version   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Servlet Compatible      | 2.3+, 3.0+                  |
| Spring                  | 3.1                         |
**Note**: Many application servers are Servlet compatible and are supported by Application Security, such as WebSphere, WebLogic, and JBoss. Also, frameworks like Spring Boot are supported by virtue of using a supported embedded application server (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Netty).

{{< /programming-lang >}}

{{< programming-lang lang="go" >}}

### Supported Go versions

- Linux (GNU) x86-64
- Alpine Linux (musl) x86-64
- macOS (Darwin) x86-64

### Supported frameworks

Integrate the Go tracer with the following list of web frameworks using one of the corresponding APM tracer integration. Click to see the [integrations documentation][1], which provides a detailed overview of the supported packages and their APIs, along with usage examples.

- [gRPC][2]
- [net/http][3]
- [Gorilla Mux][4]
- [Echo][5]
- [Chi][6]
- [HttpRouter][7]

### Enabling CGO

Compiling your code with Application Security enabled involves [CGO][8] and therefore requires:

- The `gcc` compiler for the target `GOOS` and `GOARCH`.
- The C library headers.
- The CGO bindings enabled. This is controlled by the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable which is enabled by default when compiling natively.

To install the above requirements:

| Operating system     | Console command |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Debian, Ubuntu       | `$ apt install gcc libc6-dev`   |
| Alpine               | `$ apk add gcc musl-dev`        |
| RHEL, CentOS, Fedora | `$ yum install gcc glibc-devel` |
| macOS                | `$ xcode-select --install`      |

**Note**: The Go toolchain disables CGO when cross-compiling and so, CGO needs to be explicitly enabled.

## Data security considerations

The data that youâ€™re collecting with Datadog can contain sensitive information that you want to filter out, obfuscate, scrub, filter, modify, or just not collect. Additionally, it may contain synthetic traffic that might cause your threat detection be inaccurate, or cause Datadog to not accurately indicate the security of your services.

The Datadog Agent and some tracing libraries have options available to address these situations and modify or discard spans. See [APM Data Security][1] for details that also apply to Application Security.

## Exclusion filters

There may be a time when an Application Security signal, or a suspicious request, is a false positive. For example, Application Security repeatedly detects
the same suspicious request and a signal is generated, but the signal has been reviewed and is not a threat.

You can set an exclusion filter, which ignore events from a rule, to eliminate these noisy signal patterns and focus on legitimate suspicious requests.

To create an exclusion filter, do one of the following:

- Click on a signal in [Application Security Signals][2] and click the **Create Exclusion Filter** button in the top left corner. This method automatically generates a filter query for the targeted service.
- Navigate to [Exclusion Filters Configuration][3] and manually configure a new exclusion filter based on your own filter query.

**Note**: Requests (traces) matching an exclusion filter are not billed.

## Disable Application Security

To disable Application Security, remove the `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true` environment variable from your application configuration. Once removed, restart your service.

If you need additional help, contact [Datadog support][4].
