## Overview

Detection Rules define conditional logic that is applied to all ingested logs and cloud configurations. When at least one case defined in a rule that is matched over a given period of time, Datadog generates a Security Signal.

For each of monitoring option, there are [default detection rules][1] that work out-of-the-box with integration configuration.

- [Security Monitoring][2] uses log detection to analyze ingested logs in real-time. You can also create [custom rules][3] to tailor to your environment.

- [Cloud Security Posture Management][4] uses cloud configuration and infrastructure configuration rules to scan the state of your cloud environment.

- With [Cloud Workload Security][5], the Datadog Agent actively monitors system activity and evaluates it against a set of rules.

## Creating and managing rules

The [Security Rules][6] page lets you search all Detection Rules. Quickly enable, disable, edit, delete, clone, or view signals generated by any of these rules. To create a custom [security][3] rule, click on the **New Rule** button in the top right corner of the page.

**Note**: Custom rules are only available for Security Monitoring.

### Finding rules

The free text search filters Detection Rules by text in the rule name or query. Query results update in real-time when the query is edited—there is no “Search” button to click.

#### Filter by facet

{{< img src="security_platform/security_monitoring/detection_rules/facets_panel.png" alt="Facets panel" width="75%">}}

Use facets in the left panel to scope a search query by value. For example, if you have several rule sources and need to troubleshoot on rules provided by one source, hover over a source value in the panel, such as `cloudtrail` or `kubernetes`, and click **only** to narrow the search to that source.

By default, all facets are selected. To remove a facet from search, deselect the checkbox.

### Rules table

{{< img src="security_platform/security_monitoring/detection_rules/rules_table2.png" alt="Rules Table"  >}}

Rules are displayed in the rules table.

Columns can be added or removed with the options menu.

Rules are sorted alphabetically—ascending by default (A-Z). The rules can be inverse-sorted by name, query name, creation date, or rule ID.

#### Enabling or disabling a rule

Enable or disable a rule using the toggle switch to the right of the rule.

#### Editing a rule

Edit a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Edit** button.

#### Searching for signals generated by a rule

Search for signals generated by a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **View Generated Signals** button.

#### Cloning a rule

Clone a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Clone** button.

#### Deleting a rule

Delete a rule by hovering over the rule and clicking the **Delete** button.
