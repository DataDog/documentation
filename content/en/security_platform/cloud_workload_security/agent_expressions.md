## Agent expression syntax
Rules for Cloud Workload Security (CWS) are first evaluated in the Datadog Agent to decide what system activity to collect. This portion of a CWS rule is called the Agent expression. Agent expressions use Datadog's Security Language (SECL). The standard format of a SECL expression is as follows:

```
<trigger>.<event-attribute> <operator> <value> <event-attribute> ...
```

Using this format, an example rule looks like this:
```
open.file.path == "/etc/shadow" && file.path not in ["/usr/sbin/vipw"]
```

## Triggers
Triggers are events that correspond to types of activity seen by the system. The currently supported set of triggers is:

| SECL Event           | Type             |  Definition                           | Agent Version |

| `open`               | File             | A file was opened                     | 7.27          |

## Operators
SECL operators are used to combine event attributes together into a full expression. The following operators are available:

| SECL Operator         | Types            |  Definition                           | Agent Version |

| `!=`                  | File             | Not equal                                | 7.27          |
| `>`                   | File             | Greater                                  | 7.27          |

## Helpers
Helpers exist in SECL that enable users to write advanced rules without needing to rely on generic techniques such as regex.

### Command line arguments
The *args_flags* and *args_options* are helpers to ease the writing of CWS rules based on command line arguments.

*args_flags* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters but do not accept any associated value.

Examples:
* `version` is part of *args_flags* for the command `cat --version`
* `l` and `n` both are in *args_flags* for the command `netstat -ln`


*args_options* is used to catch arguments that start with either one or two hyphen characters and accepts a value either specified as the same argument but separated by the ‘=’ character or specified as the next argument.

Examples:
* `T=8` and `width=8` both are in *args_options* for the command `ls -T 8 --width=8`
* `exec.args_options ~= [ “s=.*\’” ]` can be used to detect `sudoedit` was launched with `-s` argument and a command that ends with a `\`

### File rights

The *file.rights* attribute can now be used in addition to *file.mode*. *file.mode* can hold values set by the kernel, while the *file.rights* only holds the values set by the user. These rights may be more familiar because they are in the `chmod` commands.
