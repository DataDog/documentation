Use Observability Pipelines' rsyslog or syslog-ng to receive logs sent to rsyslog or syslog-ng. Select and set up this source when you [set up a pipeline][1].

You can also [forward third-party log to syslog](#forward-third-party-logs-to-syslog) and then send them to the Observability Pipelines Worker.

## Forward third-party logs to the Observability Pipelines Worker

Syslog is a widely used logging protocol for sending network logs to a central server. Many network devices support syslog output, so you can forward third-party logs to the Observability Pipelines's syslog source for processing and routing. Examples of these third-party services include:

### Fortinet
- [Configure log forwarding][2]
- [Configuring syslog settings][3]

### Palo Alto Networks
- [Configure log forwarding][4]
- [Forward traffic logs to a syslog server][5]
