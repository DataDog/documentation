After setting up your pipeline and installing the Worker:

- If you are trying to troubleshooting an issue with the Observability Pipelines Worker, see [Worker CLI Commands][1] on how to see the raw data sent to the Worker.
- You can track the status of your pipelines and components with health graphs and out-of-the-box monitors. See [Monitoring Pipelines][2] for more information.
- You can also create your monitors, dashboards, and notebooks to monitor your pipelines. See [Pipeline Usage Metrics][3] for a list of metrics.
