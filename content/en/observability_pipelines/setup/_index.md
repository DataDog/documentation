## Overview

The [Observability Pipelines Worker][1] can collect, process, and route logs from any source to any destination. Using Datadog, you can build and manage all of your Observability Pipelines Worker deployments at scale.

There are several ways to get started with the Observability Pipelines Worker.

- [Quickstart](#quickstart): Install the Worker with a simple pipeline that emits demo data to get started quickly.
- [Datadog setup guide][2]: Install the Worker with an out-of-the-box pipeline for receiving and routing data from your Datadog Agents to Datadog.
- [Datadog archiving setup guide][3]: Install the Worker with an out-of-the-box pipeline for receiving and routing data from your Datadog Agents to Datadog and S3.
- [Splunk setup guide][4]: Install the Worker with an out-of-the-box pipeline for receiving and routing data from Splunk HEC to both Splunk and Datadog.

This document walks you through the quickstart installation steps and then provides resources for next steps.

## Deployment Modes

{{% op-deployment-modes %}}

## Prerequisites

To install the Observability Pipelines Worker, you need the following:

- A valid [Datadog API key][5].
- A pipeline ID.

To generate a new API key and pipeline:

1. Navigate to [Observability Pipelines][6].
2. Click **New Pipeline**.
3. Enter a name for your pipeline.
4. Click **Next**.
4. Select the template you want and follow the instructions.

## Quickstart

Follow the below instructions to install the Worker and deploy a sample pipeline configuration that uses demo data.

### Install the Observability Pipelines Worker

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker" %}}

The Observability Pipelines Worker Docker image is published to Docker Hub [here][1].

1. Download the [sample pipeline configuration file][2]. This configuration emits demo data, parses and structures the data, and then sends them to the console and Datadog. See [Configurations][3] for more information about the source, transform, and sink used in the sample configuration.

2. Run the following command to start the Observability Pipelines Worker with Docker:
    
    ```shell
    docker run -i -e DD_API_KEY=<API_KEY> \
      -e DD_OP_PIPELINE_ID=<PIPELINE_ID> \
      -e DD_SITE=<SITE> \
      -p 8282:8282 \
      -v ./pipeline.yaml:/etc/observability-pipelines-worker/pipeline.yaml:ro \
      datadog/observability-pipelines-worker run
    ```

    Replace `<API_KEY>` with your Datadog API key, `<PIPELINES_ID>` with your Observability Pipelines configuration ID, and `<SITE>` with {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}. **Note**: `./pipeline.yaml` must be the relative or absolute path to the configuration you downloaded in step 1.

{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
1. Download the [Helm chart values file][1] for AWS EKS. See [Configurations][2] for more information about the source, transform, and sink used in the sample configuration.

2. In the Helm chart, replace the `datadog.apiKey` and `datadog.pipelineId` values to match your pipeline and use {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}} for the `site` value. Then, install it in your cluster with the following commands:

    ```shell
