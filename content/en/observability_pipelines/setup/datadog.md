## Overview

The [Observability Pipelines Worker][1] can collect, process, and route logs from any source to any destination. Using Datadog, you can build and manage all of your Observability Pipelines Worker deployments at scale.

This guide walks you through deploying the Worker in your common tools cluster and configuring the Datadog Agent to send logs and metrics to the Worker.

{{< img src="observability_pipelines/setup/opw-dd-pipeline.png" alt="A diagram of a couple of workload clusters sending their data through the Observability Pipelines aggregator." >}}

## Deployment Modes

{{% op-deployment-modes %}}

## Assumptions
* You are already using Datadog and want to use Observability Pipelines.
* You have administrative access to the clusters where the Observability Pipelines Worker is going to be deployed, as well as to the workloads that are going to be aggregated.
* You have a common tools or security cluster for your environment to which all other clusters are connected.

## Prerequisites
Before installing, make sure you have:

* A valid [Datadog API key][2].
* A Pipeline ID.

You can generate both of these in [Observability Pipelines][3].

### Provider-specific requirements
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker" %}}
Ensure that your machine is configured to run Docker.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
To run the Worker on your Kubernetes nodes, you need a minimum of two nodes with one CPU and 512MB RAM available. Datadog recommends creating a separate node pool for the Workers, which is also the recommended configuration for production deployments.

* The [EBS CSI driver][1] is required. To see if it is installed, run the following command and look for `ebs-csi-controller` in the list:

  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system
  ```

* A `StorageClass` is required for the Workers to provision the correct EBS drives. To see if it is installed already, run the following command and look for `io2` in the list:

  ```shell
  kubectl get storageclass
  ```

  If `io2` is not present, download [the StorageClass YAML][2] and `kubectl apply` it.

* The [AWS Load Balancer controller][3] is required. To see if it is installed, run the following command and look for `aws-load-balancer-controller` in the list:

  ```shell
  helm list -A
  ```
* Datadog recommends using Amazon EKS >= 1.16.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "CloudFormation" %}}

<div class="alert alert-danger">Only use CloudFormation installs for non-production-level workloads.</div>

To install the Worker in your AWS Account, use the CloudFormation template to create a Stack:

  1. Download [the CloudFormation template][1] for the Worker.

  2. In the **CloudFormation console**, click **Create stack**, and select the **With new resources (standard)** option.

  3. Make sure that the **Template is ready** option is selected, and select **Upload a template file**. Click **Choose file** and add the CloudFormation template file you downloaded earlier. Click **Next**.

  4. Enter a name for the stack in **Specify stack details**.

  5. Fill in the parameters for the CloudFormation template. A few require special attention:

      * For `APIKey` and `PipelineID`, provide the key and ID that you gathered earlier in the Prerequisites section.
    
      * For the `VPCID` and `SubnetIDs`, provide the subnets and VPC you chose earlier.

      * All other parameters are set to reasonable defaults for a Worker deployment but you can adjust them for your use case as needed.
  
  6. Click **Next**.

  7. Review and make sure the parameters are as expected. Click the necessary permissions checkboxes for IAM, and click **Submit** to create the Stack.

CloudFormation handles the installation at this point; the Worker instances are launched, download the necessary software, and start running automatically.

### Load balancing

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker" %}}
Production-oriented setup is not included in the Docker instructions. Instead, refer to your company's standards for load balancing in containerized environments. If you are testing on your local machine, configuring a load balancer is unnecessary.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
Use the load balancers provided by your cloud provider.
They adjust based on autoscaling events that the default Helm setup is configured for. The load balancers are internal-facing,
so they are only accessible inside your network.

Use the load balancer URL given to you by Helm when you configure the Datadog Agent.

NLBs provisioned by the [AWS Load Balancer Controller][1] are used.

See [Capacity Planning and Scaling][2] for load balancer recommendations when scaling the Worker.
#### Cross-availability-zone load balancing
The provided Helm configuration tries to simplify load balancing, but you must take into consideration the potential price implications of cross-AZ traffic. Wherever possible, the samples try to avoid creating situations where multiple cross-AZ hops can happen.

The sample configurations do not enable the cross-zone load balancing feature available in this controller. To enable it, add the following annotation to the `service` block:

```
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-attributes: load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled=true
```

See [AWS Load Balancer Controller][3] for more details.

### Buffering
Observability Pipelines includes multiple buffering strategies that allow you to increase the resilience of your cluster to downstream faults. The provided sample configurations use disk buffers, the capacities of which are rated for approximately 10 minutes of data at 10Mbps/core for Observability Pipelines deployments. That is often enough time for transient issues to resolve themselves, or for incident responders to decide what needs to be done with the observability data.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker" %}}
By default, the Observability Pipelines Worker's data directory is set to `/var/lib/observability-pipelines-worker`. Make sure that your host machine has a sufficient amount of storage capacity allocated to the container's mountpoint.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
For AWS, Datadog recommends using the `io2` EBS drive family. Alternatively, the `gp3` drives could also be used.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Azure AKS" %}}
For Azure AKS, Datadog recommends using the `default` (also known as `managed-csi`) disks.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Google GKE" %}}
For Google GKE, Datadog recommends using the `premium-rwo` drive class because it is backed by SSDs. The HDD-backed class, `standard-rwo`, might not provide enough write performance for the buffers to be useful.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "APT-based Linux" %}}
By default, the Observability Pipelines Worker's data directory is set to `/var/lib/observability-pipelines-worker` - if you are using the sample configuration, you should ensure that this has at least 288GB of space available for buffering.

Where possible, it is recommended to have a separate SSD mounted at that location.

## Connect the Datadog Agent to the Observability Pipelines Worker
To send Datadog Agent logs to the Observability Pipelines Worker, update your agent configuration with the following:

```yaml
observability_pipelines_worker:
  logs:
    enabled: true
    url: "http://<OPW_HOST>:8282"
```

`OPW_HOST` is the IP of the load balancer or machine you set up earlier. For single-host Docker-based installs, this is the IP address of the underlying host. For Kubernetes-based installs, you can retrieve it by running the following command and copying the `EXTERNAL-IP`:

```shell
kubectl get svc opw-observability-pipelines-worker
```

For Terraform installs, the `lb-dns` output provides the necessary value. For CloudFormation installs, the `LoadBalancerDNS` CloudFormation output has the correct URL to use.

At this point, your observability data should be going to the Worker and is available for data processing.

## Updating deployment modes

{{% op-updating-deployment-modes %}}

## Working with data
The sample configuration provided has example processing steps that demonstrate Observability Pipelines tools and ensures that data sent to Datadog is in the correct format.

### Processing logs
The sample Observability Pipelines configuration does the following:
- Collects logs sent from the Datadog agent to the Observability Pipelines Worker.
- Tags logs coming through the Observability Pipelines Worker. This helps determine what traffic still needs to be shifted over to the Worker as you update your clusters. These tags also show you how logs are being routed through the load balancer, in case there are imbalances.
- Corrects the status of logs coming through the Worker. Due to how the Datadog Agent collects logs from containers, the provided `.status` attribute does not properly reflect the actual level of the message. It is removed to prevent issues with parsing rules in the backend, where logs are received from the Worker.

The following are two important components in the example configuration:
- `logs_parse_ddtags`: Parses the tags that are stored in a string into structured data.
- `logs_finish_ddtags`: Re-encodes the tags so that it is in the format as how the Datadog Agent would send it.

Internally, the Datadog Agent represents log tags as a CSV in a single string. To effectively manipulate these tags, they must be parsed, modified, and then re-encoded before they are sent to the ingest endpoint. These steps are written to automatically perform those actions for you. Any modifications you make to the pipeline, especially for manipulating tags, should be in between these two steps.

At this point, your environment is configured for Observability Pipelines with data flowing through it. Further configuration is likely required for your specific use cases, but the tools provided give you a starting point.
