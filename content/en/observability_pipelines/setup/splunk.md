{{< callout url="#" btn_hidden="true" header="Limited Protocol Support" >}}
  Observability Pipelines only supports Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) protocol at this time.
{{< /callout >}}

## Overview

The [Observability Pipelines Worker][1] can collect, process, and route logs and metrics from any source to any destination. Using Datadog, you can build and manage all of your Observability Pipelines Worker deployments at scale.

This guide walks you through deploying the Worker in your common tools cluster and configuring Splunk to send logs through the Worker, to dual-write to Datadog.

{{< img src="observability_pipelines/guide/splunk/setup.png" alt="A diagram of a couple of Splunk Heavy Forwarders sending their data through the Observability Pipelines aggregator." >}}

## Assumptions
* You are using a log collector that is compatible with the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) protocol.
* You have administrative access to the collectors and the Splunk Index.
* You have administrative access to the clusters where the Observability Pipelines Worker is going to be deployed.
* You have a common tools or security cluster for your environment to which all other clusters are connected.

## Prerequisites
Before installing, make sure you have:

* A valid [Datadog API key][2].
* A Pipeline ID.

You can generate both of these in [Observability Pipelines][3].

You will also need a Splunk index to send logs to.

### Provider-specific requirements
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
To run the Worker on your Kubernetes nodes, you need a minimum of two nodes with one CPU and 512MB RAM available. Datadog recommends creating a separate node pool for the Workers, which is also the recommended configuration for production deployments.

* The [AWS Load Balancer controller][1] is required. To see if it is installed, run the following command and look for `aws-load-balancer-controller` in the list:

  ```shell
  helm list -A
  ```
* Datadog recommends using Amazon EKS >= 1.16.

## Setting up the Splunk Index
In order to receive logs from the Observability Pipelines Worker, you will need to provision a HEC input and HEC token on the index.

Under **Settings > Data Inputs**, add a new HTTP Event Collector input. You can name it whatever you wish.

{{< callout url="#" btn_hidden="true" header="Acknowledgements" >}}
  Observability Pipelines supports acknolwedgements when you enable the <strong>Enable Indexer Acknowledgements</strong> setting on this input.
{{< /callout >}}

Select whichever index(es) you wish for logs to flow into.

Once the input is created, Splunk will create a token for you, usually in a UUID format. In the sample configurations below, you will add this token so that the Observability Pipelines Worker can authenticate itself.

## Installing the Observability Pipelines Worker

{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
1. Download the [Helm chart][1] for AWS EKS.

2. In the Helm chart, replace the `datadog.apiKey` and `datadog.pipelineId` values to match your pipeline. Then, replace the values for `SPLUNK_ENDPOINT` and `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` to match your Splunk deployment (and the token you created above). Then, install it in your cluster with the following commands:

### Load balancing

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
Use the load balancers provided by your cloud provider.
They adjust based on autoscaling events that the default Helm setup is configured for. The load balancers are internal-facing,
so they are only accessible inside your network.

Use the load balancer URL given to you by Helm when you configure the Datadog Agent.

NLBs provisioned by the [AWS Load Balancer Controller][1] are used.

#### Cross-availability-zone load balancing
The provided Helm configuration tries to simplify load balancing, but you must take into consideration the potential price implications of cross-AZ traffic. Wherever possible, the samples try to avoid creating situations where multiple cross-AZ hops can happen.

The sample configurations do not enable the cross-zone load balancing feature available in this controller. To enable it, add the following annotation to the `service` block:

```
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-attributes: load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled=true
```

See [AWS Load Balancer Controller][2] for more details.

Global Access is enabled by default since that is likely required for use in a shared tools cluster.

No built-in support for load-balancing is provided, given the single-machine nature of the installation. You will need to provision your own load balancers using whatever your company's standard is.

### Buffering
Observability Pipelines includes multiple buffering strategies that allow you to increase the resilience of your cluster to downstream faults. The provided sample configurations use disk buffers, the capacities of which are rated for approximately 10 minutes of data at 10Mbps/core for Observability Pipelines deployments. That is often enough time for transient issues to resolve themselves, or for incident responders to decide what needs to be done with the observability data.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "AWS EKS" %}}
For AWS, Datadog recommends using the `io2` EBS drive family. Alternatively, the `gp3` drives could also be used.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Azure AKS" %}}
For Azure AKS, Datadog recommends using the `default` (also known as `managed-csi`) disks.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Google GKE" %}}
For Google GKE, Datadog recommends using the `premium-rwo` drive class because it is backed by SSDs. The HDD-backed class, `standard-rwo`, might not provide enough write performance for the buffers to be useful.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "APT-based Linux" %}}
By default, the Observability Pipelines Worker's data directory is set to `/var/lib/observability-pipelines-worker` - if you are using the sample configuration, you should ensure that this has at least 288GB of space available for buffering.

Where possible, it is recommended to have a separate SSD mounted at that location.

## Connect forwarder(s) to the Worker
Once you have the Observability Pipelines Worker installed and configured to send to your Splunk index, you must update your existing collectors to point at the Worker.

For most collectors that exist, simply changing the URL (and token) should suffice.

At this point, your logs should be going to the Worker and is available for processing. The next section goes through what process is included by default, and the additional options that are available.

## Working with data
The sample configurations provided does the following:

- **Tag logs coming through the Observability Pipelines Worker.** This helps determine what traffic still needs to be shifted over to the Worker as you update your clusters. These tags also show you how logs are being routed through the load balancer, in case there are imbalances.
- **Dual-writes to Datadog.** This demonstrates how easy it is to write to multiple destinations.
