## Overview

Observability Pipelines' processors enable you to add, edit, and remove log fields. Remapping attributes or rewriting values ensures your logs are processed and standardized properly. For the majority of processing use cases, use the Edit Fields processor to add, remap, or remove fields from your logs. For advanced use cases, use the Custom Processor to conditionally modify fields or rewrite a field's value.

## About reserved attributes

In Datadog, [reserved attributes][1] are log fields that are set aside for specific processing in the platform. Reserved attributes include ` host`, `source`, `status`, `service`, `trace_id`, and `message`. For Observability Pipelines, there are restrictions around how you can handle these attributes.

Reserved attributes are applied when routing logs to the following destinations:
- Datadog
- Amazon S3 (for Log Archives)
- Azure Blob Storage (for Log Archives)
- Google Cloud Storage (for Log Archives)

## Remap the value of reserved attributes

To change or override the value of an existing reserved attribute field, Datadog recommends two approaches using Observability Pipelines. The first uses the Edit Fields processor, and the second uses the Custom Processor.

### Use an Edit Fields processor for basic field assignments

1. Use a **Remove field** processor to drop the reserved attribute from the log.
2. Use an **Add field** processor to add the reserved attribute back to the log with your correct field name and value assignment.

**Note**: In terms of the processor order, the **Add Field** processor should go immediately after the **Remove Field** processor to ensure correct field remapping.

#### Example
The **Remove field** processor image below removes the improperly named `service` field from the log.

The **Add field** processor image below re-adds the `service` field back with the correct value.

### Use the Custom Processor for dynamic or manual assignments

Use the **Custom Processor** to rewrite the reserved attribute's value.

#### Dynamically assign the value using template syntax to reference another field's value.

The following Custom Processor script rewrites the `service` field and dynamically assigns the value of `app_id` to the `service` field's value.

```
.service = {{.app_id}}
```

In the below example image, the input shows `service` with the value `wrongstatus`. After processing the log with the script, the output shows `service` with the value of `streaming-service`, which is `app_id`'s value.

#### Manually rewrite the value of an attribute with a static name

The following Custom Processor script sets the `status` field to the static value `info`.

```
.status = "info"
```

In the below example image, the input shows `status` with the value `wrongstatus`. After processing the log with the script, the output shows `status` with `info` as assigned.
