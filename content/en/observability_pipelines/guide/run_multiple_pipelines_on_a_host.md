## Overview

If you want to run multiple pipelines on a single host to send logs from different sources, you need to manually add the Worker files for any additional Workers. This document explains which files you need to add and modify to run those Workers.

## Prerequisites

[Set up the first pipeline][1] and install the Worker on your host.

## Create an additional pipeline

[Set up another pipeline][1] for the additional Worker that you want to run on the same host. When you reach the Install page, follow the below steps to run the Worker for this pipeline.

## Run the Worker for the additional pipeline

When you installed the first Worker, by default you have:

- A service binary: `/usr/bin/observability-pipelines-worker`
- A service definition file that looks like:
    {{< code-block lang="bash" filename="/lib/systemd/system/observability-pipelines-worker.service" >}}
    [Unit]
    Description="Observability Pipelines Worker"
    Documentation=https://docs.datadoghq.com/observability_pipelines/
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=observability-pipelines-worker
    Group=observability-pipelines-worker
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/observability-pipelines-worker run
    Restart=always
    AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/observability-pipelines-worker

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    {{< /code-block >}}
- An environment file that looks like:
    {{< code-block lang="bash" filename="/etc/default/observability-pipelines-worker" >}}
    DD_API_KEY=<datadog_api_key>
    DD_SITE=<dd_site>
    DD_OP_PIPELINE_ID=<pipeline_id>
    {{< /code-block >}}
- A data directory: `/var/lib/observability-pipelines-worker`

### Configure the additional Worker

For this example, another pipeline was created with the Fluent source. To configure a Worker for this pipeline:

1. Run the following command to create a new data directory, replacing `op-fluent` with a directory name that fits your use case:
    ```shell
    sudo mkdir /var/lib/op-fluent
    ```
1. Run the following command to change the owner of the data directory to `observability-pipelines-worker:observability-pipelines-worker`. Make sure to update `op-fluent` to your data directory's name.
    ```
    sudo chown -R observability-pipelines-worker:observability-pipelines-worker /var/lib/op-fluent/
    ```
1. Create an environment file for the new systemd service, such as `/etc/default/op-fluent` where `op-fluent` is replaced with your specific filename. Example of the file content:
    {{< code-block lang="bash" filename="/etc/default/op-fluent" >}}
    DD_API_KEY=<datadog_api_key>
    DD_OP_PIPELINE_ID=<pipeline_id>
    DD_SITE=<dd_site>
    <destintation_environment_variables>
    DD_OP_SOURCE_FLUENT_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:9091
    DD_OP_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/op-fluent
    {{< /code-block >}}
    In this example:
    -  `DD_OP_DATA_DIR` is set to `/var/lib/op-fluent`. Replace `/var/lib/op-fluent` with the path to your data directory.
    - `DD_OP_SOURCE_FLUENT_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:9091` is the environment variable required for the Fluent source in this example. Replace it with the [environment variable][2] for your source.
    
    Also, make sure to replace:
    - `<datadog_api_key>` with your [Datadog API key][3].
    - `<pipeline_id>` with the ID of the [pipeline][1] for this Worker.
    - `<dd_site>` with your [Datadog Site][4].
    - `<destination_environment_variables>` with the [environment variables][2] for your destinations.
1. Create a new systemd service entry, such as `/lib/systemd/system/op-fluent.service`. Example content for the entry:
    {{< code-block lang="bash" filename="/lib/systemd/system/op-fluent.service" >}}
    [Unit]
    Description="OPW for Fluent Pipeline"
    Documentation=https://docs.datadoghq.com/observability_pipelines/
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=observability-pipelines-worker
    Group=observability-pipelines-worker
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/observability-pipelines-worker run
    Restart=always
    AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/op-fluent

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    {{< /code-block >}}
    In this example:
    - The service name is `op-fluent` because the pipeline is using the Fluent source. Replace `op-fluent.service` with a service name for your use case.
    - The `Description` is `OPW for Fluent Pipeline`. Replace `OPW for Fluent Pipeline` with a  description for your use case.
    - `EnvironmentFile` is set to `-/etc/default/op-fluent`. Replace `-/etc/default/op-fluent` with the systemd service environment variables file you created for your Worker.
1. Run this command to reload systemd:
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
1. Run this command to start the new service:
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl enable --now op-fluent
    ```
1. Run this command to verify the service is running:
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl status op-fluent
    ```

Additionally, you can use the command `sudo journalctl -u op-fluent.service` to help you debug any issues.

## Deploy the pipeline

1.  Navigate to the additional pipeline's Install page.
1.  In the **Deploy your pipeline** section, you should see your additional Worker detected. Click **Deploy**.
