# Configuration
<table><thead><tr><td>Param</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>auth</td><td>Configuration of the authentication strategy for HTTP requests.

HTTP authentication should almost always be used with HTTPS only, as the authentication credentials are passed as an
HTTP header without any additional encryption beyond what is provided by the transport itself.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.password</td><td>The basic authentication password.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.strategy</td><td>The authentication strategy to use.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.token</td><td>The bearer authentication token.</td></tr><tr><td>auth.user</td><td>The basic authentication username.</td></tr><tr><td>endpoint_tag</td><td>The tag name added to each event representing the scraped instance's endpoint.

The tag value will be the endpoint of the scraped instance.</td></tr><tr><td>endpoints</td><td>Endpoints to scrape metrics from.</td></tr><tr><td>honor_labels</td><td>Controls how tag conflicts are handled if the scraped source has tags to be added.

If `true`, the new tag is not added if the scraped metric has the tag already. If `false`, the conflicting tag
is renamed by prepending `exported_` to the original name.

This matches Prometheus’ `honor_labels` configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>instance_tag</td><td>The tag name added to each event representing the scraped instance's host:port.

The tag value will be the host/port of the scraped instance.</td></tr><tr><td>query</td><td>Custom parameters for the scrape request query string.

One or more values for the same parameter key can be provided. The parameters provided in this option are
appended to any parameters manually provided in the `endpoints` option. This option is especially useful when
scraping the `/federate` endpoint.</td></tr><tr><td>query.*</td><td>A query string parameter.</td></tr><tr><td>scrape_interval_secs</td><td>The interval between scrapes, in seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy</td><td>Proxy configuration.

Configure to proxy traffic through an HTTP(S) proxy when making external requests.

Similar to common proxy configuration convention, users can set different proxies
to use based on the type of traffic being proxied, as well as set specific hosts that
should not be proxied.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.enabled</td><td>Enables proxying support.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.http</td><td>Proxy endpoint to use when proxying HTTP traffic.

Must be a valid URI string.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.https</td><td>Proxy endpoint to use when proxying HTTPS traffic.

Must be a valid URI string.</td></tr><tr><td>proxy.no_proxy</td><td>A list of hosts to avoid proxying.

Multiple patterns are allowed:

| Pattern             | Example match                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain names        | `example.com` matches requests to `example.com`                     |
| Wildcard domains    | `.example.com` matches requests to `example.com` and its subdomains |
| IP addresses        | `127.0.0.1` matches requests to `127.0.0.1`                         |
| [CIDR][cidr] blocks | `192.168.0.0/16` matches requests to any IP addresses in this range     |
| Splat               | `*` matches all hosts                                                   |

[cidr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing</td></tr><tr><td>tls</td><td>TLS configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.alpn_protocols</td><td>Sets the list of supported ALPN protocols.

Declare the supported ALPN protocols, which are used during negotiation with peer. Prioritized in the order
they are defined.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.ca_file</td><td>Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file.

The certificate must be in the DER or PEM (X.509) format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.crt_file</td><td>Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this server.

The certificate must be in DER, PEM (X.509), or PKCS#12 format. Additionally, the certificate can be provided as
an inline string in PEM format.

If this is set, and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_file` must also be set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_file</td><td>Absolute path to a private key file used to identify this server.

The key must be in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format. Additionally, the key can be provided as an inline string in PEM format.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.key_pass</td><td>Passphrase used to unlock the encrypted key file.

This has no effect unless `key_file` is set.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_certificate</td><td>Enables certificate verification.

If enabled, certificates must be valid in terms of not being expired, as well as being issued by a trusted
issuer. This verification operates in a hierarchical manner, checking that not only the leaf certificate (the
certificate presented by the client/server) is valid, but also that the issuer of that certificate is valid, and
so on until reaching a root certificate.

Relevant for both incoming and outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the validity of certificates.</td></tr><tr><td>tls.verify_hostname</td><td>Enables hostname verification.

If enabled, the hostname used to connect to the remote host must be present in the TLS certificate presented by
the remote host, either as the Common Name or as an entry in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

Only relevant for outgoing connections.

Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.</td></tr><tr><td>type</td><td>The component type. This is a required field for all components and tells Vector which component to use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# How It Works
## Duplicate tag names
Multiple tags with the same name are invalid within Prometheus. Prometheus
itself will reject a metric with duplicate tags. Vector will accept the metric,
but will only take the last value for each tag name specified.

## State
This component is stateless, meaning its behavior is consistent across each input.

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Vector uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) for TLS protocols. You can
adjust TLS behavior via the `tls.*` options.

## Context
By default, the `prometheus_scrape` source augments events with helpful
context keys.
