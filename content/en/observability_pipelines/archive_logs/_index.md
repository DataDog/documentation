## Overview

Use Observability Pipelines to route ingested logs to a Amazon S3 bucket in Datadog rehydratable format. You can then rehydrate the archive in Datadog ad hoc whenever you need to analyze and investigate them. This is useful when:

- You are migrating from another log vendor to Datadog Log Management, and want to ensure you have access to historical logs when you finish migrating.
- You have a high volume of noisy logs, but you may need to index them in Log Management ad hoc.
- You have a retention policy.
