## Overview

This document explains bootstrapping for the Observability Pipelines Worker.

## Bootstrap Options

<div class="alert alert-warning">All configuration file paths specified in the pipeline need to be under <code>DD_OP_DATA_DIR/config</code>.
Modifying files under that location while OPW is running might have adverse effects.
</div>

Bootstrap the Observability Pipelines Worker within your infrastructure before you set up a pipeline. These environment variables are separate from the pipeline environment variables. The location of the related directories and files:

- Default data directory: `var/lib/observability-pipelines-worker`
- Bootstrap file: `/etc/observability-pipelines-worker/bootstrap.yaml`
- Environment variables file: `/etc/default/observability-pipelines-worker`

To set bootstrap options, do one of the following:
- Use environmental variables.
- Create a `bootstrap.yaml` and start the Worker instance with `--bootstrap-config /path/to/bootstrap.yaml`.

The following is a list of bootstrap options, their related pipeline environment variables, and which variables have a higher precedence (priority).

`api_key`
: **Pipeline environment variable**: `DD_API_KEY`
: **Priority**: `DD_API_KEY`
: Create a [Datadog API key][1] for this environment variable.

`pipeline_id`
: **Pipeline environment variable**: `DD_OP_PIPELINE_ID`
: **Priority**: `DD_OP_PIPELINE_ID`
: Create an [Observability Pipelines pipeline ID][2] for this environment variable.

`site`
: **Pipeline environment variable**: `DD_SITE`
: **Priority**: `DD_SITE`
: Your Datadog site (optional, default: `datadoghq.com`).
: See [Getting Started with Sites][3] for more information.

`data_dir`
: **Pipeline environment variable**: `DD_OP_DATA_DIR`
: **Priority**: `DD_OP_DATA_DIR`
: The data directory (optional, default: `/var/lib/observability-pipelines-worker`). This is the file system directory that the Observability Pipelines Worker uses for local state.

`tags: []`
: **Pipeline environment variable**: `DD_OP_TAGS`
: **Priority**: `DD_OP_TAGS`
: The tags reported with internal metrics and can be used to filter Observability Pipelines instances for Remote Configuration deployments.

`threads`
: **Pipeline environment variable**: `DD_OP_THREADS`
: **Priority**: `DD_OP_THREADS`
: The number of threads to use for processing (optional, default: the number of available cores).

`proxy`
: This option is available for Observability Pipelines Worker 2.1 and later.
: **Pipeline environment variables**: `DD_PROXY_HTTP`, `DD_PROXY_HTTPS`, `DD_PROXY_NO_PROXY`
: Set proxy servers for the Observability Pipelines Worker. The proxy configuration for the Worker works in the same way as it does for the [Datadog Agent][4].
: **Priority**: The settings are applied to the entire Worker process. The HTTP proxy and HTTPS values are resolved in this order:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. `DD_PROXY_HTTP(S)`
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. `HTTP(S)_PROXY`
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. `proxy`
:
: An example proxy configuration:
: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proxy:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enabled: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https: https://foo.bar:3128
: <b>Note</b>: The `DD_PROXY_HTTP(S)` and `HTTP(S)_PROXY` environment variables need to be already exported in your environment for the Worker to resolve them. They cannot be prepended to the Worker installation script.
