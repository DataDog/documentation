## Overview

Observability Pipelines allow you to collect, process, and route observability data (logs, metrics, and traces) from any source to any destination in infrastructure that you own or manage. With Observability Pipelines, you can:

- Control your data volume before routing to manage costs.
- Route data anywhere to reduce vendor lock-in and simplify migrations.
- Transform logs and metrics by adding, parsing, enriching, and removing fields and tags.
- Redact sensitive data from your telemetry data.

The Observability Pipelines Worker is the software that runs in your infrastructure. It aggregates and centrally processes and routes your data. More specifically, the Worker can:

- Receive or pull all your observability data collected by your agents, collectors, or forwarders.
- Transform ingested data (for example: parse, filter, sample, enrich, and more).
- Route the processed data to any destination.

The Datadog UI provides a control plane to manage your Observability Pipelines Workers. You can monitor your pipelines to understand the health of your pipelines, identify bottlenecks and latencies, fine-tune performance, validate data delivery, and investigate your largest volume contributors. You can build or edit pipelines, whether it be routing a subset of data to a new destination or introducing a new sensitive data redaction rule, and roll out these changes to your active pipelines from the Datadog UI.

## Explore Observability Pipelines

Start getting insights into your Observability Pipelines:

###  Collect data from any source and route data to any destination

Collect logs, metrics, and traces from any source and route them to any destination to reduce vendor lock-in and simplify migrations.

### Control your data volume before it gets routed

Optimize volume and reduce the size of your observability data by sampling, filtering, deduplicating, and aggregating your logs and metrics. Govern your telemetry by enforcing data standards and controlling tags for metrics.

### Redact sensitive data from your telemetry data

Redact sensitive data before they are routed outside of your infrastructure, using out-of-the-box patterns to scan for PII, PCI, private keys, and more.

### Monitor the health of your pipelines

Get a holistic view of all of your pipelines' topologies and monitor key performance indicators, such as average load, error rate, and throughput for each of your flows.
