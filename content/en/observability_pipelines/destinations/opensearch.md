Use Observability Pipelines' OpenSearch destination to send logs to OpenSearch.

## Setup

Set up the OpenSearch destination and its environment variables when you [set up a pipeline][1]. The information below is configured in the pipelines UI.

### Set up the destination

1. Optionally, enter the name of the OpenSearch index. See [template syntax][3] if you want to route logs to different indexes based on specific fields in your logs.
1. Optionally, toggle the switch to enable **Buffering Options**.<br>**Note**: Buffering options is in Preview. Contact your account manager to request access.
	- If left disabled, the maximum size for buffering is 500 events.
	- If enabled:
		1. Select the buffer type you want to set (**Memory** or **Disk**).
		1. Enter the buffer size and select the unit.

### Set the environment variables

## How the destination works

### Event batching

A batch of events is flushed when one of these parameters is met. See [event batching][2] for more information.

| Max Events     | Max Bytes       | Timeout (seconds)   |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| None           | 10,000,000      | 1                   |
