Use Observability Pipelines' Amazon OpenSearch destination to send logs to Amazon OpenSearch.

## Setup

Set up the Amazon OpenSearch destination and its environment variables when you [set up a pipeline][1]. The information below is configured in the pipelines UI.

### Set up the destination

{{% observability_pipelines/destination_settings/amazon_opensearch %}}

### Set the environment variables

{{% observability_pipelines/configure_existing_pipelines/destination_env_vars/amazon_opensearch %}}

## How the destination works

### Event batching

A batch of events is flushed when one of these parameters is met. See [event batching][2] for more information.

| Max Events     | Max Bytes       | Timeout (seconds)   |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| None           | 10,000,000      | 1                   |
