<div class="alert alert-danger">For Worker versions 2.7 and later, the Google Cloud destination supports <a href = "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access">uniform bucket-level access</a>. Google <a href = "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access#should-you-use">recommends</a> using uniform bucket-level access. <br>For Worker version older than 2.7, only <a href = "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists">Access Control Lists</a> is supported.</div>

Use the Google Cloud Storage destination to send your logs to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. If you want to send logs to Google Cloud Storage for [archiving][1] and [rehydration][2], you must [configure Log Archives](#configure-log-archives). If you do not want to rehydrate logs in Datadog, skip to [Set up the destination for your pipeline](#set-up-the-destinations).

The Observability Pipelines Worker uses standard Google authentication methods. See [Authentication methods at Google][6] for more information about choosing the authentication method for your use case.

## Configure Log Archives

This step is only required if you want to send logs to Google Cloud Storage for [archiving][1] and [rehydration][2], and you don't already have a Datadog Log Archive configured for Observability Pipelines. If you already have a Datadog Log Archive configured or do not want to rehydrate your logs in Datadog, skip to [Set up the destination for your pipeline](#set-up-the-destinations).

If you already have a Datadog Log Archive configured for Observability Pipelines, skip to [Set up the destination for your pipeline](#set-up-the-destination-for-your-pipeline).

You need to have Datadog's [Google Cloud Platform integration][3] installed to set up Datadog Log Archives.

## Set up the destination for your pipeline {#set-up-the-destinations}

Set up the Google Cloud Storage destination and its environment variables when you [set up an Archive Logs pipeline][4]. The information below is configured in the pipelines UI.

{{% observability_pipelines/destination_settings/datadog_archives_google_cloud_storage %}}

### Set the environment variables

{{% observability_pipelines/destination_env_vars/datadog_archives_google_cloud_storage %}}

## How the destination works

### Event batching

A batch of events is flushed when one of these parameters is met. See [event batching][5] for more information.

| Max Events     | Max Bytes       | Timeout (seconds)   |
|----------------| ----------------| --------------------|
| None           | 100,000,000     | 900                 |
