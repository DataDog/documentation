Use the Amazon S3 destination to send logs to Amazon S3. If you want to send logs in Datadog-rehydratable format to Amazon S3 for [archiving][1] and [rehydration][2], you must [configure Log Archives](#configure-log-archives). If you want to send your logs directly to Amazon S3, without converting them to Datadog-rehydratable format, skip to [Set up the destination for your pipeline](#set-up-the-destination-for-your-pipeline).

You can also [route logs to Snowflake using the Amazon S3 destination](#route-logs-to-snowflake-using-the-amazon-s3-destination).

## Configure Log Archives

This step is only required if you want to send logs to Amazon S3 in Datadog-rehydratable format for [archiving][1] and [rehydration][2] and you don't already have a Datadog Log Archive configured for Observability Pipelines. If you already have a Datadog Log Archive configured or just want to send your logs directly to Amazon S3, skip to [Set up the destination for your pipeline](#set-up-the-destination-for-your-pipeline).

You need to have Datadog's [AWS integration][3] installed to set up Datadog Log Archives.

## Set up the destination for your pipeline

Set up the Amazon S3 destination and its environment variables when you [set up an Archive Logs pipeline][4]. The information below is configured in the pipelines UI.

## Route logs to Snowflake using the Amazon S3 destination

You can route logs from Observability Pipelines to Snowflake using the Amazon S3 destination by configuring Snowpipe in Snowflake to automatically ingest those logs. To set this up:
1. Configure [Log Archives](#configure-log-archives) if you want to [archive][1] and [rehydrate][2] your logs. If you only want to send logs to Amazon S3, skip to step 2.
1. [Set up a pipeline][5] to use Amazon S3 as the log destination. When logs are collected by Observability Pipelines, they are written to an S3 bucket using the same configuration detailed in [Set up the destination for your pipeline](#set-up-the-destination-for-your-pipeline), which includes AWS authentication, region settings, and permissions.
1. Set up Snowpipe in Snowflake. See [Automating Snowpipe for Amazon S3][6] for instructions. Snowpipe continuously monitors your S3 bucket for new files and automatically ingests them into your Snowflake tables, ensuring near real-time data availability for analytics or further processing.

### Event batching

A batch of events is flushed when one of these parameters is met. See [event batching][7] for more information.
