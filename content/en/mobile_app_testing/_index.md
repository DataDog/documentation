Mobile Application Testing allows you to test and monitor key business flows for Android and iOS applications using real devices. Datadog runs these tests on real devices to provide a realistic, step-by-step representation of key application workflows, screenshots of each step, and detailed pass or fail results so your team can quickly visualize what went wrong.

## Record mobile app tests

[Record mobile app tests][1] for Android and iOS using the no-code test recorder, which makes it easy to create robust and comprehensive tests.

## Run tests on CI or manually run tests

[Trigger mobile app tests][2] from your CI pipeline using [Continuous Testing][3], or [schedule mobile app tests][4] to run at regular intervals and manually trigger mobile app tests on the Datadog site.

## Use the Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing Explorer

Create [search queries and visualizations][5] for your Synthetic test runs or batches of tests running in CI/CD pipelines in the [Synthetic Monitoring & Continuous Testing Explorer][6].
