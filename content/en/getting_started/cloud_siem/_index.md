## Overview

[Datadog Cloud SIEM][1] detects real-time threats to your application and infrastructure. These threats can include a targeted attack, a threat intel listed IP communicating with your systems, or an insecure configuration. Once detected, a signal is generated and a notification can be sent out to your team.

This guide walks you through best practices for getting started with Cloud SIEM.

## Phase 1: Setup

1. Configure [log ingestion][2] to collect logs from your sources. Review [Best Practices for Log Management][3].

    You can use [out-of-the-box integration pipelines][4] to collect logs for more than {{< translate key="integration_count" >}} integrations, or [create custom log pipelines][5] to send:

    - [Cloud Audit logs][6]
    - [Identity Provider logs][7]
    - SaaS and Workspace logs
    - Third-party security integrations (for example, AWS GuardDuty)

2. Enable [Cloud SIEM][8].

## Phase 2: Signal exploration

1. Review the [out-of-the-box detection rules][9] that begin detecting threats in your environment immediately. Detection rules apply to all processed logs to maximize detection coverage. See the [detection rules][10] documentation for more information.

2. Explore [security signals][11]. When a threat is detected with a detection rule, a security signal is generated. See the [security signals][12] documentation for more information.

    - [Set up notification rules][13] to alert when signals are generated. You can alert using Slack, Jira, email, or webhooks. See the [notification rules][14] documentation for more information.

## Phase 3: Investigation

1. Explore the [Investigator][15] for faster remediation. See the [Investigator][16] documentation for more information.
2. Use [out-of-the-box-dashboards][17] or [create your own dashboards][18] for investigations, reporting, and monitoring.

## Phase 4: Customization

1. Set up [suppression rules][19] to reduce noise. 
2. Create [custom detection rules][20]. Review [Best Practices for Creating Detection Rules][21].
