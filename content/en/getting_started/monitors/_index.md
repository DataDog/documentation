## Overview

A [metric monitor][1] provides alerts and notifications if a specific metric is above or below a certain threshold. This page provides instructions for setting up a metric monitor to alert on low disk space.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need a [Datadog account][2] linked to a host with the [Datadog Agent][3] installed. To verify, check your [Infrastructure List][4] in Datadog.

## Setup

To create a [metric monitor][5] in Datadog, use the main navigation: *Monitors --> New Monitor --> Metric*.

### Choose the detection method

When you create a metric monitor, **Threshold Alert** is automatically selected as the detection method. A threshold alert compares metric values against user-defined thresholds. The goal for this monitor is to alert on a static threshold, so no change is necessary.

### Define the metric

To get an alert on low disk space, use the `system.disk.in_use` metric from the [Disk integration][6] and average the metric over `host` and `device`:

After this is set, the monitor automatically updates to a `Multi Alert` that triggers a separate alert for each `host`, `device` reporting your metric.

### Set alert conditions

According to the [Disk integration documentation][6], `system.disk.in_use` is *the amount of disk space in use as a fraction of the total*. So, when this metric is reporting a value of `0.7`, the device is 70% full.

To alert on low disk space, the monitor should trigger when the metric is `above` the threshold. The threshold values are based on your preference. For this metric, values between `0` and `1` are appropriate:

{{< img src="getting_started/application/monitor_configuration.png" alt="Metric monitor configuration settings within the Create Monitor page, with Multi Alert selected and configured to alert on the average of the query over the last 5 minutes for each host and device reporting the metric. The Set alert conditions section is configured to trigger when the evaluated value is above the threshold for any host or device, with the Alert threshold set at 0.9, the Warning threshold set at 0.8, and the monitor configured not to notify if data is missing" >}}

For this example, the other settings in this section are left on the defaults. For more details, see the [Metric Monitors][7] documentation.

### Say what's happening

Before a monitor can be saved, it must have a title and message.

#### Title

The title must be unique for each monitor. Since this is a multi alert monitor, names are available for each group element (`host` and `device`) with message template variables:
```text
Disk space is low on {{device.name}} / {{host.name}}
```

#### Message

Use the message to tell your team how to resolve the issue, for example:
```text
Steps to free up disk space:
1. Remove unused packages
2. Clear APT cache
3. Uninstall unnecessary applications
4. Remove duplicate files
```

For different messages based on alert vs. warning thresholds, see the [Notification][8] documentation.

### Notify your team

Use this section to send notifications to your team through Email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc. You can search for team members and connected accounts with the dropdown box. When an `@notification` is added to this box, the notification is automatically added to the message box:

{{< img src="getting_started/application/message_notify.png" alt="Message and Notifications" style="width:70%;" >}}

Removing the `@notification` from either section removes it from both sections.

### Permissions

{{< img src="getting_started/monitors/monitor_rbac_restricted.jpg" alt="RBAC Restricted Monitor" style="width:90%;" >}}

Use this option to restrict the editing of your monitor to its creator and to specific roles in your org. For more information about roles, see [Role Based Access Control][9].

## View Monitors and Triage Alerts on Mobile

You can view Monitor Saved Views from your mobile home screen or view and mute monitors by downloading the [Datadog Mobile App][10], available on the [Apple App Store][11] and [Google Play Store][12]. This helps with triaging when you are away from your laptop or desktop.
