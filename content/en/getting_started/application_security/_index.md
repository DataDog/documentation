## Overview

Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) helps secure your web applications and APIs in production. ASM provides visibility into application-level vulnerabilities in your services, and protects in real-time from attacks and attackers that aim to exploit these vulnerabilities.

This guide walks you through best practices for getting your team up and running with ASM.

## Identify services that have security risk


**Identify services vulnerable or exposed to attacks** that would benefit from ASM. Navigate to the [ASM Setup page][1] and select the services recommended there.

{{< img src="getting_started/appsec/ASM_activation_service_selection_v2.png" alt="ASM Services page view, showing Vulnerabilities and sorted by Suspicious requests column." style="width:100%;" >}}

These security insights are detected from data reported by APM. The insights help prioritize your security efforts. ASM identifies, prioritizes, and helps remediate all security risks on your services.

**Note**: If no vulnerabilities or suspicious requests are reported, ensure your services are using a recent Datadog tracing library version. From the [APM Service Catalog][2], open any service's side panel and look at its **Tracing Configuration**.

## Enable ASM

### Enable ASM with in-app instructions

Go to the [ASM Setup page][1] and follow the instructions to get started. This includes:
- Guided selection of services that would benefit from ASM.
- Configuring your Datadog tracing libraries with an environment variable.
- Restarting your services. </br>

1. [Go to ASM][18] and click **Get Started with ASM**.
2. Select services exposed to risk that are recommended by Datadog.
3. Follow the instructions to get started with ASM.

### Enable ASM with Remote Configuration
#### Prerequisites:
- Datadog Agent versions 7.42.0 or higher installed on your hosts or containers.
- Datadog Tracer versions are [compatible with Remote Configuration][16].

#### Setup Remote Configuration (if not enabled already)
  Follow the steps to enable [Remote Configuration][17] in your Datadog UI. This includes:
  1. Activate Remote Config capability for your organization.
  2. Add Remote Configuration capability to an existing API key, or create a new one.
  3. Update your Datadog Agent configuration to use the API key with Remote Configuration capability.

  See [Setting up Remote Configuration][21] for more information.

### Test ASM
Once enabled, ASM immediately identifies application vulnerabilities and detects attacks and attackers targeting your services.

1. **Validate vulnerabilities**: Navigate to the [Vulnerabilities tab][14], triage and remediate your vulnerabilities.
2. **Validate attacks**: Send attack patterns to trigger a test detection rule. From your terminal, run the following script:

  {{< code-block lang="sh" >}}
  for ((i=1;i<=250;i++)); do
  # Target existing service's routes
  curl https://your-application-url/<EXISTING ROUTE> -A
  'dd-test-scanner-log';
  # Target non existing service's routes
  curl https://your-application-url/<NON-EXISTING ROUTE> -A
  'dd-test-scanner-log';
  done{{< /code-block >}}

3. Go to [Security Signals Explorer][6] to see the signal that is generated after a few seconds.

## Reports and notifications

1. Set up [notification rules][23] to receive alerts using Slack, Jira, email, and more.
3. Subscribe to the weekly [threat digest][22] reports to begin investigation and remediation of the most important security threats discovered in the last seven days.
