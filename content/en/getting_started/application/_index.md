This page gives a high level overview of Datadog's capabilities.

## Integrations

{{< img src="getting_started/integrations.png" alt="integrations" responsive="true" >}}

* Datadog has over 350 integrations [officially listed][3].
* Custom integrations are available [via the Datadog API][4].
* The Agent is [open source][5].
* Once integrations have been configured, all data is treated the same throughout Datadog, whether it is living in a datacenter or in an online service.

## Infrastructure

{{< img src="getting_started/infrastructure.png" alt="infrastructure" responsive="true" >}}

* All machines show up in the [infrastructure list][6].
* You can see the tags applied to each machine. Tagging allows you to indicate which machines have a particular purpose.
* Datadog attempts to automatically categorize your servers. If a new machine is tagged, you can immediately see the stats for that machine based on what was previously set up for that tag. [Read more on tagging][7].

## Host Map

{{< img src="getting_started/hostmap-overview.png" alt="hostmap overview" responsive="true" >}}

[The Host Map][8] can be found under the Infrastructure menu. It offers the ability to:

* Quickly visualize your environment
* Identify outliers
* Detect usage patterns
* Optimize resources

To learn more about the Host Map, visit the [Host Map dedicated documentation page][8].

## Events

{{< img src="getting_started/event_stream.png" alt="Event stream" responsive="true" >}}

[The Event Stream][9] is based on the same conventions as a blog:

* Any event in the stream can be commented on.
* Can be used for distributed [teams][10] and maintaining the focus of an investigation.
* You can [filter][11] by `user`, `source`, `tag`, `host`, `status`, `priority`, and `incident`.

For each incident, users can:

* Increase/decrease priority
* Comment
* See similar incidents
* [@ notify team members][12], who receive an email
* `@support-datadog` to ask for [assistance][13]

## Dashboards

{{< img src="getting_started/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" responsive="true" >}}

Dashboards contain [graphs][14] with real-time performance metrics.

* Synchronous mousing across all graphs in a [screenboard][15].
* Vertical bars are events. They put a metric into context.
* Click and drag on a graph to zoom in on a particular timeframe.
* As you hover over the graph, the event stream moves with you.
* Display by zone, host, or total usage.
* Datadog exposes a JSON editor for the graph, allowing for [arithmetic][16] and [functions][17] to be applied to metrics.
* Share a graph snapshot that appears in the stream.
* Graphs can be embedded in an iframe. This enables you to give a 3rd party access to a live graph without also giving access to your data or any other information.

## Monitoring

{{< img src="getting_started/monitor.png" alt="monitor" responsive="true" >}}

[Monitoring][18] gives you the ability to be notified if the aggregate of a specific metric is above or below a certain thresholdâ€”across your entire infrastructure, or per machine (average, max, min, or sum).

* Applies to any metric, e.g., revenue, data center temperature, etc.
* Multi alerts (by device, host, etc.)
* Set alert notification message, including @ capabilities
