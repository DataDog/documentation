## Overview

[Datadog Cloud Security Management][1] (CSM) delivers real-time threat detection and continuous configuration audits across your entire cloud infrastructure. Powered by observability data, CSM includes [Misconfigurations][2] and [Threats][3].

This guide walks you through best practices for getting your team up and running with CSM.

## Phase 1: Deployment

1. Install the [Datadog Agent (version 7.46 or above)][4].
2. [Enable CSM for for your cloud resources and infrastructure][5]:
    - **CSM Threats**: Kubernetes, Docker, and host-based installations.
    - **CSM Misconfigurations**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and Docker instructions.
    - **CSM Identity Risks**: Enable AWS resource collection and Cloudtrail logs forwarding.
    - **CSM Vulnerabilities**: Container image scanning and host scanning instructions for Kubernetes, ECS EC2 instances, and host-based installations.
3. Check out the [CSM homepage][13] to get an overview of your organization's risks and threats.
4. Review [500+ out-of-the-box Threats and Misconfigurations detection rules][14].
5. Explore [security signals][15] and review [CSM Misconfigurations findings][16].
6. Review and remediate [identity risks][28] on the [Identity Risks][29] page.
7. Review container vulnerabilities on the [Container Images][25] page, and a consolidated list of vulnerabilities on the [Infrastructure Vulnerability][30] page.
8. Set up [notification rules][17] and receive alerts using Slack, Jira, email, and more.

## Phase 2: Customization

1. Set up [CSM Threats suppression rules][18] to reduce noise.
2. Create custom detection rules for [CSM Misconfigurations][19] and [CSM Threats][20].

## Phase 3: Reports and dashboards

1. Assess your organization's posture by reviewing [compliance reports][21].
2. Use out-of-the-box dashboards or [create your own][22] for faster investigations, reporting, and monitoring.
3. Subscribe to the weekly [security digest][31] reports to begin investigation and remediation of the most important new security issues discovered in the last seven days.
