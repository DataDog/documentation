## Overview

Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM or tracing) is used to collect [traces][1] from your backend application code. This beginners' guide shows you how get your first trace into Datadog.

**Note**: Datadog APM is available for many languages and frameworks. See the documentation on [Instrumenting Your Application][2]

## Datadog account

If you haven't already, create a [Datadog account][3].

## Datadog Agent

Before installing the Datadog Agent, set up a [Vagrant Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine][4] using the following commands. For more information about Vagrant, see their [Getting Started][5] page.

```text
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

To install the Datadog Agent on a host, use the [one line install command][6] updated with your [Datadog API key][7]:

{{< site-region region="us" >}}

```shell
DD_API_KEY=<DATADOG_API_KEY>  bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

{{< /site-region >}}

{{< site-region region="eu" >}}

```shell
DD_API_KEY=<DATADOG_API_KEY> DD_SITE="datadoghq.eu" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

{{< /site-region >}}

{{< site-region region="gov" >}}

```shell
DD_API_KEY=<DATADOG_API_KEY> DD_SITE="ddog-gov.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

{{< /site-region >}}

{{< site-region region="us3" >}}

```shell
DD_API_KEY=<DATADOG_API_KEY> DD_SITE="us3.datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

{{< /site-region >}}

### Validation

Verify the Agent is running with the [status command][8]:

```shell
sudo datadog-agent status
```

After a few minutes, verify the Agent is connected to your account by checking the [Infrastructure List][9] in Datadog.

## Datadog APM

### Follow the in-app documentation (recommended)

For the remaining steps, follow the [Quickstart instructions][10] within the Datadog app for the best experience, including:

- Step-by-step instructions scoped to your deployment configuration (in this case, a host-based deployment).
- Dynamically set `service`, `env`, and `version` tags.
- Enable the Continuous Profiler, ingesting 100% of traces, and Trace ID injection into logs during setup.


### Enable APM

For the latest versions of Agent v6 and v7, APM is enabled by default. You can see this in the Agent [`datadog.yaml` configuration file][11]:

```yaml
# apm_config:
##   Whether or not the APM Agent should run
#   enabled: true
```

And in `trace-agent.log`:

```shell
# /var/log/datadog/trace-agent.log:
2019-03-25 20:33:18 INFO (run.go:136) - trace-agent running on host ubuntu-xenial
2019-03-25 20:33:18 INFO (api.go:144) - listening for traces at http://localhost:8126
2019-03-25 20:33:28 INFO (api.go:341) - no data received
2019-03-25 20:34:18 INFO (service.go:63) - total number of tracked services: 0
```

### Environment name

For the best experience, it is recommended to use the the environment variable `DD_ENV` to configure `env` through your service's tracer.

Additionally, if your tracer has logs injection enabled then the `env` will be consistent across traces and logs.
Read more about how this works in [Unified Service Tagging][12].

Alternatively, name your environment by updating `datadog.yaml` to set `env` under `apm_config`. To learn more about setting `env` for APM, see the [setting primary tags to scope guide][13].

## APM application

### Installation

Before setting up the application, install `pip` then `flask` and `ddtrace` on your Ubuntu VM:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install flask
pip install ddtrace
```

### Create

On the Ubuntu VM, create the application `hello.py` with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'hello world'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5050)
```

### Run

Run `hello.py` with `ddtrace` which automatically instruments your application in Datadog:

```shell
export DD_SERVICE=hello
ddtrace-run python hello.py
```

You should see a similar output to:

```shell
* Serving Flask app "hello" (lazy loading)
  ...
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Test

Test your application and send your traces to Datadog using `curl`. Your application should be running (as shown above). In a separate command prompt run:

```text
vagrant ssh
curl http://0.0.0.0:5050/
```

This outputs:

```text
hello world
```

After a few minutes, your trace displays in Datadog under the `hello` service. Check the [services page][14] or [trace list][15].
