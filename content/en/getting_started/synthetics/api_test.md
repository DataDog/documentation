## Create an API test

[API tests][1] **monitor your API endpoints** and **alert you** when they become too slow or fail. These tests verify that your applications are responding to requests and meeting any conditions you define, such as **response time**, **HTTP status code**, and **header or body contents**.

The example below demonstrates the creation of an API test to ensure that your website is up and is providing responses in a given period of time.

### Configure the request

1. In the Datadog application, hover over **[UX Monitoring][2]** in the left hand menu and select **Synthetic Test**.
2. In the top right corner, click the **New Test** button.
3. Select **API test**.
4. Define your API request:

    - Add the URL of the endpoint you want to monitor. If you donâ€™t know what to start with, you can use `https://www.shopist.io/`, a test web application.
    - You can select **Advanced Options** to use custom request headers, authentication credentials, body content, or cookies.
    - You can set environment tags such as `env:prod` and `app:shopist` and additional tags on your test. Tags allow you to stay organized and quickly find test you're interested in on the homepage.
    - Click **Test URL**.

#### Define assertions

Datadog automatically populates basic assertions about your endpoint's response. Assertions define the alert condition and are customizable. 

In this example, three default assertions populate after the URL is tested:

To add a custom assertion, click anywhere in the response preview or click **New Assertion**.

#### Select locations 

Select one or more **Managed Locations** or **Private Locations** to run your test from.

Your managed locations often include public-facing websites and endpoints. To test internal applications or simulate user behavior in discrete geographic regions, select **Private Locations** instead.

For more information, see the [Private Locations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/synthetics/private_location) documentation.

#### Specify test frequency

Select the frequency of your test runs.

#### Define alert conditions

You can specify the number of failures per location before the location is considered failed:

```text
Retry x time before location is marked as failed
```

After a location fails, retries immediately run.

**Note**: By default, the wait time for a failed test to retry is 300ms. You can configure the interval with the [Synthetics API][3].

To receive alerts when your endpoint goes down for three minutes on two different locations, set up an alerting condition such as:

```text
An alert is triggered if your test fails for 3 minutes from any 2 of 13 locations
```

#### Notify your team

Add an alert name to the **Monitor Name** field and write a message for the alert. You can tag other teams, specify which service and team members receive the alert notifications, and use [integrations][4] such as Slack, PagerDuty, and webhooks.

You can set time for your alert notification to re-notify if the alert has not been resolved and define the priority of the alert, ranging from **P5 (Info)** to **P1 (Critical)**.

When you're ready to run your test, click **Save Test**. 

### Test results

The API test details page displays an overview of the test configuration, the global uptime associated with the tested endpoint by location, graphs about response time and network timings, and a list of test results and events.

To troubleshoot a failed test, scroll down to **Test Results** and click on a failing test result. Review failed assertions and response details such as status code, response time, and associated headers and body to diagnose the issue.

With Datadog's [APM integration with Synthetic Monitoring][5], you can access the root cause of a failed test run with a trace generated from the test run.
