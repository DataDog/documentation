## Overview

Synthetic tests allow you to observe how your systems and applications are performing using **simulated requests and actions from around the globe**. Datadog tracks the performance of your webpages and APIs from the backend to the frontend, and at various network levels (`HTTP`, `SSL`, `DNS`, `WebSocket`, `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, and `gRPC`) in a controlled and stable way, alerting you about faulty behavior such as regressions, broken features, high response times, and unexpected status codes.

## Synthetic test types

Datadog offers **API tests**, **Multistep API tests**, and **Browser tests**.

To monitor internal-facing applications, run your tests from managed locations or private locations. Synthetic tests can be triggered manually, on a schedule, or directly from your CI/CD pipelines.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already, create a [Datadog account][1].

## Configure your first test

To set up your first Synthetic test with Datadog, choose from the following options:

- [Create an API test][2] to start monitoring your API endpoints' uptime.
- [Create a multistep API test][3] to link several HTTP requests and start monitoring key workflows at the API level.
- [Create a browser test][4] to start testing critical business transactions on your applications.
- [Create a private location][5] to start monitoring internal applications using all Synthetic test types.
