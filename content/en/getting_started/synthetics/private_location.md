## Overview

Private locations allow you to **monitor internal-facing applications** or private URLs that arenâ€™t accessible from the public internet. 

You can also use private locations to:

- **Create custom locations** in mission-critical areas of your business.
- **Verify the application performance in your internal testing environment** before you release new features to production with [Synthetic CI/CD Testing][1].
- **Compare the application performance** from inside and outside your internal network.

Private locations are Docker containers that you can install anywhere inside your private network. You can access the [private location worker image][2] on Docker Hub.

Once you've created and installed your private location, you can assign [Synthetic tests][3] to your private location just like you would with a managed location. Your private locations test results display identically to your managed location test results.

## Create your private location

1. Install [Docker][4] on a machine. To get started quickly, you can install Docker on a virtual machine such as [Vagrant Ubuntu 16.04][2].
2. In the Datadog application, hover over **[UX Monitoring][5]** and select **Settings** > **Private Locations**. 
3. Click **Add Private Location**.
4. Fill out your private location details (only `Name` and `API key` fields are mandatory). Depending on where you installed your private location (such as behind a proxy), you may need to configure additional parameters. For more information, see [Private Locations Configuration Options][8]. 
5. Click **Save Location and Generate Configuration File** to generate the configuration file associated with your private location on your worker.
6. Copy and paste your private location configuration file to your working directory.

    **Note**: The configuration file contains secrets for private location authentication, test configuration decryption, and test result encryption. Datadog does not store the secrets, so store them locally before leaving the **Private Locations** page. **You need to be able to reference the secrets again in order to add more workers to your private location**. 
    
7. Launch your worker as a standalone container using the Docker `run` command and the previously created configuration file:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -v $PWD/worker-config-<LOCATION_ID>.json:/etc/datadog/synthetics-check-runner.json datadog/synthetics-private-location-worker
    ```

8. If your private location reports correctly to Datadog, you will see an `OK` health status on your **Private Locations** list in **Settings**:

    {{< img src="synthetics/private_locations/pl_health.png" alt="Private Location Health"  style="width:100%;">}}

    You should also receive private location logs on your terminal:

    ```text
    2019-12-17 13:05:03 [info]: Fetching 10 messages from queue - 10 slots available
    2019-12-17 13:05:03 [info]: Fetching 10 messages from queue - 10 slots available
    2019-12-17 13:05:04 [info]: Fetching 10 messages from queue - 10 slots available
    ```

You are now able to use your new private location just like a managed location to run Synthetic tests.

## Run synthetic tests with your private location

1. Create an [API test][2], [multistep API test][9], or [browser test][10] on any internal endpoint or application you want to monitor.
2. Under **Private Locations**, select your new private location:

    {{< img src="synthetics/private_locations/assign_test_pl.png" alt="Assign Synthetic test to private location"  style="width:75%;">}}

3. Continue filling out your test!
