title: Datadog Sites
kind: documentation

Datadog offers different sites throughout the world. Each site is completely independent, and you cannot share data across sites. Each site gives you benefits (for example, government security regulations) or allows you to store your data in specific locations around the world.

| Site    | Site URL                   | Location |
|---------|----------------------------|----------|
| US1     | `https://app.datadoghq.com`| US       |
| US3     | `https://us3.datadoghq.com`| US       |
| EU1     | `https://app.datadoghq.eu` | EU       |
| US1-FED | `https://app.ddog-gov.com` | US       |

## How do I tell which Datadog site I am on?

You can identify which site you are on by matching your Datadog application URL to the site URL in the table above.

Since the Datadog sites may support different Datadog functionalities depending on that instance's security requirements, this documentation website allows you to select which site you need information for by using the dropdown site selector that is on the right side of all of the documentation pages.
