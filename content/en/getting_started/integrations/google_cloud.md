## Overview

Use this guide to get started with monitoring your Google Cloud environment. This approach simplifies the setup for Google Cloud environments with multiple projects, allowing you to maximize your monitoring coverage.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1) Create a [Datadog account][1]
2) Set up a [Service Account][2] in any of your Google Cloud projects
3) Review these Google Cloud Prerequisites:

{{% site-region region="us,us3,us5,eu,ap1,ap2" %}}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● If your organization restricts identities by domain, you must add Datadog's customer identity `C0147pk0i` as an allowed value in your policy.
{{% /site-region %}}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● The Google Cloud integration requires the below APIs to be enabled **for each of the projects** you want to monitor:

<div class="alert alert-danger">Ensure that any projects being monitored are not configured as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/settings#:~:text=A%20scoping%20project%20hosts%20a,is%20also%20a%20scoping%20project.">scoping projects</a> that pull in metrics from multiple other projects.</div>

[Cloud Monitoring API][3] 
: Allows Datadog to query your Google Cloud metric data.

[Compute Engine API][4] 
: Allows Datadog to discover compute instance data.

[Cloud Asset API][5]
: Allows Datadog to request Google Cloud resources and link relevant labels to metrics as tags.

[Cloud Resource Manager API][6] 
: Allows Datadog to append metrics with the correct resources and tags.

[IAM API][7]
: Allows Datadog to authenticate with Google Cloud.

[Cloud Billing API][8] 
: Allows developers to manage billing for their Google Cloud Platform projects programmatically. See the [Cloud Cost Management (CCM)](#cloud-cost-management-ccm) section for more information.

<div class="alert alert-info">You can confirm if these APIs are enabled by going to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard">Enabled APIs & Services</a>.</div>

### Metric collection

### Limit metric collection filters

You can choose which services and resources to collect metrics from. This can help control costs by reducing the number of API calls made on your behalf.

{{% collapse-content title="Limit metric collection by Google Cloud service" level="h4" %}}
Under the **Metric Collection** tab in Datadog's [Google Cloud integration page][11], deselect the metric namespaces to exclude.

{{< img src="integrations/google_cloud_platform/limit_metric_namespaces.png" alt="The metric collection tab in the Datadog Google Cloud integration page" style="width:80%;">}}
{{% /collapse-content %}} 

{{% collapse-content title="Limit metric collection by host or Cloud Run instance" level="h4" %}}
1. Assign a tag (such as `datadog:true`) to the hosts or Cloud Run instances you want to monitor with Datadog.
2. Under the **Metric Collection** tab in Datadog's [Google Cloud integration page][11], enter the tags in the **Limit Metric Collection Filters** textbox. Only hosts that match one of the defined tags are imported into Datadog. You can use wildcards (`?` for single character, `*` for multi-character) to match many hosts, or `!` to exclude certain hosts. This example includes all `c1*` sized instances, but excludes staging hosts:

```text
datadog:monitored,env:production,!env:staging,instance-type:c1.*
```

See Google's documentation on [Creating and managing labels][44] for more details.
{{% /collapse-content %}} 

In the below example, only Google Cloud hosts with the label `datadog:true` are monitored by Datadog: 

{{< img src="integrations/google_cloud_platform/limit_metric_collection.png" alt="The fields to limit metric collection in the Google Cloud integration tile" style="width:100%;" >}}

#### Best practices for monitoring multiple projects

##### Enable per-project cost and API quota attribution

By default, Google Cloud attributes the cost of monitoring API calls, as well as API quota usage, to the project containing the service account for this integration. As a best practice for Google Cloud environments with multiple projects, enable per-project cost attribution of monitoring API calls and API quota usage. With this enabled, costs and quota usage are attributed to the project being *queried*, rather than the project containing the service account. This provides visibility into the monitoring costs incurred by each project, and also helps to prevent reaching API rate limits.

To enable this feature:
1. Ensure that the Datadog service account has the [Service Usage Consumer][410] role at the desired scope (folder or organization).
2. Click the **Enable Per Project Quota** toggle in the **Projects** tab of the [Google Cloud integration page][411].

[410]: https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/access-control#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer
[411]: https://app.datadoghq.com/integrations/google-cloud-platform/

## Log collection

Forwarding logs from your Google Cloud environment enables near real-time monitoring of the resources and activities taking place in your organization or folder. You can set up [log monitors][37] to be notified of issues, use [Cloud SIEM][38] to detect threats, or leverage [Watchdog][39] to identify unknown issues or anomalous behavior.

Use the [Datadog Dataflow template][14] to batch and compresses your log events before forwarding them to Datadog through [Google Cloud Dataflow][15]. This is the most network-efficient way to forward your logs. To specify which logs are forwarded, configure the [Google Cloud Logging sink][40] with any inclusion or exclusion queries using Google Cloud's [Logging query language][56].

You can use the [terraform-gcp-datadog-integration][64] module to manage this infrastructure through Terraform, or follow [the instructions listed here][16] to set up Log Collection. You can also use the [Stream logs from Google Cloud to Datadog][9] guide in the Google Cloud architecture center, for a more detailed explanation of the steps and architecture involved in log forwarding. For a deep dive into the benefits of the Pub/Sub to Datadog template, read [Stream your Google Cloud logs to Datadog with Dataflow][17] in the Datadog blog.

<div class="alert alert-danger">The <b>Dataflow API</b> must be enabled to use Google Cloud Dataflow. See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis"><b>Enabling APIs</b></a> in the Google Cloud documentation for more information.</div>

## Leveraging the Datadog Agent

After the Google Cloud integration is configured, Datadog automatically starts collecting Google Cloud metrics. However, you can leverage the Datadog Agent to gather deeper insights into your infrastructure.

The [Datadog Agent][31] provides the [most granular, low-latency metrics][32] from your infrastructure, delivering real-time insights into CPU, memory, disk usage, and more for your Google Cloud hosts. 
The Agent can be installed on any host, including [GKE][33].

The Agent also supports a wide range of [integrations][34], enabling you to extend visibility into specific services and databases running on your hosts. 

[Traces][35] collected through the Agent enable comprehensive Application Performance Monitoring (APM), helping you understand end-to-end service performance.

[Logs][57] collected through the Agent provide visibility into your Google Cloud resources, and the activities taking place in your Google Cloud environment.

For the full list of benefits of installing the Agent on your cloud instances, see [Why should I install the Datadog Agent on my cloud instances?][36]

## Resource changes collection

Resource changes collection allows you to monitor infrastructure changes in your Google Cloud environment. When Google's Cloud Asset Inventory detects changes in your cloud resources, an event is forwarded to Datadog's [Event Management][62] through a Cloud Pub/Sub topic and subscription. Use these events to be proactively notified of risky changes in your infrastructure, and to assist with troubleshooting. 

For detailed setup instructions, see the [resource changes collection section][18] of the Google Cloud integration documentation.
