# Overview

Datadog Event Management Inbox helps correlate events from any source into actionable insights, enabling teams to track events generated by the Datadog Agent, integrations, third-party tools, change requests, deployments, and configuration changes. By consolidating these insights, teams can streamline incident response and improve operational efficiency.

Event Management provides a centralized inbox that helps teams efficiently triage, investigate, and resolve incidents. Users can quickly preview related events, identify root causes, and take appropriate actions. Filtering and sorting options allow teams to focus on the most critical cases, while collaboration features like tagging and case merging ensure seamless teamwork. By providing a structured workflow, Event Management enhances incident response and resolution, reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.

# Key Features

## Case Triage and Investigation

- **Inbox for Centralized Triage:** View and manage all incoming cases in a single location.  
- **Related Events and Metrics**: Gain insights into correlated logs, metrics, and alerts.  
- **Root Cause Identification:** Preview linked cases to diagnose incidents.  
- **Bulk Actions:** Apply updates to cases by modifying their priority, assigning them to team members, or escalating multiple cases at once. 

# Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Service Management** → **Event Management** → **Inbox**.  
2. Click **Show Control** to display current case statuses such as **Open**, **In Progress**, **Closed**, **Archived**. To minimize the left-hand case status panel, click **Collapse.**  
3. Choose between a **structured table layout** or a **split view** to see contextual details alongside case information.  
4. Use the **sort toggle** to organize your inbox to focus on high-urgency cases or specific statuses such as **P1/P2** **cases**, **Status**, **Created at**.  
5. Apply bulk actions to update multiple cases at once. You can change priority, assign cases, or escalate issues while triaging.   
6. Take action by claiming the case, merging similar cases, or splitting unrelated alerts to keep investigations organized.
7. Share the case with your team for collaboration and visibility.  
8. View related events and metrics relative to the current case.
9. Click to Declare an Incident, Create a Jira Issue or Create a Service Now Incident, or run a Workflow.
10. When the issue is resolved, the system automatically closes the case, or you can manually mark it as resolved.
  
With Datadog Event Management, teams can improve operations efficiency by reducing time spent on even correlations and triage, ensuring faster and more effective incident resolution.
