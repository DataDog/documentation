# Overview

Datadog Event Management Inbox helps correlate events from any source into actionable insights, enabling teams to track events generated by the Datadog Agent, integrations, third-party tools, change requests, deployments, and configuration changes. By consolidating these insights, teams can streamline incident response and improve operational efficiency.

Event Management provides a centralized inbox that helps teams efficiently triage, investigate, and resolve incidents. Users can quickly preview related events, identify root causes, and take appropriate actions. Filtering and sorting options allow teams to focus on the most critical cases, while collaboration features like tagging and case merging ensure seamless teamwork. By providing a structured workflow, Event Management enhances incident response and resolution, reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.
