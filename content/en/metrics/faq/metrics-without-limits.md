## What is Metrics without Limits\*?

Metrics without Limits\* provides you with the ability to customize tagging on all metric types in-app without having to redeploy or change any code. With Metrics without Limits\*, you’ll be able to customize tagging to drop in-app host-level tags attached to application-level or business metrics. This functionality will be located in the [Metrics Summary][1] page.

## Configuration of tags
Click on any metric name to open its details sidepanel. Then click on the **Manage Tags** button and then **“Custom”** to configure the tags you’d like remain as queryable on dashboards/monitors. Before hitting **Save**, you’ll see an estimated new volume of indexed custom metrics that results from this potential tag configuration.

## What is the pricing of Metrics without Limits\*?

Configuring your tags gives you control over what custom metrics can be queried -- ultimately reducing your billable count of custom metrics. Given this new functionality, your contract for custom metrics will include:
- **Ingested custom metrics**: custom metrics you send to Datadog in code
- **Indexed custom metrics** : remaining custom metrics available for query after you’ve configured tags in-app

Please reach out to your Customer Support Manager if you're interested in this private beta and for further pricing details of this feature.
