## Overview

{{< callout url="#" btn_hidden="true" header="Join the Preview!" >}}
  This feature is currently in Preview.
{{< /callout >}} 

Datadog’s Dynamic Metrics Quotas offers you greater control over your custom metrics cost through custom metrics quotas for accounts, teams, or metric names. You define a metric monitor on your [estimated usage metrics][10], and when triggered the monitor launches a workflow through [Workflow Automation][3]. 

The workflow sends a Slack message asking for permission to automatically apply [Metrics without Limits™][1] configurations to the triggering metrics, reducing the usage and cost of these metrics on your behalf. These configuration updates are generated by Datadog’s intelligent query insights, which uses a list of the actively queried tags to ensure that your cost-optimized configuration doesn’t sacrifice visibility.

See the [Best Practices Guide for Custom Metrics Governance][11] for more information about monitoring and prevention of overages and sudden spikes in your overall account’s custom metrics usage.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. A Datadog account with [Workflow Automation][3] enabled
2. The Datadog [Slack integration][5] installed

### Configure blueprint

#### How to build a per-metric quota

{{< img src="/metrics/guide/dynamic_quotas/automated_mwl_workflow_monitor.png" alt="The Make a decision tiles on the Datadog automated Metrics without Limits™ workflow blueprint" style="width:100%;" >}}

1. Open this [workflow blueprint][8], and click ***Create from Blueprint***.
2. Click on the green Monitor tile, and enable the ***Automatic triggering*** toggle. 
3. Copy the workflow's ***Mention handle*** for use in step 5 below.
3. Create a [metric monitor][9]. In the **Define the metric** step, select `datadog.estimated_usage.metrics.custom.by_metric` as your metric name and choose the `SUM BY` space aggregator. It's recommend to use the `Threshold Alert` monitor type, but you can also use Change or Anomaly Detection.
4. Under **Set alert conditions**, define your quota threshold.
5. Under **Configure notifications & automations**, update the monitor notification message and include the Workflow handle from step 2 above.
6. Select ***Multi Alert*** to send a notification for each metric triggering the monitor.
7. Click ***Create*** to create the metric monitor.
8. Click ***Save***.
9. Click ***Publish*** and ***Run*** to start automatically managing your custom metrics costs. 

#### Configure Slack notifications

The workflow blueprint contains several Slack integration tiles that need to be updated. Input the Slack channel or specific user(s) responsible for granting permission to Datadog to configure these metrics to reduce costs on your behalf.
