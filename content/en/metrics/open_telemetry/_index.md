## Overview

[OpenTelemetry][1] is an open source observability framework that provides IT teams with standardized protocols and tools for collecting and routing telemetry data. Created as an incubator project by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][2] (CNCF), OpenTelemetry provides a consistent format for instrumenting, generating, gathering, and exporting application telemetry data—namely metrics, logs, and traces—to monitoring platforms for analysis and insight.

## Setup

To send OpenTelemetry metrics to Datadog, you have three main options:

- [OpenTelemetry Collector][3]
- [Datadog Agent][4]
- [Agentless Deployment][5]

For more information about which setup is right for you, see [Send Data to Datadog][6].

## Query across Datadog and OpenTelemetry metrics 

Because OTel and Datadog metrics often use different naming conventions and semantic definitions, creating a unified view of your infrastructure in these environments can be challenging.

Datadog helps you bridge this gap by enabling you to:

- Query OTel and Datadog metrics together.
- Understand how OTel and Datadog metrics map to each other.

For more information, read [Query Across Datadog and OpenTelemetry Metrics][7].

## OTLP metric types

The Datadog Agent and the OpenTelemetry Collector Datadog exporter can ingest metrics in the OpenTelemetry format (OTLP), which can be produced by OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications. 

For more information, read [OTLP metric types][10].

## Out-of-the-box dashboards

Datadog provides out-of-the-box dashboards that you can copy and customize. To use Datadog's out-of-the-box OpenTelemetry dashboards, go to **Dashboards** > **Dashboards list** and search for `opentelemetry`:

{{< img src="metrics/otel/dashboard.png" alt="The Dashboards list, showing two OpenTelemetry out-of-the-box dashboards: Host Metrics and Collector Metrics." style="width:80%;">}}

The **Host Metrics** dashboard is for data collected from the [host metrics receiver][8]. The **Collector Metrics** dashboard is for any other types of metrics collected, depending on which [metrics receiver][9] you choose to enable.
