## Overview

The [Metrics Summary page][1] displays a list of your metrics reported to Datadog under a specified time frame: the past hour, day, or week. This list can be filtered by name. Click on a metric name to display a panel with more detailed information.

## Metric panel

The metric panel displays key information for a given metric.

### Metric name

The name of your metric in the [metric explorer][2], [dashboards][3], etc.
 
### Number of distinct metrics

A metric can correspond to multiple distinct metrics depending on its associated tags. Learn more in the [custom metrics][4] documentation.

### Hosts

The total number of hosts reporting a metric along with a list of hosts.

### Tags

The total number of tags attached to a metric along with a list of tags. Learn more in the [tagging][5] documentation.

### Metrics metadata

The metadata attached to your metric. Most of the metadata can be edited on the metric summary page or with the [Datadog API][6].

#### Metric description

The metric description helps you understand what a metric does. Descriptions are pre-populated for metrics coming from supported [integrations][7]. Use this field to update the descriptions for your [custom metrics][4].

#### Metric unit

The unit for your metric (byte, second, request, query, etc.). See the [metric unit][8] page for more details.

When submitting custom metrics to Datadog, it is possible to change the [unit of measurement][1] that displays when hovering over the metric in your graph. **Note**: This does not change how a metric graph is displayedâ€”it only changes the units of measurement that raw values are considered as, when hovering over a metric. Formatting is automatically applied for readability. For example, bytes (`B`) may be displayed as kibibytes (`KiB`).

#### Metric type

The type for your metric (gauge, rate, or count). See the [metric type][8] page for more details.

**Warning**: Editing the metric type changes that metric's behavior for **ALL** your analytics and monitors.

#### Integration name

If the metric is coming from a supported [integration][7], the metadata lists the integration name. This information cannot be edited.

#### Interval

The collection interval for the metric in seconds.
