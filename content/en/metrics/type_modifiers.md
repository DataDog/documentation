A metric type is an indication of what you are trying to represent with your metric and its emission source. If you refer to the [metric types][1] documentation, you can see that the `COUNT` and `RATE` metric types are quite similar to each other, as they represent the same concept: the variation of a metric value over time. However, they use different logic:

* `RATE`: Normalized value variation over time (_per second_).
* `COUNT`: Absolute value variation over a given time interval.

Depending on your use case and submission method, one metric type may be more suited than the other for submission. For instance:

| Metric type submitted | Use case                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RATE`                | You want to monitor the number of requests received over time across several hosts.                                                                                                    |
| `RATE`                | You do not have control over the consistency of temporal count submissions across your sources, so you're normalizing by each individual interval to be able to compare them upstream. |
| `COUNT`               | You want to count the number of times a function is called.                                                                                                                            |
| `COUNT`               | Counting the amount of revenue that have been made over a given amount of time.                                                                                                        |

Since `RATE` and `COUNT` aren't the same metric type, they don't have the same behavior or shape within Datadog graphs and monitors. To change metrics on the fly between `RATE` and `COUNT` representations, use Datadog's in-application modifier functions within your graphs and monitors.

## In-application modifiers

The two main in-application modifiers are `as_count()` and `as_rate()`.

| Modifiers    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `as_count()` | Sets the operations necessary to display the given metric in `COUNT` form, giving you the absolute variation of a metric value over [a rollup interval][2]. Note that since it depends on the rollup interval, [graphing a longer time interval changes your graph shape][3]. |
| `as_rate()`  | Sets the operations necessary to display the given metric in `RATE` form, giving you the absolute variation of a metric value per second.                                                                                                                                     |

Depending on the metric type you applied them to, the behavior differs:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "COUNT" %}}

* Effect of `as_count()`:
  * Disables any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to `SUM`.
* Effect of `as_rate()`:
  * Disables any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to `SUM`.
  * Divides the result post-aggregation by the sampling interval in order to normalize it. For example, the following points submitted every second `[1,1,1,1].as_rate()` with a rollup interval of 20s would produce `[0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]`.

**Note**: There is no normalization on very small intervals (when no time aggregation occurs), thus the raw metric value counts are returned.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "RATE" %}}

* Effect of `as_count()`:
  * Disable any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to SUM.
  * Multiply the result post-aggregation by the sampling interval. For example, the following points submitted every second `[0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05].as_count()` with a rollup interval of 20s would produce `[1,1,1,1]`.
* Effect of `as_rate()`:
  * Disables any [interpolation][1].
  * Sets the time aggregator to `SUM`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "GAUGE" %}}

`GAUGE` metric types represent the absolute and final value of a metric; `as_count()` and `as_rate()` modifiers have no effect on them.

## Modify a metric's type within Datadog

While it is not normally required, it is possible to change a metric's type in the [metric summary page][4]:

{{< img src="developers/metrics/type_modifiers/metric_type.png" alt="Metric Type"  style="width:70%;">}}

Example use case:

1. You have a metric `app.requests.served` that counts requests served, but accidentally submitted it via StatsD as a `GAUGE`. The metric's Datadog type is, therefore, `GAUGE`.

2. You wanted to submit `app.requests.served` as a StatsD `COUNT` metric for time aggregation. This would help answer questions like _"How many total requests were served in the past day?"_ by querying `sum:app.requests.served{*}` (this would not make sense for a `GAUGE` metric type.)

3. You like the name `app.requests.served`, so rather than submitting a new metric name with a more appropriate `COUNT` type, you could change the type of `app.requests.served` by updating:
  * Your submission code, calling `dogstatsd.increment('app.requests.served', N)` after N requests are served, and
  * The Datadog in-app type via the metric summary page to `RATE`.

This causes data submitted before the type change for `app.requests.served` to behave incorrectly because it was stored in a format to be interpreted as an in-app `GAUGE` (not a `RATE`). Data submitted after step 3 is interpreted properly.

If you are not willing to lose the historical data submitted as a `GAUGE`, create a new metric name with the new type, leaving the type of `app.requests.served` unchanged.

**Note**: For the AgentCheck, `self.increment` does not calculate the delta for a monotonically increasing counter; instead, it reports the value passed in at the check run. To send the delta value on a monotonically increasing counter, use `self.monotonic_count`.
