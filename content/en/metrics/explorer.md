## Overview

The [Metrics Explorer][1] is a basic interface for examining your metrics in Datadog. For more advanced options, create a [notebook][2] or dashboard ([screenboard][3], or [timeboard][4]).

## Graphing

Click on the **Graph** text box to see a list of metrics you have submitted to Datadog. Begin by typing in the text box to filter the metrics, then click a metric to select it. Each metric you select creates a real-time graph visualization on the right side of the page.

Above your graphs, you can specify the timeframe and graph size.

**Note**: The **Calculate as count where applicable** check box appears for metrics with the `RATE` type.

### Scope

Define a filtering scope with the **Over** text box by selecting or searching for tag values. For example, you can use the **Over** text box to filter metric values from a specific host, cluster, environment, region, etc.

### Grouping

Define the grouping with the **One graph per** text box by selecting or searching for tag keys. For example, you can split a single metric into multiple graphs by host, container, region, environment, etc. Metrics tagged with the `<KEY>:<VALUE>` format can be grouped.

### Space aggregation

Define the [space aggregation][5] used to combine a metric's values with the **On each graph, aggregate with the** text box. The possible options are:

* Average of reported values (default)
* Max of reported values
* Min of reported values
* Sum of reported values

**Note**: The options may differ based on the metric type selected.

### Options

You can update the following options for the metrics explorer:

* Prefix graph titles with `<VALUE>`: The default is blank.
* Show up to `<NUMBER>` graphs at a time: The default is 20.

### Export

Export all graphs to a new or existing timeboard with the buttons at the bottom left. Individual graphs can be exported by clicking the export icon on the top right of each graph.

### Snapshot

Create a snapshot of an individual graph by using the share icon in the upper right. Clicking on the icon displays a dropdown menu with the **Send snaphot...** option.
