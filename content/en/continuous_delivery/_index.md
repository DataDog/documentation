Datadog Continuous Delivery (CD) Visibility unifies information about CD providers in addition to data about CI pipelines. CD Visibility brings software delivery metrics and data into Datadog dashboards and notebooks so you can communicate the health of your CD provider and focus your efforts in improving your team's ability to deliver quality code every time.
