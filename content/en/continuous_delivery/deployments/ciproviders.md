## Overview

[Deployments][10] can be performed in your continuous integration (CI) pipelines. Typically, these pipelines have a deployment step that is executed after the source code is tested and the image is built.
If you are executing deployments using a CI provider, you can monitor your deployments with CD Visibility if the following requirements are met:

1. You are using [Pipeline Visibility][1] to monitor your CI pipelines.
2. Your CI provider supports the **Custom tags and metrics at runtime** feature. For more details, see the [supported features table][2].
3. You are executing deployments in a CI job (or [related level][9] in your CI provider).

## Setup

<div class="alert alert-info">
The setup requires the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datadog/datadog-ci"> <code>datadog-ci</code> CLI </a> version `2.26.0` or later.
</div>

To set up CD Visibility, use the `datadog-ci deployment mark` command inside the CI job that is performing the deployment.

Two environment variables are required:

1. `DD_API_KEY`: Point to your [Datadog API key][4].
2. `DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED`: Set to 1.

Optionally, you can point the `DD_SITE` environment variable to a specific [Datadog site][3] (the default value is `datadoghq.com`).

You can enrich the deployment event that is generated by the `datadog-ci deployment mark` command using the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `--env` | The environment to which this deployment is performed. For example, `prod`. |
| `--revision` | The revision or version that is being deployed. For example, `1.0.0` or `v123-456`. |
| `--is-rollback` | Specifies that the deployment is a rollback. |
| `--tags` | An array of key-value pairs in the `key:value` format. These tags are added to the deployment event shown in Datadog. |

Use `--no-fail` (default: `false`) to prevent the deployment command from failing if there are issues submitting the data.

Once you have added the command to a CI job, the [**Deployments** page][5] and the [Deployment Executions Explorer][6] populates with data after pipelines are executed.
For more information, see [Search and Manage Deployments][7] and the [CD Visibility Explorer documentation][8].

### Examples

This set of commands specifies that the CI job executes a deployment to the `prod` environment with version `1.0.0`:

```shell
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}

datadog-ci deployment mark --env prod --revision 1.0.0
```

This set of commands specifies that the CI job performs a rollback deployment to the `prod` environment:

```shell
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}

datadog-ci deployment mark --env prod --is-rollback
```

This set of commands specifies that the CI job executes a deployment to the `prod` environment and adds the `team:backend` and `reason:scheduled` tags to the deployment event:

```shell
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}

datadog-ci deployment mark --env prod --tags team:backend --tags reason:scheduled
```
