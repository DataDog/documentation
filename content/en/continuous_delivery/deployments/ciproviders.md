## Overview

[Deployments][10] can be performed in your continuous integration (CI) pipelines. Typically, these pipelines have a deployment step that is executed after the source code is tested and the image is built.

If you are executing deployments using a CI provider, you can monitor your deployments with Deployment Visibility. Ensure the following requirements are met:

1. You are using [Pipeline Visibility][1] to monitor your CI pipelines.
2. Your CI provider supports the **Custom tags and metrics at runtime** feature, which allows you to add [user-defined text and numerical tags][2] to pipelines and jobs in Pipeline Visibility. 
3. You are executing deployments in a CI job (or a [related level][9] in your CI provider). The concept of a CI job may vary depending on your provider. For more information about how Datadog defines a CI job, see the [Terminology section][9].

## Setup

<div class="alert alert-info">
The setup requires the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datadog/datadog-ci"> <code>datadog-ci</code> CLI </a> version `2.26.0` or later.
</div>

To set up CD Visibility, use the `datadog-ci deployment mark` command inside the CI job that is performing the deployment.

Two environment variables are required:

1. `DD_API_KEY`: Point to your [Datadog API key][4].
2. `DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED`: Set to 1.

Optionally, you can set `DD_SITE` environment variable to a specific [Datadog site][3]. Your site is {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}.

You can enrich the deployment event that is generated by the `datadog-ci deployment mark` command using the following parameters:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--env`         | The environment to which this deployment is performed. For example, `prod`.                                                             |
| `--service`     | The name of the service being deployed. For example, `transaction-service`. This option requires `datadog-ci` version `2.31.1` or later |
| `--revision`    | The revision or version that is being deployed. For example, `1.0.0` or `v123-456`.                                                     |
| `--is-rollback` | Specifies that the deployment is a rollback.                                                                                            |
| `--tags`        | An array of key-value pairs in the `key:value` format. These tags are added to the deployment event shown in Datadog.                   |

Use `--no-fail` (default: `false`) to prevent the deployment command from failing if there are issues submitting the data.

If you are using GitHub Actions as your CI provider, see the [section below][11] for additional considerations.

Once you have added the command to a CI job, the [**Deployments** page][5] and the [Deployment Executions Explorer][6] populates with data after pipelines are executed.
For more information, see [Search and Manage Deployments][7] and the [CD Visibility Explorer documentation][8].

### Examples

This set of commands specifies that the CI job executes a deployment to the `prod` environment with version `1.0.0`:

```shell
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}

datadog-ci deployment mark --env prod --revision 1.0.0
```

This set of commands specifies that the CI job performs a rollback deployment to the `prod` environment:

```shell
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}

datadog-ci deployment mark --env prod --is-rollback
```

This set of commands specifies that the CI job executes a deployment to the `prod` environment and adds the `team:backend` and `reason:scheduled` tags to the deployment event:

```shell
export DD_BETA_COMMANDS_ENABLED=1
export DD_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export DD_SITE={{< region-param key="dd_site" >}}

datadog-ci deployment mark --env prod --tags team:backend --tags reason:scheduled
```

## Mark GitHub Actions jobs as deployments

To mark GitHub jobs as deployments, `datadog-ci CLI` version `2.29.0` or higher is required.
If the job name does not match the entry defined in the workflow configuration file (the GitHub [job ID][12]),
the `DD_GITHUB_JOB_NAME` environment variable needs to be exposed, pointing to the job name. For example:
1. If the job name is changed using the [name property][13]:
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      deploy:
        name: My deployment job name
        env:
          DD_GITHUB_JOB_NAME: My deployment job name
        steps:
        - run: datadog-ci deployment mark ...
    ```
2. If the [matrix strategy][14] is used, several job names are generated by GitHub by adding the matrix values at the end of the job name,
   within parenthesis. The `DD_GITHUB_JOB_NAME` environment variable should then be conditional on the matrix values:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      deployment:
        strategy:
          matrix:
            env: [dev, staging]
        env:
          DD_GITHUB_JOB_NAME: deployment (${{ matrix.env }})
        steps:
        - run: datadog-ci deployment mark ...
    ```
