## Overview

Facets are user-defined tags and attributes from your pipelines. They are useful for both [qualitative](#qualitative-facets) and [quantitative](#quantitative-measures) data analysis. Facets allow you to manipulate your pipelines in your [CD Pipelines monitors][1], and in search queries that appear on [dashboards][2] and in [notebooks][3].

[Creating facets](#creating-facets) is **not required** for [searching test runs or pipeline executions][5]. Autocomplete capabilities use existing facets, but also any input that matches incoming test runs or pipeline executions applies. 

The [CD Visibility Explorer][4] includes out-of-the-box facets such as `Test Status`, `Test Service`, `CD Status`, and `CD Provider`. You can use facets in the CD Visibility Explorer to:

- [Search for and filter test runs or pipeline executions][5].
- Perform test or pipeline analytics.
- Start troubleshooting once your test runs or pipelines complete.

Navigate to [**CD** > **Executions**][101] to access the list of facets left of the pipeline executions list.
