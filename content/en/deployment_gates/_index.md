Deployment Gates allow you to reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents caused by deployments.

When performing a production rollout, you can use Deployment Gates to evaluate the impact of the new changes by using [Monitors][1] and APM anomalies.
When anomalies or performance regressions are detected, you can automatically halt the release, preventing unstable code from reaching a wider user base. Additionally, you can then use Deployment Gates as the entry-point to investigate the problem.

For setup instructions, see [Set up Deployment Gates][2]. After the setup is completed, you can track and analyze gate evaluations through the [Deployment Gates Evaluations][3] page:
