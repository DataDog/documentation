The Deployment Gates UI provides two main functionalities.

First, you can use it to manage your gates and rules. For example, you can create new entities or modify the existing ones.

Then, you can use the UI to explore your gates and rules evaluations. Here, you can see the rules/gates that failed the most, and you can search, filter and aggregate the executions.
