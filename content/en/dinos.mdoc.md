## Herbivores

{% if equals($herbivores, "triceratops") %}
Triceratops was one of the last and largest herbivorous dinosaurs, living at the end of the Cretaceous period. This iconic dinosaur featured three distinctive horns and a large bony frill that likely served both defensive and display purposes. Despite its fearsome appearance, Triceratops was a plant-eater that used its powerful beak to slice through tough vegetation.

{% if equals($herbivores, "brachiosaurus") %}
Brachiosaurus was among the tallest dinosaurs ever discovered, with its long neck allowing it to reach vegetation over 40 feet above the ground. This massive sauropod weighed up to 80 tons and had front legs longer than its back legs, giving it a distinctive giraffe-like posture. Brachiosaurus spent most of its day eating, consuming hundreds of pounds of plant matter to sustain its enormous body.

{% if equals($herbivores, "stegosaurus") %}
Stegosaurus is instantly recognizable by the two rows of large bony plates running down its back and the four sharp spikes on its tail. These plates may have been used for temperature regulation or display, while the tail spikes served as a formidable defensive weapon against predators. Despite its large size, Stegosaurus had a brain roughly the size of a walnut, making it one of the least intelligent dinosaurs.

{% if equals($herbivores, "ankylosaurus") %}
Ankylosaurus was a heavily armored dinosaur covered in thick, bony plates and equipped with a massive club-like tail that could deliver devastating blows. This tank-like herbivore measured up to 33 feet long and weighed around 8 tons, making it nearly impervious to predator attacks. Its low-slung body and wide stance allowed it to graze on low-growing vegetation while remaining stable and well-protected.
{% /if %}

{% if equals($herbivores, "diplodocus") %}
Diplodocus was one of the longest dinosaurs, reaching lengths of up to 90 feet from head to tail tip. This gentle giant had a whip-like tail and an extremely long neck that it used to sweep across large areas of vegetation without moving its body. Diplodocus likely traveled in herds for protection and may have reared up on its hind legs to reach even taller plants.
