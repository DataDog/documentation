Datadog CoTerm is a CLI utility that can record terminal sessions and add a layer of validation to your terminal commands.

{{< img src="coterm/hero.png" alt="In Datadog, a page titled Terminal Session. An embedded video showing a terminal session. A scrubber bar controls video playback." style="width:100%;" >}}

With CoTerm, you can:

- **Record terminal sessions and analyze these recordings in Datadog**. 

   Investigating terminal sessions provides context about how system and security incidents were caused and remediated.
- **Protect against the accidental execution of dangerous terminal commands**.

   CoTerm can intercept terminal commands and warn you before you execute a risky command. For even more oversight, you can use CoTerm with [Datadog Case Management][3] to require approvals for particularly impactful commands.

For your security, CoTerm uses [Sensitive Data Scanner][2] to detect and obfuscate sensitive data, such as passwords and API keys.

## Review terminal sessions in Datadog

You can review your recorded terminal sessions and process data in Datadog:

- **As replays**: Watch [terminal sessions][6] in a video-like player.
- **As events**: In [Event Explorer][4], each recorded command appears as an event.
- **As logs**: In [Log Explorer][5], you can perform full-text searches and queries of terminal sessions as multi-line logs.

## Known limitations

- The maximum duration of a recorded session is approximately 24 hours.
- [Sensitive data redaction][2] can fail if the sensitive data is spread across multiple lines.
- On Linux, `seccomp`-based tracing prevents you from elevating your permissions during a recording.
