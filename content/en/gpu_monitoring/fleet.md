## Overview

The [GPU Fleet page][0] provides a detailed inventory of all of your GPU-accelerated hosts for a specified time frame. Use this view to uncover inefficiencies through resource telemetry, ranging from performance and usage metrics to costs. This page also surfaces any optimization recommendations for your devices, to help you maximize the value of your GPU spend. 

## Breakdown your infrastructure by cluster, host, or device

First select how you want to understand your GPU fleet using the toggle that groups your fleet by Kubernetes cluster, host (node), or GPU device:

{{< img src="gpu_monitoring/fleet_toggle.png" alt="Toggle for GPU fleet page that groups table results by Kubernetes Cluster, Host or Device." style="width:90%;" >}}

Your selection is used to populate the resulting table. If you select _Cluster_ or _Host_, you can click on the **`>`** button next to each table entry to view a cluster's hosts or a host's devices, respectively. 

{{< img src="gpu_monitoring/host_row_expansion.png" alt="A host entry in the table" style="width:90%;" >}}

**Note**: The Cluster table is only populated if you use Kubernetes.

### Explore your GPU fleet with filters and groupings

Use quick filter dropdowns at the top of the page to filter by a specific **Provider**, **Device Type**, **Cluster**, **Region**, **Service**, **Data Center**, **Environment** or **Team**.

You can also **Search** or **Group** by other tags in the fields shown below. For example, you can select the toggle for Host and then group by `Team` to view a table entry for each unique team. Click the **`>`** button next to any entry to see the hosts used by that team and the GPU devices accelerating those hosts. 

**Note**: You can only **Group by** one additional tag.

{{< img src="gpu_monitoring/filters_and_groupings.png" alt="The menu for filtering and grouping in the GPU Fleet page" style="width:90%;" >}}

Below the search and filtering fields, Datadog provides preset filters that allow you to instantly identify optimization opportunities for clusters, hosts, and devices with: 

- CPU saturation
- Ineffective devices (the streaming multiprocessor on the device is active less than 50% of the time)
- Inefficient devices (only if you've enabled System Probe; this shows devices where the GPU core utilization is less than 50%)
- Inactive devices (both the streaming multiprocessor and graphics engine are active less than 1% of the time)

## Summary Graph

After toggling Cluster, Host, or Device, the **Summary Graph** displays key resource telemetry across your entire GPU infrastructure grouped by that toggle value. Expand the section below to see a table of the available metrics and what they represent. 

{{% collapse-content title="See the full list of GPU metrics" level="h4" expanded=false id="gpu-metrics-table" %}}
| Metric                | Definition                                                              | Metric Name                                    |

{{% /collapse-content %}} 

If you've selected an additional tag to group by---for example, _team_---every unique timeseries in the Summary Graph corresponds to a team's value for the selected metric.

## Inventory of your GPU-powered infrastructure

This table breaks down your GPU-powered infrastructure by any tag of your choosing. If you haven't specified an additional tag in the **Group by** field, results are grouped by your toggle-selected view: Cluster, Host, or Device.

By default, the table of results displays the following columns: 

- Device Type 
- Graphics Engine Activity 
- SM Activity (Only if System Probe is enabled) 
- Core Utilization 
- Memory Utilization 
- Idle Cost
- Recommendation

You can click on the gear icon to customize which metrics are displayed within the table. Expand the section below to see a full list of the available metrics.

## Details side panel 

Clicking any row in the Fleet table opens a side panel with more details for the selected cluster, host, or device.

### Connected Entities 

Datadog's GPU Monitoring doesn't need to rely on NVIDIA'S DCGM Exporter. It uses the Datadog Agent to observe GPUs directly, providing insight into GPU usage and costs for pods and processes. Under the **Connected Entities** section in any detail view, you can see SM activity, GPU core utilization (only if System Probe is enabled), and the memory usage of pods, processes, and Slurm jobs. This helps you identify which workloads to cut or optimize to decrease total spend. 

**Note**: The **Pods** tab is only available if you're using Kubernetes.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Cluster side panel" %}}

Within this side panel, you have a cluster-specific funnel that identifies:

- Number of Total, Allocated, Active, and Effective devices within that particular cluster
- Estimated total and idle cost of that cluster
- Connected entities of that cluster: pods, processes, and Slurm jobs
- Four key metrics (customizable) for that cluster: Graphics Activity, SM Activity, Core Utilization (only if System probe is enabled), and Memory Utilization
- Table of hosts associated with that cluster

{{< img src="gpu_monitoring/cluster_sidepanel.png" alt="Cluster specific side panel that breaks down idle devices, costs and connected entities" style="width:100%;" >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Host side panel" %}}

Within this side panel, you have a host-specific view that identifies:

- Host-related metadata such as provider, instance type, CPU utilization, system memory used, system memory total, system IO util, SM activity, and temperature
- The specific GPU devices allocated to that host sorted by Graphics Engine Activity
- Connected Entities of that host: pods, processes, and Slurm jobs

{{< img src="gpu_monitoring/host_sidepanel.png" alt="Host specific side panel that displays the GPU devices tied to that host and Connected Entities" style="width:100%;" >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Device side panel" %}}

Within this side panel, you have a device-specific view that identifies:

- Recommendations (if any) for how to use this device more effectively 
- Device-related details: device type, SM activity, and temperature
- Four key metrics tied to GPUs: SM Activity, Memory Utilization, Power, and Graphics Engine Activity 
- Connected Entities of that cluster: pods and processes

{{< img src="gpu_monitoring/device_sidepanel.png" alt="Device specific side panel that displays recommendations for how to use the device more effectively and other key telemetry." style="width:100%;" >}}

## Installation Recommendations

Datadog actively surveys your infrastructure and detects installation gaps that may diminish the value you get out of GPU Monitoring. In this modal, you can find installation update recommendations to get the optimal value of GPU Monitoring. For example, making sure your hosts have the [latest version][1] of the Datadog Agent installed, installing the latest version of the NVIDIA driver, and checking for misconfigured hosts.

To view advanced GPU Monitoring features such as attribution of GPU resources by related processes or SLURM jobs, you must enable [Live Processes][3] and the [Slurm][4] integration, respectively.
