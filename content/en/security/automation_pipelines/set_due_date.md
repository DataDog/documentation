Configure due date rules to ensure findings are addressed within your specified SLO time frames. By setting these due dates, you can automate accountability, meet compliance requirements, and prioritize the prompt remediation of security issues, thereby preventing potential exploitation.

## Create a due date rule

1. On the [Automation Pipelines][2] page, click **Add a New Rule** and select **Set Due Date**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the rule, for example, **Cloud Infrastructure Anomaly Warnings**.
1. Use the following boxes to configure the rule criteria:
    - **Any of these types**: The types of findings that the rule should check for. Available types include:
      - **Application Code Vulnerability**
      - **Application Library Vulnerability**
      - **Container Image Vulnerability**
      - **Misconfiguration**
      - **Attack Path**
      - **Identity Risk**
      - **API Security Finding**
      - **Host Vulnerability**
    - **Any of these tags or attributes**: The resource tags or attributes that must match for the rule to apply.
1. Set a due date for each severity level that needs one. The due date starts from when the matching finding was discovered, not when the rule was created.
1. Click **Save**. The rule applies to new findings immediately and starts checking existing findings within the next hour.

## Where due dates appear

When a finding has a due date, you can see it in these locations:

- Explorer facets
- Findings side panel
- Notifications
- Jira ticket descriptions
- Reporting metrics (as an "overdue" Boolean) to identify teams or repositories with the most overdue vulnerabilities

## Rule matching order

When Datadog identifies a finding, it evaluates the finding against your sequence of due date rules. Starting with the first rule, if there's a match, Datadog sets a due date on the finding for the specified duration and stops evaluating further. If no match occurs, Datadog moves to the next rule. This process continues until a match is found or all rules are checked without a match.

## Removing due dates

When managing findings, due dates can be removed under various conditions, such as:

- The detection rule that triggered the finding passes successfully.
- The finding is muted, either manually or automatically through a mute rule.
- The due date rule associated with the finding is disabled or deleted.
- The associated due date rule is modified so that its criteria no longer match the finding.
