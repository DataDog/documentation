Configure mute rules to streamline security alerts by automatically filtering out non-urgent findings. This approach helps reduce noise from known false positives and accepted risks, allowing you to focus on addressing the most critical threats.

## Create a mute rule

1. On the [Automation Pipelines][2] page, click **Add a New Rule** and select **Mute**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the rule, for example, Cloud Infrastructure Anomaly Warnings.
1. Use the following boxes to configure the rule criteria:
    - **Any of these types**: The types of findings that the rule should check for. Available types include **Misconfiguration**, **Attack Path**, **Identity Risk**, and **API Security Finding**.
    - **Any of these tags or attributes**: The resource tags or attributes that must match for the rule to apply.
1. To add severity criteria to the rule, click **Add Severity**.
1. Specify the mute reason and duration:
    - **Reason for muting**: The reason for muting the finding. Available reasons include **Duplicate**, **External solution**, **Pending fix**, **False positive**, **Internal solution**, **No fix available**, **Accepted risk**, and **Other**.
    - **Rule expiration**: The date on which the rule expires. 
    - **Further description for muting reason**: Optional box for additional details.
1. Click **Save**.

## Rule matching order

When Datadog identifies a vulnerability, it evaluates the vulnerability against your sequence of mute rules. Starting with the first rule, if there's a match, Datadog mutes the vulnerability for the specified duration and stops evaluating further. If no match occurs, Datadog moves to the next rule. This process continues until a match is found or all rules are checked without a match.
