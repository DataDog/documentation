## Overview

When [creating a new detection rule or modifying an existing one][1], use [template variables](#template-variables) (such as attributes and signal tags) and [conditional variables](#conditional-variables) to customize a rule's notification message. When a signal is generated from the rule, the variables are populated with values related to that signal. 

## Template Variables

Use template variables to inject dynamic context from triggered logs or traces directly into a security signal and its associated notifications.

The following variables are available:

| Variable                                           | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{severity}}`                                     | The severity of the triggering rule case (integer, 0-4).                                      |
| `{{timestamp}}`                                    | Time the signal was created. For example, `Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 1970`.                     |
| `{{timestamp_epoch}}`                              | Time the signal was created, in milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970.                 |
| `{{first_seen}}`                                   | Time the signal was first seen. For example, `Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 1970`.                  |
| `{{first_seen_epoch}}`                             | Time the signal was first seen, in milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970.              |
| `{{last_seen}}`                                    | Time the signal was most recently triggered. For example, `Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 1970`.     |
| `{{last_seen_epoch}}`                              | Time the signal was most recently triggered, in milliseconds, since midnight, January 1, 1970.|
| `{{rule_name}}`                                    | Name of the associated rule.                                                                  |
| `{{case_name}}`                                    | Name of the triggering rule case.                                                             |
| `{{events_matched}}`                               | Number of events that have matched the associated rule.                                       |
| `{{events_matched_per_query.<name_of_the_query>}}` | Number of events that have matched the associated rule query `<name_of_the_query>`.           |

When a large number of logs match a rule, the rule's title and message are not rendered for every new log. In these cases, the rendered values of `{{events_matched}}` and `{{events_matched_per_query.<name_of_the_query>}}` could be below the values displayed in the Overview tab of the signal's side panel.

### Dynamic links

Use template variables to dynamically link to a related resource for your investigation. 

For example, if a signal detects a suspicious user login, use `{{@user.id}}` to create a dynamic link to another resource:

```
* [Investigate user in the authentication dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/example/integration/security-monitoring---authentication-events?tpl_var_username={{@usr.id}})
```

Or, if a signal is tagged with a specific service, use the `{{@service}}` variable to create a dynamic link:

```
* [Investigate service in the services dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/example/integration/application-security---service-events?tpl_var_service={{@service}})
```

### Evaluation of numerical values

For template variables that return numerical values, use `eval` to perform mathematical operations or change the value's format. For more information, see [Template Variable Evaluation][2].

### Epoch

Epoch template variables create a human-readable string or math-friendly number within a notification. For example, use values such as `first_seen`, `last_seen`, or `timestamp` (in milliseconds) within a function to receive a readable string in a notification. For example:

```
{{eval "first_seen_epoch-15*60*1000"}}
```

For more information on the `eval` function, see [Template Variable Evaluation][2].

### Local time

Use the `local_time` function to add another date in your notification in the time zone of your choice. This function transforms a date into its local time: `{{local_time "time_variable" "timezone"}}`.

For example, to add the last triggered time of the signal in the Tokyo time zone in your notification, include the following in the notification message:

```
{{local_time "last_triggered_at" "Asia/Tokyo"}}
```

The result is displayed in the ISO 8601 format: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssÂ±HH:mm`, for example, `2021-05-31 23:43:27+09:00`. See the [list of TZ database time zones][3], specifically the `TZ database name` column, to see the list of available time zone values.

## Attribute variables

<div class="alert alert-warning">
HIPAA-enabled Datadog organizations have access to only <a href="#template-variables">template variables</a> for security notifications. Attribute variables are not supported.
</div>

Use attribute variables to customize signal notifications with specific information about the triggered signal. 

To see a signal's list of event attributes, click **JSON** at the bottom of the **Overview** tab in the signal's side panel. Use the following syntax to add these event attributes in your rule notifications: `{{@attribute}}`. To access inner keys of the event attributes, use JSON dot notation, for example, `{{@attribute.inner_key}})`.

The following is an example JSON object with event attributes that may be associated with a security signal:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Cloud SIEM" %}}

```json
{
  "network": {
    "client": {
      "ip": "1.2.3.4"
    }
  },
  "usr": {
    "id": "user@domain.com"
  },
  "evt": {
    "category": "authentication",
    "outcome": "success"
  },
  "used_mfa": "false"
}
```

If you use the following in the **Say what's happening** section:

```
{{@usr.id}} just logged in without MFA from {{@network.client.ip}}.
```
This is what the notification message looks like:

```
user@domain.com just logged in without MFA from 1.2.3.4.
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Application Security Management" %}}

```json
{
  "attributes":{
    "title":"Security scanner detected",
    "http":{
      "url":"http://www.example.com"
    },
    "rule":{
      "detectionMethod":"threshold",
      "name":"Your rule name"
    },
    "events_matched":2,
    "first_seen":"2022-01-26T13:23:33.000Z",
    "last_seen":"2022-01-27T04:01:57.000Z"
  },
  "groupByPaths":[
    "service"
  ]
}
```

If you use the following in the Say What's Happening section:

```
Real routes targeted for {{@service}}.
```

The notification shows the service name in the message as follows:

```
Real routes targeted for your_service_name.
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### More examples

Use `{{@network.client.ip}}` to display the IP address(es) associated with the signal.

If a security rule detects a user logging in from an IP address known to be malicious, use the template variables `{{@usr.id}}` and `{{@network.client.ip}}` to see which user and IP address triggered the signal. For example:

```
The user {{@usr.id}} just successfully authenticated from {{@network.client.ip}} which is a known malicious IP address.
```
## Tag variables

Use the following syntax to add a tag variable to your rule's notification message: `{{tag_name}}`. 

For tags following the `key:value` syntax, use the variable: `{{key.name}}`. This renders the value associated with the key in the notification. For example, if a signal has the tag key `region`, use the variable `{{region.name}}` in your notification message.

There is no need to use `@` to access the tag value.

If a tag key includes a period, use brackets around the full key when using a tag variable. For example, if your tag is `dot.key.test:five`, use `{{[dot.key.test].name}}`.

### Dynamic handles

Use tag variables to dynamically build notification handles and route notifications to a specific team or service based on the security signal generated.
For example, if a signal has a `service` tag, you can have your notifications routed to different Slack channels based on the failing service:
```
@slack-{{service.name}} There is a security issue with {{service.name}}.
```

For example, if the signal has the `service:ad-server`, the notification is sent to the `#ad-server` Slack channel with the following content:

```
@slack-ad-server There is an ongoing issue with ad-server.
```

## Conditional variables

Conditional variables use if-else logic to display a message based on the details of the signal triggered. These variables can be used in the title or notification message.

The following conditional variables are available:

| Variable              | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{#is_match}}`       | The context matches the provided substring.               |
| `{{^is_match}}`       | The context does not match the provided substring.        |
| `{{#is_exact_match}}` | The context exactly matches the provided string.          |
| `{{^is_exact_match}}` | The context does not exactly match the provided string.   |
| `{{#if}}`             | The attribute exists.                                     |

Conditional variables must have an opening and closing pair with the text and @-notifications in between. For example:
```
{{#is_match "<tag_variable>.name" "<comparison_string>"}}
  This displays if <comparison_string> is included in <tag_variable>.
{{/is_match}}
```

### Examples

Use if-else logic to see if an attribute exists::

```
{{#if @network.client.ip}}The attribute IP attribute exists.{{/if}}
```

Use if-else logic to see if an attribute matches a value:

```
{{#is_exact_match "@network.client.ip" "1.2.3.4"}}The ip matched.{{/is_exact_match}}
```

## Additional information

### Raw format

Use the `{{{{raw}}}}` format if your signal notification needs to send double curly braces, such as `{{ <TEXT> }}`. For example, the following syntax:

```
{{{{raw}}}}
{{ <TEXT_1> }} {{ <TEXT_2> }}
{{{{/raw}}}}
```

Outputs:

```
{{ <TEXT_1> }} {{ <TEXT_2> }}
```

The `^|#` helpers used in conditional variables cannot be used with the `{{{{raw}}}}` format and must be removed. For instance, to output raw text with the `{{is_match}}` conditional variable, use the following template:

```
{{{{is_match "host.name" "<HOST_NAME>"}}}}
{{ .matched }} the host name
{{{{/is_match}}}}
```

If `host.name` matches `<HOST_NAME>`, the template outputs:

```
{{ .matched }} the host name
```

### URL Encode

If your signal notification includes information that needs to be encoded in a URL (for example, for redirections), use the `{{ urlencode "<variable>"}}` syntax.

**Example**: If your signal message includes a URL to the Service Catalog filtered to a specific service, use the `service` [tag variable](#attribute-and-tag-variables) and add the `{{ urlencode "<variable>"}}` syntax to the URL:

```
https://app.datadoghq.com/services/{{urlencode "service.name"}}
```
