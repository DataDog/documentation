## Overview

Security notification rules play a key role in keeping your team informed of issues without you having to manually edit notification preferences for individual detection rules. Notification rules can span across multiple detection rules and signals based on parameters such as severities, rule types, rule tags, signal attributes, and signal tags.

## Create notification rules

To create a notification rule, you define the logic for when the notification rule is triggered based on conditions such as severity, detection rule type, tags, and attributes.

As you configure the rule, a preview of issues matching the notification rule conditions appears on the **Example of matching issues** panel. This can be useful in determining if the notification rule is too specific or broad.

1. On the [**Notification Rules**][1] page, click **New Notification Rule**.
2. Under **Source Types**, select the detection rule types you want to include in the notification rule.
3. (Optional) For ASM, select the ASM Vulnerability Management source type, _or_ leave the source type empty and select the **Include Application level vulnerabilities** checkbox.
4. Under **Rule Criteria**, select one or more severity levels.
5. Specify the tags and attributes that must be present in order for the notification rule to be triggered.
6. Under **Notification Details**, specify the recipients you want to notify when the notification rule is triggered. You can notify individuals, teams, create Jira issues, and more. See [Notifications][2] for more information.
7. Enter a name for the notification rule.
8. Click **Save and Activate**.

If the notification rule matches the specified conditions, the resulting notification includes details about the matched notification rule in the notification footer.
