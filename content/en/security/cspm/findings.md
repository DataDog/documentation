## Overview

The [Findings Explorer][1] allows you to:

- Review the detailed configuration of a resource
- Review the detection rules applied to your resources by CSPM
- Review tags for more context about who owns the resource and where it resides in your environment
- Read descriptions and guidelines based on industry resources for remediating a misconfigured resource
- Use the “time selector” to explore your security configuration posture at any point in the past.

In addition to reviewing and responding to findings, you can set notifications for failed findings, and configure signals to correlate and triage misconfigurations in the same view as real-time threats generated by [Cloud SIEM][2] and [Cloud Workload Security][3]. This allows users to accelerate investigations as the root-cause for many of today’s cloud breaches are misconfigured services that have been nefariously exploited.

## Findings

A finding is the primary primitive for a rule evaluation against a resource. Every time a resource is evaluated against a rule, a finding is generated with a **Pass** or **Fail** status. Resources are evaluated in increments between 15 minutes and four hours (depending on type). Datadog generates new findings as soon as a new scan is completed, and stores a complete history of all findings for the past 15 months so they are available in case of an investigation or audit.

## Explore your cloud misconfigurations with Findings

Clicking on an individual finding that has **failed** to see details about the misconfigured resource, the rule description, its framework or industry benchmark mapping, and suggested remediation steps.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/signal-overview.png" alt="Failed signals in the side panel" style="width:65%;">}}

Aggregate findings by rule using the query search bar. This view shows a checklist of all of the detection rules that Datadog scans. Filtering by `evaluation:fail` status narrows the list to all detection rules that have issues that need to be addressed. The side panel shows details of each resource that has been evaluated by the rule.

The side panel shows details of each resource that has been evaluated by the rule.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/no-security-group-ingress.png" alt="Ranked order resources in the side panel" style="width:65%;">}}

Findings can also be aggregated by resource to rank order resources that have failed the most rule evaluations so you can prioritize remediation.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/eval-fail-group-by-resource.png" alt="Group and aggregate by resource in search" style="width:100%;">}}

The side panel lists detection rules that were evaluated against the resource, some of which you may choose to be addressed to improve your security configuration posture.

## Mute findings

{{< callout url="" btn_hidden="true" >}}
  Muted findings is a beta feature available to all CSPM customers. If you have feedback or questions, contact <a href="/help">Datadog support</a>.
{{< /callout >}} 

Sometimes, a finding does not match the use case for your business, or you choose to accept it as a known risk. To ignore these findings, mute the finding for the impacted resource so you can focus on high-severity and critical findings.

For example, the ['Block Public Access' feature is enabled for S3 bucket][4] rule evaluates whether an S3 bucket is publicly accessible. If you have an S3 bucket with static assets that are meant to be publicly shared, you can mute the finding for the S3 bucket.

You can mute pass/fail findings at any time. Muting a finding removes it from the calculation of your posture score.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/muted-findings.png" alt="The Mute findings dialog box contains fields for specifying the reason and duration of the mute" style="width:100%;">}}

1. On the [finding side panel](#explore-your-cloud-misconfigurations-with-findings), select a resource.
2. Click **Mute**.
3. Select a reason for the mute, for example, a fix is pending, it's a false positive, or it's an accepted risk.
4. Enter an optional **Description**.
5. Select the duration of the mute.
6. Click **Mute**.

### Unmute a finding

Muted findings automatically unmute after the specified mute duration expires. You can also manually unmute a finding.

1. On the [finding side panel](#explore-your-cloud-misconfigurations-with-findings), select the resource with the muted finding.
2. Click **Unmute**.
3. Select a reason for the unmute, for example, there's no pending fix, it was a human error, or it's no longer an accepted risk.
4. Enter an optional **Description**.
5. Click **Unmute**.

### Audit your muted findings

You can view your organization's muted findings, review whether a muted finding is currently in a pass or fail state, and audit the history for a resource to determine when and by whom a finding was muted.

To view your organization's muted findings:

- Sort by the **Muted** column on the Security Findings Explorer.
- Filter the Security Findings Explorer using the **Muted** facet.

To audit the history for a resource:

1. Open the [finding side panel](#explore-your-cloud-misconfigurations-with-findings).
2. Select the resource with the muted finding.
3. If the finding status has changed, click **See Latest State**.
4. Click **View Finding**.

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/muted-findings-timeline-graph.png" alt="The resource evaluation over time timeline shows the history of the finding including periods when it was muted" style="width:100%;">}}

On the **Message** tab, use the **Resource evaluation over time** timeline to view when the finding was muted or unmuted over a specified period of time (up to six months).

{{< img src="security/cspm/findings/muted-findings-timeline.png" alt="The Timeline tab shows a chronological history of the finding including details on when a finding was muted" style="width:100%;">}}

Click the **Timeline** tab to view a chronological history of the finding. Hover over a mute or unmute action to view additional details, such as the reason for the mute, how long the mute was intended to last, and who muted it.
