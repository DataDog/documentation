## How it works

The Security Research and Detection Engineering teams continuously monitor the threat landscape and publish updates as soon as new threats emerge. This ensures security professionals have access to:

- Expert analysis on the latest security trends.
- Contextual information to assess the impact of a vulnerability or threat.
- Guidance on implementing effective detection and response strategies.

## Criteria for emerging vulnerabilities

An emerging vulnerability is a security weakness in a technology that significantly threatens business operations and is defined by one or more of the following criteria:

- **Widespread impact**: The vulnerability affects a large number of systems or organizations, creating a broad attack surface.
- **High severity**: Its exploitability and potential damage make it an immediate security concern.
- **Significant visibility**: The issue is widely discussed in security communities and mainstream news, increasing awareness and urgency.

## Criteria for emerging threats

An emerging threat is a new or evolving attack campaign or supply-chain attack that has disrupted or poses a significant threat to business operations. It is defined by one or more of the following criteria:

- **Widespread impact**: The threat has already affected a large number of systems or organizations, either through broad, opportunistic attacks, or targeted campaigns.
- **Imminent threat**: The threat has already caused impact or is expected to escalate, with near-term attacks likely to affect many organizations.
- **Significant visibility**: The issue is widely discussed in security communities and mainstream news, increasing awareness and urgency.
