## Overview

Cloud Security Management Vulnerabilities (CSM Vulnerabilities) combines infrastructure observability with security insights to detect, prioritize, and manage vulnerabilities in your organization. It scans for vulnerabilities in the [container images][2] and [hosts][4] in your infrastructure.

## Review the health of your container images
CSM Vulnerabilities offers vulnerabilities in the container images on your hosts.

- View your container images on the [container images][2] page. 
- Observe the number of vulnerabilities that exist in the container images (column name `VULNERABILITIES`).

View additional details about any vulnerability by clicking the container image and reviewing the **Vulnerabilities** tab:
