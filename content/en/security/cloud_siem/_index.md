## Overview

Datadog Cloud SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) unifies developer, operation, and security teams on one platform. Use a single dashboard to display DevOps content, business metrics, and security insights. Cloud SIEM detects threats to your applications and infrastructure, such as targeted attacks, communications from threat intel-listed IP addresses, and insecure configurations, in real time. Notify your team of these security issues by email, Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, or webhooks.

Threats are surfaced in Datadog as Security Signals and can be correlated and triaged in the [Security Signals Explorer][1]. Security Signals are generated by Datadog Cloud SIEM with [Detection Rules][2]. Detection Rules detect threats across different sources and are available out of the box for immediate use. You can clone any of the provided detection rules to change the configuration. You can also add a [new rule][3] from scratch to fit your specific use case.
