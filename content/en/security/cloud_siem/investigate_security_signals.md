## Overview

A Cloud SIEM security signal is created when Datadog detects a threat while analyzing logs against detection rules. View, search, filter, and correlate security signals in the Signal Explorer without needing to learn a dedicated query language. You can also assign security signals to yourself or another user in the Datadog platform. In addition to the Signal Explorer, you can configure [Notification Rules][1] to send signals to specific individuals or teams to keep them informed of issues.

You must have the `Security Signals Write` permission to modify a security signal, such as change the state and view signal action history in [Audit Trail][2]. See [Role Based Access Control][3] for more information about Datadog's default roles and granular role-based access control permissions available for Datadog Security in the Cloud Security.

## View signals by status in the Signal Explorer

In the Signals Explorer, use the facet panel or search bar to group and filter your signals. For example, to view all signals with a `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` severity that are in the `open` or `under review` triage state, do one of the following: 

- In the facet panel's **Severity** section, select **Critical**, **High**, and **Medium**. In the **Signal State** section, make sure only **open** and **under_reviewed** are selected.
- In the search bar, enter `status:(high OR critical OR medium) @workflow.triage.state:(open OR under_review)`.

To add the column **Signal State**, select the **Options** button in the top right corner above the table and add the facet: `@workflow.triage.state`. This displays the signal status and allows you to sort by status through the header.

Use different visualizations to investigate the threat activity in your environment. For example, in the **Visualize by** field, you can group signals by:

- Rules List to see the volume and alerting trends across the different detection rules.
- Timeseries to view signal trends over time.
- Pie chart to see the relative volume of each of the detection rules.

After you have filtered your signals to your use case, create a [saved view][4] so that you can reload your query later.

## Triage a signal or multiple signals

1. Navigate to [Cloud SIEM][5].
1. Click **Signals**.
1. Click on a security signal from the table.
1. To assign a signal to yourself or another Datadog user, click the user profile icon with the plus sign in the top left corner of the signal side panel.
{{< img src="security/security_monitoring/investigate_security_signals/profile_icon.png" alt="The profile icon next to the triage status" style="width:45%;" >}}
1. To update the triage status of the security signal, navigate to the top left corner of the signal side panel and select the status you want from the dropdown menu. The default status is `OPEN`.
{{< img src="security/security_monitoring/investigate_security_signals/triage_status.png" alt="The profile icon next to the triage status" style="width:35%;" >}}
    - **Open**: Datadog Security triggered a detection based on a rule, and the resulting signal is not yet resolved.
    - **Under Review**: During an active investigation, you can switch the signal state to **Under Review**. From the **Under Review** state, you can move the signal state to **Archived** or **Open** as needed.
    - **Archived**: When the detection that caused the signal has been resolved, you can transition it to the **Archived** state. If an archived issue resurfaces, or if further investigation is necessary, a signal can be changed back to an **Open** state within 30 days of being created.

Use bulk actions to triage multiple signals. To use bulk actions, first search and filter your signals in the Signal Explorer, then:

1. Click on the checkbox to the left of the signals that you want to take a bulk action on. To select all signals in the Signal Explorer list, select the checkbox next to the **Status** column header.
1. Click on the **Bulk Actions** dropdown menu above the signals table and select the action you want to take.

**Note**: The Signals Explorer stops dynamically updating when performing a bulk action.

### Case Management

Sometimes you need more information than what is available in a single signal to investigate the signal. Use [Case Management][6] to collect multiple signals, create timelines, discuss with colleagues, and keep a notebook of the analysis and findings.

To create a case from a security signal:

1. Click the **Escalate Investigation** dropdown menu.
2. Select **Create a case** to start a security investigation.

**Note**: If a case is determined to be critical after further investigation, click **Declare Incident** in the case to escalate it to an incident.

### Declare an incident

Whether it is based on a single signal or after an investigation of a case, certain malicious activity demands a response. You can declare incidents in Datadog to bring together developers, operations, and security teams to address a critical security event. [Incident Management][7] provides a framework and workflow to help teams effectively identify and mitigate incidents.

To declare an incident in the signal panel:

1. Click the **Escalate Investigation** dropdown menu.
2. Select **Declare incident**.
3. Fill out the incident template.

### Workflow automation

You can trigger a Workflow automatically for any Security Signal. You can also manually trigger a Workflow from a Cloud SIEM Security Signal. See [Trigger a Workflow from a Security Signal][8] and [Automate Security Workflows with Workflow Automation][9] for more information.

### Threat intelligence

Datadog Cloud SIEM offers integrated threat intelligence provided by our threat intelligence partners. These feeds are constantly updated to include data about known suspicious activity (for example, IP addresses known to be used by malicious actors), so that you can quickly identify which potential threats to address.

Datadog automatically enriches all ingested logs for indicators of compromise (IOCs) from our threat intelligence feeds. If a log contains a match to a known IOC, a `threat_intel` attribute is appendeded to the log event to provide additional insights based on available intelligence.

The query to see all threat intelligence matches in the Security Signals Explorer is `@threat_intel.indicators_matched:*`. The following are additional attributes to query for threat intelligence:

- For `@threat_intel.results.category`: attack, corp_vpn, cryptomining, malware, residential_proxy, tor, scanner
- For `@threat_intel.results.intention`: malicious, suspicious, benign, unknown

{{< img src="security/security_monitoring/investigate_security_signals/threat_intel_results_categories.png" alt="The Signal Explorer showing a bar graph of signals broken down by the threat intel categories of residential proxy, corp_vpn, cryptomining, and malware" style="width:80%;" >}}

See the [Threat Intelligence][10] documentation for more information on threat intelligence feeds.

### Search by network IP attributes

When a suspicious activity is detected from your logs, determine whether the suspicious actor has interacted with your systems by searching for its network IP. Use the following query to search by IP attributes in the Log Explorer: `@network.ip.list:<IP address>`. The query searches IPs anywhere within the logs, including the tags, attributes, error, and message fields.

You can also launch this query directly from the signal panel:
1. Click on the IP address in the **Context** section.
2. Select **View Logs with @network.client.ip:<ip_address>**.
