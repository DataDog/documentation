## Overview

Cloud SIEM Entities consolidates multiple data sources, such as threats and vulnerabilities, into a profile representing a single security entity, such as a Cloudtrail session or IAM user.

With Cloud SIEM Entities, you can:

- Explore entities, sorting them by risk score or querying them by tag, signal detection count, and more.
- View all data relevant to an entity, such as signals, misconfigurations, and identity risks.
- Take mitigation steps such as adding a global suppression or creating a global case for an entity.
