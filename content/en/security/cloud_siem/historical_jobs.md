Historical Jobs is in private beta.

Historical Jobs allows you to backtest detections by running them against historical logs stored in Datadog Cloud SIEM. 

Unlike a real-time rule, a Historical Job does not run continuously. Historical Jobs are one-time executable queries that analyze a specified period of historical data.

The results of Historical Jobs are lightweight versions of signals, providing essential insights into potential threats or anomalies identified within the historical logs.

If immediate action is needed after reviewing the results generated by the Historical Job, you can confidently promote a subset of those results to signals. When converting a result to a signal, you can manually set the signal severity and the notification target, as well as the signal playbook.

1. Click the three-dot menu next to the rule you want to test, and choose **Run as Historical Job**.
