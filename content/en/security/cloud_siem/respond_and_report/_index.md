## Overview

Datadog Security Orchestration, Automations, and Respond (SOAR) helps you orchestrate security operations, investigate signals, and remediate threats using [Workflow Automation][1]. For example, you can [run a workflow][2] to:

- Block an IP address from your environment.
- Disable a user account.
- Look up an IP address with a third-party threat intelligence provider.
- Send Slack messages to your colleagues to get help with your investigation.
- Assign signals for investigation.
- Automatically enrich cases and close duplicate cases.

SOAR also includes ready-to-use customizable [blueprints][4] to help you build workflows for remediating threats. For example:

- An Identity and Access Management (IAM) workflow that automates responses to suspicious logins and account compromises.
- An Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) workflow that speeds up the investigation and containment of endpoint threats.
- A Threat Intelligence Enrichment workflow that enriches alerts with external data so you can prioritize and respond more effectively.

Cloud SIEM also provides [security operational metrics][3], so you can determine the efficiency and effectiveness of your security processes.
