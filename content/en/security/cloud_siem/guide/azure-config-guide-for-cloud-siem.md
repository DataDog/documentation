## Overview

Cloud SIEM applies detection rules to all processed logs in Datadog to detect threats, like a targeted attack, a threat intel listed IP communicating with your systems, or an insecure resource modification. The threats are surfaced as Security Signals in the Security Signals Explorer for triaging.

This guide walks you through configuring Microsoft Azure to send logs to Datadog so that you can start detecting threats on your Azure Platform logs.

<div class="alert alert-info">The Azure Native integration (available for customers on Datadog's US3 site) has different log collection setup instructions. If you are using the Azure Native integration, select <strong>US3</strong> in the Datadog Site dropdown menu and follow the instructions in <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/guide/azure-native-logging-guide/">Microsoft Azure log collection</a>. </div>

## Use Cloud SIEM to triage Security Signals

Cloud SIEM applies out-of-the-box detection rules to all processed logs, including the Azure Platform logs you have just set up. When a threat is detected with a detection rule, a Security Signal is generated and can be viewed in the Security Signals Explorer.

- Go to the Cloud SIEM Signals Explorer to view and triage threats. See Security Signals Explorer for further details.
- See out-of-the-box detection rules that are applied to your logs.
- Create new rules to detect threats that match your specific use case.
