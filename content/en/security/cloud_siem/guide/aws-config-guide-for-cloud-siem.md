## Overview

Cloud SIEM applies detection rules to all processed logs in Datadog to detect threats, like a targeted attack, a threat intel listed IP communicating with your systems, or an insecure configuration. The threats are surfaced as Security Signals in the [Security Signals Explorer][1] for triaging.

This guide walks you through the following steps so that you can start detecting threats with your AWS CloudTrail logs:

1. [Set up Datadog's AWS integration](#set-up-aws-integration-using-cloudformation)
2. [Enable AWS CloudTrail logs](#enable-aws-cloudtrail-logging)
3. [Send AWS CloudTrail logs to Datadog](#send-aws-cloudtrail-logs-to-datadog)
4. [Use Cloud SIEM to triage Security Signals](#use-cloud-siem-to-triage-security-signals)

## Set up AWS integration using CloudFormation

{{% cloud-siem-aws-setup-cloudformation %}}

## Enable AWS CloudTrail logging 

{{% cloud-siem-aws-cloudtrail-enable %}}

## Send AWS CloudTrail logs to Datadog

{{% cloud-siem-aws-cloudtrail-send-logs %}}

## Use Cloud SIEM to triage Security Signals

Cloud SIEM applies out of the box detection rules to all processed logs, including the CloudTrail logs you have just set up. When a threat is detected with a Detection Rule, a Security Signal is generated and can be viewed in the Security Signals Explorer.

- Go to the [Cloud SIEM Signals Explorer][9] to view and triage threats. See [Security Signals Explorer][10] for further details.
- You can also use the [AWS CloudTrail dashboard][11] to investigate anomalous activity.
- See [out-of-the-box detection rules][12] that are applied to your logs.
- Create [new rules][13] to detect threats that match your specific use case.

Since Cloud SIEM applies detection rules to all processed logs, see the [in-app instructions][14] on how to collect [Kubernetes audit logs][15] and logs from other sources for threat detection. You can also enable different [AWS services][16] to log to a S3 bucket and send them to Datadog for threat monitoring.
