Use the [Jira integration][1] to create Jira issues for resources that are impacted by a Cloud Security Management (CSM) security issue. Jira for Cloud Security Management is available for [CSM Misconfigurations][3] and [CSM Identity Risks][4].

**Notes**:
- To create Jira issues, you must have the `security_monitoring_findings_write` permission. See [Role Based Access Control][2] for more information about Datadog's default roles and granular role-based access control permissions available for CSM.
- At this time, you can create only one Jira issue per finding.

## Configure the Jira integration

To create Jira issues for CSM security issues, you must configure the [Jira integration][5]. For detailed instructions, see the [Jira][1] integration docs.
