You can use resource tags to create filters that include or exclude resources from being evaluated by Cloud Security Management (CSM). The filters must be specified as a comma-separated list of `key:value` pairs.

**Notes**:

- Resource evaluation filters can only be used with hosts that are scanned by cloud integrations.
- Tags must be applied directly to the resource. The filters do not take into account user tags added in Datadog. The only exception is for tags added on the integration tiles for AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

| Format                       | Value        |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Allowlist                    | `key:value`  |
| Blocklist                    | `!key:value` |
| Single character wildcard    | `?`          |
| Multiple characters wildcard | `*`          |

The allowlist enables you to specify tags that must be applied to a resource in order for CSM to evaluate it. Allowlist tags are evaluated as OR statements. In other words, at least one of the allowlist tags must be present in order for a resource to be evaluated. In contrast, blocklisted tags are evaluated as AND statements and take precedence over allowlist tags.

**Examples**:

- `!env:staging` excludes resources that have the `env:staging` tag.
- `datadog:monitored, env:prod*` collects metrics for resources that have at least one of these tags.
- `!env:staging, !testing` excludes resources that have both the `env:staging` and `testing` tags.
- `datadog:monitored !region:us-east1` collects metrics for resources that have the `datadog:monitored` tag, so long as the resource does not have the `region:us-east1` tag applied to it.
