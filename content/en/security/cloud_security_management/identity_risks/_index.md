Cloud Security Management Identity Risks (CSM Identity Risks) provides in-depth visibility into your organization's IAM risks. It enables you to proactively detect and resolve identity risks on an ongoing basis to secure your cloud infrastructure from IAM-based attacks.

<div class="alert alert-info">At this time, CSM Identity Risks is available for AWS only.</div>

## Review identity risks

Review your organization's active identity risks on the [Identity Risks Explorer][1]. Use the **Group by** options to filter by **Identity Risks**, **Resources**, or **None** (individual identity risks). View additional details on the side panel.

CSM Identity Risk detections include users, roles, groups, policies, EC2 instances, and Lambda functions.

## Remediate identity risks

For detailed insights and remediation help, click the **Insights** tab. In the following example, the **Insights** tab shows the usage of provisioned permissions.

Click **View Suggested Policy** to view a suggested downsized policy based on the actual usage.

To remediate the identity risk, click **Fix in AWS** to update the resource in AWS IAM console. To create a Jira issue and assign it to a team, click **Create Jira issue**. See [Create Jira Issues for Cloud Security Management Issues][2] for more information.

You can also leverage [Workflow Automation][3] to create automated workflows for identity risks (with or without human involvement). See [Automate Security Workflows with Workflow Automation][3] for more information.
