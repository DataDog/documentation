With custom frameworks, you can define and measure compliance against your own cloud security baseline. Custom frameworks are listed on the Cloud Security Management (CSM) [Compliance][6] page, have their own real-time report and [security posture score][7], and are queryable within explorers and dashboards.

1. On the [CSM Compliance page][6], click **Create Framework**.
1. Enter the following details:
    - **Framework name**: The name of your framework. Can include characters, numbers, and spaces. Must be at least five characters long.
    - **Handle**: The tag name for the custom framework. Can include lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and periods. This value is used to query the framework in the explorer or in dashboards.
    - **Version**: The version of the framework. Can include lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and periods.
    - **Image URL**: A publicly accessible URL for an image that is used to identify the framework.
1. Click **Next Step: Create Your Framework**.

Next, add requirements to the framework:

<div class="alert alert-warning">You must add at least one requirement, control, and rule before saving the custom framework.</div>

1. Click **Add Requirement**.
1. Enter the following details:
    - **Requirement**: A requirement acts as a control family, enabling you to add controls and associate rules with each control. Can include lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and periods.
    - **Control**: A control represents the criteria that the requirement must meet and includes the rules associated with these criteria. Multiple rules can be included in a control. Can include lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and periods.
1. Click **Add Rules**.
1. Select the cloud or infrastructure rules you want to assign to the control, then click **Add to Control**.
1. To add additional items:
    - For additional rules, click **Add Rules**.
    - For another control, click **Add Control**.
    - For another requirement, click **Add Requirement**.
1. Click **Save**. Changes can take up to four hours to be reflected in the app.

<div class="alert alert-info">To remove a rule from a control, hover over the rule and click <strong>Remove Rule</strong>.</div>
