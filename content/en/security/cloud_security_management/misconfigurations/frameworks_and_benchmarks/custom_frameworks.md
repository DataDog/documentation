Create your own compliance framework by adding a custom tag to the compliance rules you wish to track. This enables you to filter the misconfigurations on the [Misconfigurations issue explorer][1] by the custom tag. You can also clone the **Cloud Security Management - Misconfigurations Overview** dashboard and [configure a template variable][2] for the custom tag to dynamically filter the widgets on the dashboard.

1. On the **Compliance Rules** page, select the rule you wish to add the custom tag to.
2. Under **Say what's happening**, navigate to the **Tag resulting misconfigurations with** section and add the `key:value` for the custom tag.
3. Click **Update Rule**.

**Notes**:

- `framework`, `requirement`, and `control` are reserved keys and cannot be used in custom tags. See [Custom Rules][3] for more information.
- You can also add custom tags to rules using the [Update an existing rule API endpoint][4].
