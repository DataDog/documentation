  Learn how Datadog Cloud SIEM and Cloud Security elevate your organization's threat detection and investigation for dynamic, cloud-scale environments. 
{{< /learning-center-callout >}}

Datadog Cloud Security delivers deep visibility, continuous configuration audits, identity risk assessments, vulnerability detection, and real-time threat detection across your entire cloud infrastructureâ€”all in a unified platform for seamless collaboration and faster remediation.

Security and DevOps teams can act on the shared context of observability and security data to quickly prioritize and remediate issues.

Cloud Security leverages both the Datadog Agent and Agentless. It includes a variety of features you can enable to manage different facets of your organization's security:

- [**Misconfigurations**][2]: Tracks the security hygiene and compliance posture of your production environment, automates audit evidence collection, and enables you to remediate misconfigurations that leave your organization vulnerable to attacks.
- [**Identity Risks**][8]: Provides in-depth visibility into your organization's AWS IAM, Azure, and GCP risks, and enables you to detect and resolve identity risks on an ongoing basis.
- [**Vulnerabilities**][9]: Continuously detect, prioritize, and remediate exploitable vulnerabilities in your container images, host images, and hosts running in your infrastructure.

## Track your organization's health

Available for [Cloud Security Misconfigurations][2], the [security posture score][5] helps you track your organization's overall health. The score represents the percentage of your environment that satisfies all of your active out-of-the-box cloud and infrastructure compliance rules.

Improve your organization's score by remediating misconfigurations, either by resolving the underlying issue or by muting the misconfiguration.

{{< img src="security/csm/health_scores.png" alt="The posture score on the Cloud Security overview page tracks your organization's overall health" width="100%">}}

## Explore and remediate issues

For an overview of your Cloud Security and App and API Protection findings, sorted by importance, use the [Security Inbox][14].

To get more detail, use [Findings][7] to review and remediate your organization's security findings concerning misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and identity risks. View detailed information about a finding, including guidelines and remediation steps. [Send real-time notifications][6] when a threat is detected in your environment, and use tags to identify the owner of an impacted resource.

## Investigate resources

Use the [Security Graph][17] to model your cloud environment as a relationship graph, so you can visualize and query the connections between your cloud resources. You can write queries to search for specific relationships between resources, such as publicly accessible EC2 instances that can access S3 buckets containing sensitive data, so you can proactively mitigate those infrastructure risks.

<div class="alert alert-warning">Resource Catalog is not supported for your selected <a href="/getting_started/site">Datadog site</a> ({{< region-param key="dd_site_name" >}}).</div>
{{< /site-region >}}

Use the [Resource Catalog][12] to view specific misconfigurations and threats that have been reported on the hosts and resources in your environments. For more information, see the [Resource Catalog][13] documentation.

## Subscribe to weekly digest reports

Receive a weekly summary of Cloud Security activity over the past week, including important new security issues discovered in the last seven days. Subscriptions to the weekly digest report are managed on a per user basis. To [subscribe to the weekly digest report][11], you must have the `security_monitoring_signals_read` permission.

## Learn about emerging threats and vulnerabilities

Use the [Security Research Feed][15] to stay current with the latest security developments, with content managed by Datadog's Security Research and Detection Engineering teams. For more information, see the [Security Research Feed][16] documentation.

## Next steps

To get started with Cloud Security, navigate to the [**Cloud Security Setup**][3] page in Datadog, which has detailed steps on how to set up and configure Cloud Security. For more information, see [Setting Up Cloud Security][10].
