kind: documentation
---

[Datadog Workflow Automation][1] allows you to orchestrate and automate your end-to-end processes by building workflows made up of actions that connect to your infrastructure and tools. 

When combined with [Cloud Security Management (CSM)][2], it enables you to automate your security-related workflows. For example, you can create workflows that allow you to intervene when a [PLACEHOLDER - Slack], or automatically create a Jira ticket when [PLACEHOLDER].

## Trigger a workflow

You can trigger a workflow from the security issue, misconfiguration, and resource side panels.

In the side panel, click **Run Workflow** and select a workflow to run. Depending on the workflow, you may be required to complete additional steps, such as [PLACEHOLDER].

PLACEHOLDER FOR SCREENSHOT

After running the workflow, additional information is shown in the side panel. You can click the link to view the workflow.
