<div class="alert alert-warning">Cloud Security Management is not supported for your selected <a href="/getting_started/site">Datadog site</a> ({{< region-param key="dd_site_name" >}}).</div>
{{< /site-region >}}

<div class="alert alert-info">Cloud Security Management offerings are now available in three separate packages: CSM Enterprise, CSM Pro, and CSM Workload Security. For more information, see <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cloud-security-management-changes/">Changes to Datadog Cloud Security Management</a>.</div>

Cloud Security Management (CSM) delivers real-time threat detection and continuous configuration audits across your entire cloud infrastructure, all in a unified view for seamless collaboration and faster remediation.

You can enable features that aren't included in your package at any time by following the instructions on the [CSM Setup page][4].

CSM is available in three packages: [CSM Enterprise][1], [CSM Pro][2], and [CSM Workload Security][3]. Each package includes access to a specific set of features, as shown in the following table:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Package</th>
        <th>Features</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/security/cloud_security_management/setup/csm_enterprise">CSM Enterprise</a></td>
        <td><ul><li style="font-size:16px"><a href="/security/threats">Threats</a></li><li style="font-size:16px"><a href="/security/misconfigurations">Misconfigurations (cloud accounts and Agent)</a></li><li style="font-size:16px"><a href="/security/identity_risks">Identity Risks</a></li><li style="font-size:16px"><a href="/security/vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities (container images and hosts)</a></li></ul></td>
