Datadog provides a guided workflow for setting up [Cloud Security Management (CSM)][6]. The first step is to select the features you want to enable. After that, follow the instructions provided to configure the selected features.

<div class="alert alert-info">The following instructions apply to new CSM users only. If you're an existing user and would like to enable additional CSM features, see <a href="/security/cloud_security_management/setup/#enable-additional-features">Enable additional features</a>.</div>

1. On the [Intro to Cloud Security Management][10] page, click **Get Started with Cloud Security Management**.
1. On the [Features][11] page, select the features you want to enable.
1. Click **Start Using Cloud Security Management** and confirm your selections.

{{< img src="security/csm/setup/features_selection_new_user.png" alt="CSM Features page" width="100%">}} 

After you confirm your selections, the [Setup][3] page appears. The instructions on the page are customized to match the features you selected. For example, if you enable **Compliance Scanning**, only the **Cloud accounts** and **Hosts and containers** sections are displayed.

The following table shows which sections appear on the Setup page for each feature.

## Enable additional features

You can enable additional CSM features at any time by returning to the [Features][11] page and clicking **Enable** for the features you want to add. This page also serves as a status page that indicates which features are enabled, which features are enabled but not yet configured, and which features are not enabled.
