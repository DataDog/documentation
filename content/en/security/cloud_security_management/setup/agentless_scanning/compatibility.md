**Note**: AMIs must be stored in an account that uses Datadog's AWS integration. Otherwise, Datadog can't read the AMI's underlying Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshot, so it can't scan or report on the AMI.

## Container image registries

The following container image registries are supported for container image scans:

- Amazon ECR public
- Amazon ECR private

**Note**: Container image scanning from registry is only supported if you have installed Agentless with:
  - Cloudformation Integrations >= v2.0.8
  - Terraform Agentless Module >= v0.11.7

## Container runtimes

The following container runtimes are supported:

- containerd: v1.5.6 or later
- Docker

**Note for container observations**: Agentless Scanning requires uncompressed container image layers. As a workaround, you can set the configuration option `discard_unpacked_layers=false` in the containerd configuration file.
