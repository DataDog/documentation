The following instructions enable container image metadata collection and [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)][1] collection in the Datadog Agent for [CSM Vulnerabilities][2]. This allows you to scan the libraries in container images to detect vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are evaluated and and scanned against your containers every hour.

1. Add the following to the `datadog.yaml` configuration file:

    ```yaml
    sbom:
      enabled: true
      container_image:
        enabled: true
    container_image:
      enabled: true
    ```

2. Restart the Agent.
