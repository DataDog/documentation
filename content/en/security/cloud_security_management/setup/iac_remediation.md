## Set up the GitHub integration

Follow [the instructions][3] for creating a GitHub app for your organization.

<div class="alert alert-info">To use IaC remediation, you must give the Github App <code>Read & Write</code> permissions for <code>Contents</code> and <code>Pull Requests</code>. These permissions can be applied to all or select repositories.
</div>
