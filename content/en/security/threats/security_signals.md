[Cloud Security Management Threats][9] (CSM Threats) security signals are created when Datadog detects a threat based on a security rule. View, search, filter, and investigate security signals in the [Signals Explorer][4], or configure [Notification Rules][1] to send signals to third-party tools.

To modify security signals, you must have the `security_monitoring_signals_write` permission. See [Role Based Access Control][3] for more information about Datadog's default roles and granular role-based access control permissions available for Cloud Security Management.

## Filter security signals

To filter the security signals in the [Signals Explorer][4], use the search query `@workflow.triage.state:<status>`, where `<status>` is the state you want to filter on (`open`, `under_review`, or `archived`). You can also use the **Signal State** facet on the facet panel.

## Triage a signal

You can triage a signal by assigning it to a user for further investigation. The assigned user can then track their review by updating the signal's status.

1. On the [Signals Explorer][4], select a security signal.
2. On the signal side panel, click the user profile icon and select a user.
3. To update the status of the security signal, click the triage status dropdown menu and select a status. The default status is **Open**.
    - **Open**: The signal has not yet been resolved.
    - **Under Review**: The signal is actively being investigated. From the **Under Review** state, you can move the signal to **Archived** or **Open** as needed.
    - **Archived**: The detection that caused the signal has been resolved. From the **Archived** state, you can move the signal back to **Open** if it's within 30 days of when the signal was originally detected.

## Create a case

Use [Case Management][6] to track, triage, and investigate security signals.

1. On the [Signals Explorer][4], select a security signal.
2. On the signal side panel, click the **Escalate Investigation** dropdown menu and select **Create a case**. Alternatively, select **Add to an existing case** to add the signal to an existing case. 
3. Enter a title and optional description.
4. Click **Create Case**.

## Declare an incident 

Use [Incident Management][5] to create an incident for a security signal.

1. On the [Signals Explorer][4], select a security signal.
2. On the signal side panel, click the **Escalate Investigation** dropdown menu and select **Declare incident**. Alternatively, select **Add to incident** to add the signal to an existing incident.
3. On the incident creation modal, configure the incident by specifying details such as the severity level and incident commander.
4. Click **Declare Incident**.

## Run a workflow

Use [Workflow Automation][8] to manually trigger a workflow for a security signal. See [Trigger a Workflow from a Security Signal][7] for more information.

1. On the [Signals Explorer][4], select a security signal.
2. On the signal side panel, click the **Workflows** tab.
3. Click **Run Workflow**.
4. On the workflow modal, select the workflow you want to run. Depending on the workflow, you may be required to enter additional input parameters.
5. Click **Run**.
