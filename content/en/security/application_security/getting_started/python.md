You can monitor the security of your Python apps running in Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, and AWS Fargate.

{{% appsec-getstarted %}}

## Get started

1. **Update your Datadog Python library package** to at least version 1.2.2 or later. Run the following:
   ```shell
    pip install --upgrade ddtrace
   ```

   For information about which language and framework versions are supported by the library, see the [Compatibility][1] section of the ASM Setup and Configure documentation.

2. **Enable ASM when starting the Python application**.

   ```bash
   DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true ddtrace-run python app.py
   ```

    You can also use one of the following methods, depending on where your application runs:
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab "Docker CLI" %}}

   Update your configuration container for APM by adding the following argument in your `docker run` command:

   ```shell
   docker run [...] -e DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true [...]
   ```

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab "Dockerfile" %}}

   Add the following environment variable value to your container Dockerfile:

   ```shell
   ENV DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true
   ```

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}

   Update your configuration YAML file container for APM and add the `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED` environment variable:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: <CONTAINER_NAME>
             image: <CONTAINER_IMAGE>/<TAG>
             env:
               - name: DD_APPSEC_ENABLED
                 value: "true"
   ```

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab "AWS ECS" %}}

   Update your ECS task definition JSON file by adding the following in the environment section:

   ```json
   "environment": [
     ...,
     {
       "name": "DD_APPSEC_ENABLED",
       "value": "true"
     }
   ]
   ```

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab "AWS Fargate" %}}

   Initialize ASM in your code or set the `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` in your service invocation:
   ```shell
   DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true ddtrace-run python app.py
   ```

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
