You can detect code-level vulnerabilities and monitor application security in Python applicationss running in Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate.

NOTE: Code-Level Vulnerability detection in Python is currently in beta.

Follow these steps to enable Code Security in your service:

1. [Update your Datadog Agent][6] to at least version 7.41.1.
2. Update your Datadog Tracing Library to at least the minimum version needed to turn on Code Security. For details, see [Library Compatibility][3] page.
3. Add the `DD_IAST_ENABLED=true` environment variable to your application configuration.

   From the command line:

   ```shell
   DD_IAST_ENABLED=true ddtrace-run python app.py
   ```

   Or one of the following methods, depending on where your application runs:


{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker CLI" %}}

Update your configuration container for APM by adding the following argument in your `docker run` command:


```shell
docker run [...] -e DD_IAST_ENABLED=true [...]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Dockerfile" %}}

Add the following environment variable value to your container Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
DD_IAST_ENABLED=true
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}

Update your deployment configuration file for APM and add the IAST environment variable:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <CONTAINER_NAME>
          image: <CONTAINER_IMAGE>/<TAG>
          env:
            - name: DD_IAST_ENABLED
              value: "true"
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Amazon ECS" %}}

Update your ECS task definition JSON file, by adding this in the environment section:

```json
"environment": [
  ...,
  {
    "name": "DD_IAST_ENABLED",
    "value": "true"
  }
]
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

4. Restart your service.
5. To see Code Security in action, browse your service and find code-level vulnerabilities in the [Vulnerability Explorer][4].
