## Prerequisites
Before setting up Code Security, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Datadog Agent Installation:** The Datadog Agent is installed and configured for your application's operating system or container, cloud, or virtual environment.
2. **Datadog APM Configuration:** Datadog APM is configured for your application or service, and web traces (`type:web`) are being received by Datadog.
3. **Supported Tracing Library:** The Datadog Tracing Library used by your application or service supports Code Security capabilities for the language of your application or service. For more details, refer to the [Library Compatibility][1] page.

## Using Datadog Tracing Libraries

Select your application language for details on how to enable Code Security for your language and infrastructure types.
