You can monitor application security for Go apps running in Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS ECS.

{{% appsec-getstarted %}}
- One of the [supported APM tracing integrations][1].
- [CGO][2] is enabled in your build environment, along with the C library headers and the C toolchain for your compilation target. For detailed instructions, see [Enabling CGO][3]

## Get started

1. **Update your program's dependencies** with the latest version of the Datadog Go library (version 1.36.0 or later):

   ```console
   $ go get -v -u gopkg.in/DataDog/dd-trace-go.v1
   ```
   For information about which language and framework versions are supported by the library, see [Compatibility][4].

2. **Recompile your program** and enable ASM and CGO:
   ```console
   $ env CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -v -tags appsec my-program
   ```

3. **Redeploy your Go service and enable ASM** by setting the `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:
   ```console
   $ env DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true ./my-program
   ```
   Or one of the following methods, depending on where your application runs:

   {{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker CLI" %}}

Add the following environment variable value to your Docker command line:

```console
$ docker run -e DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true [...]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Dockerfile" %}}

Add the following environment variable value to your application container's Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
ENV DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}

Update your application's deployment configuration file for APM and add the ASM environment variable:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <CONTAINER_NAME>
          image: <CONTAINER_IMAGE>/<TAG>
          env:
            - name: DD_APPSEC_ENABLED
              value: "true"
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "AWS ECS" %}}

Update your application's ECS task definition JSON file, by adding this in the environment section:

```json
"environment": [
  ...,
  {
    "name": "DD_APPSEC_ENABLED",
    "value": "true"
  }
]
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

{{% appsec-getstarted-2 %}}
