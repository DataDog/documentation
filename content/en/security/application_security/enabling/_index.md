Enable your application to [detect and protect against threats][1] targeting your production systems, and to [manage risks][2] in your code and its open source dependencies, using the Datadog library for your application language. You can detect vulnerabilities and threats for apps hosted on a server, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, and (for supported languages) AWS Fargate.

Select your application language for details on how to do these steps for your language and infrastructure types.
