Enable your application to [detect and protect against threats][1] targeting your production systems, and to [manage risks][2] in your code and its open source dependencies, using the Datadog library for your application language. You can detect vulnerabilities and threats for apps hosted on a server, Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, and (for supported languages) AWS Fargate.

## ASM enablement types

There are two main approaches to enable ASM on your tracing libraries: single-step or with Datadog tracing libraries.

### Single-step instrumentation

- [Single Step Instrumentation (Beta)][3]: Run a one-line install command to install the Datadog Agent, enable ASM, and protect all of your services on your Linux host, VM, or containers.

### Datadog tracing libraries

- [Datadog libraries][4]: Use Datadog tracing libraries to add and customize observability within Datadog.
