ASM provides serverless capability for the following platforms and libraries:

## AWS Lambda
**Note**: Threat Protection through Remote Configuration is not supported. Use [Workflows][5] to block IPs in your [WAF][6].

### Supported trigger types
ASM Threat Detection supports HTTP requests as function input only, as that channel has the highest likelihood of attackers exploiting a serverless application. HTTP requests typically come from AWS services such as:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- API Gateway v1 (Rest API)
- API Gateway v2 (HTTP API)
- Function URL

### Additional language specific compatibility information

Node.js
: If you are bundling using webpack or esbuild, [follow the specific bundler instructions][4].

Python
: 

Java
: To fully instrument your serverless application with distributed tracing, your Java Lambda functions must use the Java 8 Corretto (`java8.al2`), Java 11 (`java11`) or Java 17 (`java17`) runtimes with at least 1024MB of memory.
: If you use the Datadog Lambda layers `dd-trace-java:4` (or older) and `Datadog-Extension:24` (or older), follow the instructions in [Upgrade Instrumentation for Java Lambda Functions][3].

Go
: 

.NET
: 


## Google Cloud Run

**Note**: Threat Protection through Remote Configuration is not supported. Use [Workflows][5] to block IPs in your [WAF][6].

## Azure App Service

Only *web applications* are supported. Azure Functions are not supported with ASM.

**Note**: Threat Protection through Remote Configuration is not supported. Use [Workflows][5] to block IPs in your [WAF][6].
