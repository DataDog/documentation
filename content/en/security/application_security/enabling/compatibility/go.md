## Language and framework compatibility

### Supported Go versions

The Datadog Go tracing library supports Go version 1.14 and greater, on the following architectures:
- Linux (GNU) x86-64
- Alpine Linux (musl) x86-64
- macOS (Darwin) x86-64

You can monitor application security for Go apps running in Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS ECS.

### Supported frameworks

Integrate the Go tracer with the following list of web frameworks using one of the corresponding APM tracer integrations. Refer to [Go's integrations documentation][1] for a detailed overview of the supported packages and their APIs, along with usage examples.

- [gRPC][2]
- [net/http][3]
- [Gorilla Mux][4]
- [Echo][5]
- [Chi][6]
- [HttpRouter][7]

### Enabling CGO

Compiling your code with ASM enabled involves [CGO][8] and therefore requires:

- The `gcc` compiler for the target `GOOS` and `GOARCH`.
- The C library headers.
- The CGO bindings enabled. This is controlled by the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable which is enabled by default when compiling natively.

To install the above requirements:

| Operating system     | Console command |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Debian, Ubuntu       | `$ apt install gcc libc6-dev`   |
| Alpine               | `$ apk add gcc musl-dev`        |
| RHEL, CentOS, Fedora | `$ yum install gcc glibc-devel` |
| macOS                | `$ xcode-select --install`      |

**Note**: The Go toolchain disables CGO when cross-compiling and so, CGO needs to be explicitly enabled.


## ASM capabilities support

The following ASM capabilities are supported in the Go library, for the specified tracer version:

| ASM capability                   | Minimum Go tracer version |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------|
| Threat Detection <br/> --> Business logic API  | 1.47.0 <br/>  |
| Threat Protection <br/> --> IP blocking <br/> --> Suspicious request blocking <br> --> User blocking   |  <br/> --> 1.48.0<br/> --> v1.50.0<br/> --> 1.48.0     |
| Risk Management <br/> --> Third-party vulnerability detection <br/> --> Custom code vulnerability detection | not supported<br/><br/> |

The minimum tracer version to get all supported ASM capabilities for Go is 1.48.0.

**Note**: Threat Protection requires enabling [Remote Configuration][10], which is included in the listed minimum tracer version.
