## Language and framework compatibility

The Datadog PHP library supports PHP version 7.0 and above on the following architectures:

- Linux (GNU) x86-64
- Alpine Linux (musl) x86-64

You can monitor application security for PHP apps running in Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS ECS.

The library supports the use of all PHP frameworks, and also the use of no framework.


## ASM capabilities support

The following ASM capabilities are supported in the PHP library, for the specified tracer version:

| ASM capability                   | Minimum PHP tracer version |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------|
| Threat Detection <br/> --> Business logic API  | 0.84.0 <br/>   |
| Threat Protection <br/> --> IP blocking <br/> --> Suspicious request blocking <br> --> User blocking   | 0.86.0<br/><br/><br/>     |
| Vulnerability Management <br/> --> Open source vulnerability detection <br/> --> Custom code vulnerability detection | not supported<br/><br/> |

The minimum tracer version to get all supported ASM capabilities for PHP is 0.86.0.

**Note**: Threat Protection requires enabling [Remote Configuration][2], which is included in the listed minimum tracer version.
