## Data security considerations

The data that you collect with Datadog can contain sensitive information that you want to filter out, obfuscate, scrub, filter, modify, or just not collect. Additionally, it may contain synthetic traffic that might cause your threat detection be inaccurate, or cause Datadog to not accurately indicate the security of your services.
