## Overview

If your service is running [an Agent with Remote Configuration enabled and a tracing library version that supports it][2], you can block attacks and attackers from the Datadog UI without additional configuration of the Agent or tracing libraries.

Application Security Management (ASM) Protect enables you to slow down attacks and attackers by _blocking_ them. Security traces are blocked in real-time by the Datadog tracing libraries. Blocks are saved in the Datadog platform, automatically and securely fetched by the Datadog Agent, deployed in your infrastructure, and applied to your services.

## Prerequisites 

To leveraging protection capabilities for your service:

- [Update your Datadog Agent][3] to at least version 7.41.1.
- [Enable ASM][1].
- [Enable Remote Configuration][2].
- Update your tracing library to at least the minimum version needed to turn on protection. For details, see the ASM capabilities support section of [Compatibility][12] for your service's language.
- If you plan to use authenticated user blocking, [add user information to traces][4].

## Blocking attackers (IPs and authenticated users)

You can block attackers that are flagged in ASM [Security Signals][5] temporarily or permanently. In the Signals Explorer, click into a signal to see what users and IP addresses are generating the signal, and optionally block them.

From there, all ASM-protected services block incoming requests performed by the blocked IP or user, for the specified duration. All blocked traces are tagged with `security_response.block_ip` or `security_response.block_user` and displayed in the [Trace Explorer][6]. Services where ASM is disabled aren't protected. See [Investigate Security Signals][20] for more information.

## Respond to threats in real time by automating attacker blocking

In addition to manually blocking attackers, you can configure automation rules to have ASM automatically block attackers that are flagged in Security Signals. 

To get started, navigate to **Security > Application Security > Configuration > [Detection Rules][14]**. You can create a new rule or edit an existing rule with type _Application security_. For example, you can create a rule to trigger `Critical` severity signals when Credential Stuffing attacks are detected, and automatically block the associated attackers' IP addresses for 30 minutes.

**Note**: You must instrument your services to be able to block authenticated attackers. See [User Monitoring and Protection][15] for more details.

## Block attackers at the perimeter - integrate ASM with your existing WAF deployments

Datadog ASM enables customers to block attackers at the perimeter, directly from the Security Signal. ASM integrates with [Workflows][17] to push the attackers' IP addresses to perimeter Web Application Firewalls (AWS WAF, Cloudflare, Fastly) and ensure requests from these attackers are blocked at the edge even before they enter the customer's environment.
Create workflows from the available [blueprints][18] and run them directly from ASM's Signal side panel.

## Denylist

Attackers' IP addresses and authenticated users that are permanently or temporarily blocked are added to the _Denylist_. Manage the list on the [Denylist page][7]. A denylist supports blocking individual IPs as well as a range of IPs (CIDR blocks).

## Passlist

You can use the _Passlist_ to permanently allow specific IP addresses access to your application. For example, you may wish to add internal IP addresses to your passlist, or IP addresses that regularly run security audits on your application. You can also add specific paths to ensure uninterrupted access. Manage the list from the [Passlist page][8].

## Blocking attack attempts with In-App WAF

ASM In-App WAF (web application firewall) combines the detection techniques of perimeter-based WAFs with the rich context provided by Datadog, helping your teams protect their systems with confidence.

Because ASM is aware of an application's routes, protection can be applied granularly to specific services, and not necessarily across all applications and traffic. This contextual efficiency reduces your inspection effort, and it reduces the false positive rate compared to a perimeter WAF. There is no learning period, because most web frameworks provide a structured map of routes. ASM can help your team roll out protections against zero-day vulnerabilities automatically soon after the vulnerability is disclosed, while targeting vulnerable applications, limiting the risk of false positives.

### How In-App WAF blocks security traces

In addition to the `monitoring` and `disabled` modes offered for each of the 130+ In-App WAF rules, rules also have `blocking` mode. Each rule specifies conditions on the incoming request to define what the library considers suspicious. When a given rule pattern matches an ongoing HTTP request, the request is blocked by the library. 

Managed policies define the mode in which each of the In-App WAF rules behave on match: `monitoring`, `blocking`, or `disabled`. Because it has the full context of your applications, ASM knows which rules to apply to protect your applications while limiting the number of false positives. 

For fine-grained control, you can clone a Datadog managed policy or create a custom policy and set the mode to meet your needs. If you set the policy to `auto-updating`, your applications are protected by the latest detections rolled out by Datadog. You also have the option to pin a policy to a specific version of the ruleset. 

As In-App WAF rules are toggled between modes, the changes are reflected in near real-time for services with [Remote Configuration enabled][2]. For other services, you can update the policy on the [In-App WAF page][9] and then [define In-App WAF rules][10] for the change in behavior to be applied.

Manage In-App WAF by navigating to Security --> Application Security --> Configuration --> [In-App WAF][9].

View blocked security traces in the [Trace Explorer][11] by filtering on the facet `Blocked:true`.

### Configure In-App WAF

1. [**Enable Remote Configuration**][2] so that your ASM-enabled services show up under In-App WAF. This is required to securely push In-App WAF configuration from your Datadog backend to the tracing library in your infrastructure. 

2. **Associate your ASM/Remote Configuration-enabled services with a policy**. After Remote Configuration is enabled on a service, it appears under the _Datadog Recommended_ policy by default. Datadog Recommended is a managed policy and is read-only, meaning you cannot modify the status (monitoring, blocking, or disabled) for individual rules.

   If you need granular control, clone the _Datadog Recommended_ policy to create a custom policy where rule statuses can be modified. Associate one or more of your services with this custom policy.

3. **Configure blocking for each service**. By default, no requests are blocked even if certain In-App WAF rule statuses are blocking. Navigate to **Security > Configuration > Application > [In-App WAF][13]** to turn on blocking mode for a service. See [In-app WAF rules][19] for more information.

## Customize protection behavior

### Customize response to blocked requests

{{% asm-protection-page-configuration %}}

{{< img src="/security/application_security/asm-blocking-page-html.png" alt="The page displayed as ASM blocks requests originating from blocked IPs" width="75%" >}}

The default HTTP response status code while serving the deny page to attackers is `403 FORBIDDEN`. To customize the response, navigate to **Security > Application Security > Configuration > [Protection][16]**.

You can optionally mask the fact that the attacker has been detected and blocked by overriding the response code to be `200 OK` or `404 NOT FOUND` when the deny page is served.

You can also optionally redirect attackers to a custom deny page and away from your critical services and infrastructure. Specify a redirect URL and the type of redirect, for example permanent (`301` response code) or temporary (`302` response code). 

### Disable protection across all services (Disabling protection mode)

Protection mode is **on** by default and is a toggle available to quickly disable blocking across **all** your services. Requests can be blocked from two sections in Datadog: all attacker requests from Security Signals, and security traces from In-App WAF. The latter also requires you to configure blocking per service in In-App WAF. 

As important as it is for you to be able to apply protection granularly and reduce the likelihood of legitimate users getting blocked, you sometimes need a simple off switch to quickly stop **all** blocking across **all** services. To turn off protection, navigate to **Security > Application Security > Configuration > [Protection][16]** and toggle **Protection mode** to off.
