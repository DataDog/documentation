## Prerequisites 

Before setting up Application & API Protection, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- **Datadog Agent:** [Install the Datadog Agent][2] and configure it for your application's operating system or container, cloud, or virtual environment.
- **Datadog APM Configuration:** Datadog APM is configured for your application or service, and web traces (`type:web`) are being received by Datadog.
- **Supported Tracing Library:** The Datadog Tracing Library used by your application or service supports Application & API Protection capabilities for the language of your application or service. For more details, refer to the [Library Compatibility][1] page.

## Using AAP without APM tracing

If you want to use Application & API Protection without APM tracing functionality, you can deploy with tracing disabled:

1. Configure your tracing library with the `DD_APM_TRACING_ENABLED=false` environment variable in addition to the `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true` environment variable.
2. This configuration will reduce the amount of APM data sent to Datadog to the minimum required by Application Security products.

For more details, see [Standalone Application Security][3].

## Language-specific configuration

Select your application language for details on how to enable Application & API Protection for your language and infrastructure types.
