The Datadog nginx tracing module has experimental support for threat detection and blocking.

## Enabling threat detection
### Get started

1. Verify that your nginx build was compiled with the flag
   `--with-threads`. Most distributions ship with this flag enabled by default.
   To check if your nginx installation was built with thread support, run `nginx
   -V` and check the `configure arguments` line. If you cannot find
   `--with-threads` in the output, you will need to rebuild nginx with this flag
   enabled. For more information on how to build nginx from sources, see the
   [nginx documentation][3].

2. **Update your nginx tracing library module** to at least version 1.2.0. Visit
   the [GitHub releases page][2] and select the artifact named according to the
   pattern "ngx_http_datadog_module-appsec-&lt;amd64/arm64&gt;-&lt;nginx
   version&gt;.so.tgz". Note that this artifact includes "appsec" in the name.

3. **Enable ASM in the nginx configuration**.
   You need to:
   * define one or more thread pools with the [`thread_pool`][4] directive,
   * explicitly enable AppSec with [`datadog_appsec_enabled`][5], and
   * map requests to a thread pool or pools that you defined with the directive
     [`datadog_waf_thread_pool_name`][6].

   For example:

   ```nginx
   load_module /path/to/ngx_http_datadog_module.so;
   thread_pool waf_thread_pool threads=4 max_queue=128;
   http {
     datadog_appsec_enabled on;
     datadog_waf_thread_pool_name waf_thread_pool;
   }
   ```

   For more information, see the [reference documentation][3].

## Limitations

As of version 1.3.0, the available functionality has the following important limitations:

* The request body is not inspected, regardless of its content type.

* It's not possible to block the request based on characteristics of the
  response, such as its status code, headers, or body.
