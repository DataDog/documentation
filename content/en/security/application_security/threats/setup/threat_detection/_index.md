## Prerequisites 

Before setting up Threat Management, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- **Datadog Agent Installation:** The Datadog Agent is installed and configured for your application's operating system or container, cloud, or virtual environment.
- **Datadog APM Configuration:** Datadog APM is configured for your application or service, and web traces (`type:web`) are being received by Datadog.
- **Supported Tracing Library:** The Datadog Tracing Library used by your application or service supports Threat Management capabilities for the language of your application or service. For more details, refer to the [Library Compatibility][1] page.

Select your application language for details on how to enable ASM Threat Detection for your language and infrastructure types.
