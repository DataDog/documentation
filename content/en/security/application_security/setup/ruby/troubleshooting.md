title: Troubleshooting Ruby App and API Protection

## Common Issues

### No security signals appearing

1. **Verify Agent version**
   - Ensure you're running Datadog Agent v7.41.1 or higher
   - Check Agent status: `datadog-agent status`

2. **Check Ruby tracer version**
   - Confirm you're using Ruby tracer v1.9.0 or higher

3. **Verify configuration or environment variables**

#### When using auto-instrumentation

- Ensure that `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED` is set to `true`
- Check `DD_SERVICE` and `DD_ENV` are properly configured
- Set `DD_AGENT_HOST` and `DD_AGENT_PORT` if agent is running on a different host or port
- Check that `DD_SERVICE` and `DD_ENV` are properly configured
- Verify `DD_APM_ENABLED=true` if using APM features

#### When using configuration file

- Ensure that `c.appsec.enabled` is set to `true` in your configuration
- Ensure that `c.tracing.instrument :rails` and `c.appsec.instrument :rails` is added to your configuration
- Check that `c.service` is set
- Verify that `c.tracing.enabled` is set to `true` if using APM features

### Performance impact

1. **High latency**
   - Check Agent resource usage
   - Verify network connectivity between Agent and Datadog
   - Consider adjusting sampling rates

2. **High memory usage**
   - Adjust Agent resource limits if needed

If you suspect performance issues with the Ruby tracer, please create an issue in the [Datadog Ruby tracer GitHub repository][4] with details about your environment and the issue you're facing.
