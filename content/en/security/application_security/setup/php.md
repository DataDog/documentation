You can monitor App and API Protection for PHP apps running in host-based or container-based environments such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, and AWS EKS.

## Enabling threat detection
### Get started

1. **Install the latest Datadog PHP library** by downloading and running the installer:
   ```shell
   wget https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/latest/download/datadog-setup.php -O datadog-setup.php
   php datadog-setup.php --php-bin all --enable-appsec
   ```
   To check that your service's language and framework versions are supported for AAP capabilities, see [Compatibility][1].

2. **Enable the library in your code** by restarting PHP-FPM or Apache. In a containerized environment, if you previously installed the library without enabling AAP, you can optionally enable it after by setting the following environment variable:
   {{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Docker CLI" %}}

Update your configuration container for APM by adding the following argument in your `docker run` command:

```shell
docker run [...] -e DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true [...]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Dockerfile" %}}

Add the following environment variable value to your container Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
ENV DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}

Update your configuration yaml file container for APM and add the AppSec env variable:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: <CONTAINER_NAME>
          image: <CONTAINER_IMAGE>/<TAG>
          env:
            - name: DD_APPSEC_ENABLED
              value: "true"
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "AWS ECS" %}}

Update your ECS task definition JSON file, by adding this in the environment section:

```json
"environment": [
  ...,
  {
    "name": "DD_APPSEC_ENABLED",
    "value": "true"
  }
]
```

{{% /tab %}}

## Using AAP without APM tracing

If you want to use Application & API Protection without APM tracing functionality, you can deploy with tracing disabled:

1. Configure your tracing library with the `DD_APM_TRACING_ENABLED=false` environment variable in addition to the `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true` environment variable.
2. This configuration will reduce the amount of APM data sent to Datadog to the minimum required by App and API Protection products.
