title: Troubleshooting .NET App and API Protection
---

## Common Issues

### No security signals appearing

1. Verify Agent version:
   - Ensure you're running Datadog Agent v7.41.1 or higher.
   - Check Agent status: `datadog-agent status`.
2. Check .NET tracer version:
   - Confirm you're using .NET tracer v2.42.0 or higher.
3. Verify environment variables:
   - Ensure `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true` is set.
   - Check `DD_SERVICE` and `DD_ENV` are properly configured.
   - Verify `DD_APM_ENABLED=true` if using APM features.
4. Check file system permissions:
   - Ensure the application has write access to `/tmp`.
   - Verify the Java agent JAR is readable.

### Application fails to start

1. Check logs for errors:
   - Logs are located at `/var/log/datadog/dotnet/`

### Performance impact

1. High latency:
   - Check Agent resource usage.
   - Verify network connectivity between Agent and Datadog.
   - Consider adjusting sampling rates.
2. High memory usage:
   - Monitor memory usage.
   - Adjust Agent resource limits if needed
