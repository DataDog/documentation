App and API Protection integrates with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) by:

1. Converting logs to traces to gain visibility into monitored and blocked requests
2. Blocking IP addresses with AWS WAF IPsets

Both can be set up independently, but it is recommended to first set up the conversion of logs to traces in order to inspect the AWS WAF actions.

## Prerequisites

 - The [Amazon Web Services integration][1] is setup.
 - Metrics, and Logs collection are enabled on the [AWS WAF integration][2]. 
 - A [Connection][3] is created with the AWS account hosting the AWS WAF used for blocking.

## Convert AWS WAF logs to traces

First, **enable** the conversion of logs to traces on the [Settings page][4]. 

Then, ensure the web ACLs table contains request metrics as well as logs and traces.

Security traces are reported in the [AAP Traces Explorer][5] with service name `aws.waf`.

## Block with AWS WAF IPsets 

To block attackers, Datadog needs to manage a dedicated IPset. This IPset must be referenced by the web ACL with a rule in blocking mode.

Multiple web ACLs can be set up in the same or in different AWS accounts. In this case, a [Connection][3] must be created per AWS account.

Ensure the AWS role attached to the [Connection][3] has the following permissions:

 - `GetIPSet`
 - `UpdateIPSet`

1. Edit your Terraform configuration with the following content:
   ```tf
   resource "aws_wafv2_ip_set" "Datadog-blocked-ipv4s" {
     name               = "Datadog-blocked-ipv4s"
     ip_address_version = "IPV4"
     scope              = "CLOUDFRONT"
     addresses          = []
   
     lifecycle {
       # The addresses are managed by the Datadog Application Security product.
       ignore_changes = [addresses]
     }
   }
   
   # Add a blocking rule to your existing web ACL resource
   resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl" "EdgeWAF" {
     name  = "EdgeWAF"
     description = "undefined"
     scope = "CLOUDFRONT"
   
     default_action {
       allow {}
     }
   
     rule {
       name     = "BlockedIPs"
       priority = 0
   
       action {
         block {}
       }
   
       statement {
         ip_set_reference_statement {
           arn = aws_wafv2_ip_set."Datadog-blocked-ipv4s".arn
         }
       }
   
       visibility_config {
         cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
         metric_name                = "Datadog-blocked-ipv4s"
         sampled_requests_enabled   = true
       }
     }
   
     visibility_config {
       cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
       metric_name                = "EdgeWAF"
       sampled_requests_enabled   = true
     }
   }
   ```

2. Run `terraform apply` to create/update the WAF resources.

Finally, once setup is complete, click **Block New Attackers** on the App & API Protection [denylist page][6]. Select the web ACL and associated AWS connection to block IP addresses.
