title: Troubleshooting Node.js App and API Protection
---

## Common Issues

### No security signals appearing

If you don't see AAP threat information in the [Trace and Signals Explorer][1] for your Node.js application, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Verify Agent version**
   - Ensure you're running Datadog Agent v7.41.1 or higher
   - Check Agent status: `datadog-agent status`

2. **Check Node.js tracer version**
   - Confirm you're using Node.js tracer v4.30.0 or higher
   - Verify the tracer is loaded: `node -e "console.log(require('dd-trace/package.json').version)"`

3. **Verify environment variables**
   - Ensure `DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true` is set
   - Check `DD_SERVICE` and `DD_ENV` are properly configured
   - Verify `DD_APM_ENABLED=true` if using APM features

4. **Check tracer initialization**
   - Ensure `dd-trace/init` is required at the start of your application
   - Verify the tracer is properly loaded before your application code

### Application fails to start

1. **Check Node.js version compatibility**
   - Ensure you're using a supported Node.js version (see [compatibility requirements][2])
   - Verify Node.js version: `node --version`

2. **Check dd-trace installation**
   - Ensure `dd-trace` is properly installed: `npm list dd-trace`
   - Reinstall if necessary: `npm install dd-trace`

3. **Module loading errors**
   - Check for conflicts with other tracing libraries
   - Verify the tracer is required before other modules

### Performance impact

1. **High latency**
   - Check Agent resource usage
   - Verify network connectivity between Agent and Datadog
   - Consider adjusting sampling rates
   - Review [performance considerations][3]

2. **High memory usage**
   - Monitor Node.js process memory usage
   - Check for memory leaks in your application
   - Consider adjusting tracer configuration

### Configuration issues

1. **Environment variables not recognized**
   - Ensure environment variables are set before starting the application
   - Check for typos in environment variable names
   - Verify that the tracer is initialized with the correct configuration

2. **Tracer initialization problems**
   - Make sure `require('dd-trace/init')` is the first line in your application
   - Check for syntax errors in your tracer configuration
   - Verify that the tracer is being imported correctly

### Still having issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:
1. Check the [Application Security Monitoring troubleshooting guide][1]
2. Review the [Node.js tracer documentation][4]
3. Enable debug logging: `DD_TRACE_DEBUG=true`
4. Contact [Datadog support][5]
