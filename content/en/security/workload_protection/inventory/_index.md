Actively improve security posture and workload resilience using the Workload Protection [Inventory][1].

The **Inventory** section gives DevSecOps teams a unified, real-time view of workload security posture across all compute environments: hosts, containers, and serverless functions. It consolidates asset visibility, protection coverage, and actionable insights so you can identify and remediate gaps before they become exploitable risks.

Inventory is organized into the following features:

- [Hosts & Containers][1]:
  * List all physical and virtual hosts and container workloads
  * Filter by policy, rule status, agent version, and health
  * Identify unprotected or misconfigured workloads
- [Serverless][2]:
  * Track coverage for serverless functions
  * Confirm policy enforcement on event-driven workloads
  * Spot coverage gaps as functions are deployed or updated
- [Coverage Map][3]:
  * View a real-time map of workload protection status
  * Find and prioritize workloads in a warning state
  * Filter by policy, rule, or MITRE ATT\&CK tactic to locate gaps
  * Check for outdated or unhealthy agents

## Benefits of using Inventory for posture management

- Proactive risk reduction: Spot and fix gaps before attackers can exploit them.
- Faster incident response: Pivot from high-level coverage views to specific assets or policies in seconds.
- Continuous compliance: Maintain alignment with regulatory and internal security requirements.
- Cloud-native scalability: Coverage updates in under 5 minutes keep up with rapidly changing environments.
