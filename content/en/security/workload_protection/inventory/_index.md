The [Workload Protection Inventory][1] tools give security teams a unified, real-time view of workload security posture across all compute environments: hosts, containers, and serverless functions. **Inventory** consolidates asset visibility, protection coverage, and actionable insights so you can identify and remediate gaps before they become exploitable risks.

Inventory is organized into the following tools:

- [Hosts & Containers][1]:
  * List all physical and virtual hosts and container workloads.
  * Filter by environment, enabled features, agent version, and more
- [Serverless][2]:
  * Track coverage for serverless functions
  * Filter by environment, enabled features, agent version, and more
- [Coverage Map][3]:
  * View a map of Workload Protection status updated every 1-5 minutes
  * Find and prioritize workloads in a warning state
  * Filter by policy, rule, or MITRE ATT&CK tactic to locate gaps
  * Check for outdated or unhealthy agents

## Key benefits

- **Proactive risk reduction:** Spot and fix gaps before attackers can exploit them.
- **Faster incident response:** Pivot from high-level coverage views to specific assets or policies in seconds.
- **Continuous compliance:** Maintain alignment with regulatory and internal security requirements.
- **Cloud-native scalability:** Coverage updates in under 5 minutes keep up with rapidly changing environments.
