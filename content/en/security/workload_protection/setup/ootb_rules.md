title: OOTB Rules
---

Datadog provides out-of-the-box (OOTB) threat detection rules to flag attacker techniques so you can immediately take steps to remediate. Datadog continuously develops new default rules, which are automatically imported into your account, your Workload Protection library, and the Agent, depending on your configuration.

For a list of all of the OOTB Workload Protection rules, see the Workload Protection button in the [OOTB Rules in the Security Overview][1].
