## Overview

Datadog [Infrastructure Vulnerability Management][1] combines infrastructure observability with security insights to detect, prioritize, and manage vulnerabilities in your organization. It scans for vulnerabilities in the [container images][2] and [hosts][4] in your infrastructure.

## Review the health of your container images
Infrastructure Vulnerability Management offers vulnerabilities in the Container Images on your hosts.

- View your container images on the [container images][2] page. 
- Observe the number of vulnerabilities that exist in the container images (column name `VULNERABILITIES`).

View additional details about any vulnerability by clicking the container image and reviewing the **Vulnerabilities** tab:

## Identify impacted infrastructure

- Click any vulnerability to see more information. 
- Click **View Vulnerability in CSM** to view all related infrastructure impacted by this vulnerability:

This opens the CSM [Vulnerabilities][1] explorer which includes information about: 

- A description of the vulnerability.
- The date on which the vulnerability was last detected.
- Recommended remediation steps.
- Affected container images and hosts.

## Review and remediate

View a consolidated list of all vulnerabilities within the [Vulnerabilities][1] explorer in [Cloud Security Management][3]. Prioritize them for remediation using available facets, such as context-based **severity**, **resource type**, and **library**. Additionally, you can sort vulnerabilities by **registry image**, **host**, **environment**, and more.
