## Overview

Datadog [Infrastructure Vulnerability Management][1] leverages infrastructure observability to detect, prioritize, and manage vulnerabilities in your organization. Infrastructure Vulnerability Management offers visibility into the vulnerabilities in the [Container Images][2] and hosts in your infrastructure.

## Review the health of your container images
Infrastructure Vulnerability Management offers vulnerabilities in the Container Images on your hosts.

- View your container images on the [Container Images][2] page. 
- Sort images by the number of active containers (column name `CONTAINERS`).
- Observe the number of vulnerabilities that exist in the container image (column name `VULNERABILITIES`).

View additional details about any vulnerability by clicking on the container image and reviewing the **Vulnerabilities** tab:

This opens a panel which includes information about: 

- A description of the vulnerability.
- The date on which the vulnerability was last detected.
- Recommended remediation steps.
- Affected container images and hosts.

## Identify top container and host-based vulnerabilities

View a consolidated list of all vulnerabilities on the [Vulnerabilities][1] page in [Cloud Security Management][3]. Prioritize them for remediation based on severity, resource type and vulnerability source. Additionally you can sort vulnerabilities by library, registry image, host, environment, and more.
