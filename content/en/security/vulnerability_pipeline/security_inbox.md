title: Security Inbox Rules
---

Configure inbox rules to manage your Security Inbox effectively, ensuring only the most relevant security issues are highlighted. By customizing conditions, you can focus on critical concerns, prioritize key risks, support compliance, and bring attention to issues that might otherwise be overlooked.

## Create an inbox rule

1. On the [Vulnerability Pipeline][2] page, click **Add a New Rule** and select **Add to Security Inbox**.
1. Use the following boxes to configure the rule criteria:
    - **Any of these types**: The types of findings that the rule should check for. Available types include **Misconfiguration**, **Attack Path**, and **Identity Risk**.
    - **Any of these rules**: The detection rules that must match for the rule to apply.
    - **Any tags or attributes**: The resource tags or attributes that must match for the rule to apply.
1. To add severities or frameworks to the rule, click **Add severity** or **Add framework**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in the **Rule Name** box and click **Save**.

## Manage rule matching order

When Datadog identifies a vulnerability, it evaluates the vulnerability against your sequence of inbox rules. Starting with the first rule, if there's a match, Datadog adds the vulnerability to the Security Inbox and stops evaluating further. If no match occurs, Datadog moves to the next rule. This process continues until a match is found or all rules are checked without a match.
