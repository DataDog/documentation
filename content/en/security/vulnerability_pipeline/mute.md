title: Mute Rules
---

Configure mute rules to streamline security alerts by automatically filtering out non-urgent findings. This approach helps reduce noise from known false positives and accepted risks, allowing you to focus on addressing the most critical threats.

## Create a mute rule

1. On the [Vulnerability Pipeline][2] page, click **Add a New Rule** and select **Mute**.
1. Use the following boxes to configure the rule criteria:
    - **Any of these types**: The types of findings that the rule should check for. Available types include **Misconfiguration**, **Attack Path**, and **Identity Risk**.
    - **Any of these rules**: The detection rules that must match for the rule to apply.
    - **Any tags or attributes**: The resource tags or attributes that must match for the rule to apply.
1. To add severities or frameworks to the rule, click **Add severity** or **Add framework**.
1. Use the following boxes to specify the mute reason and duration:
    - **Select a reason for muting**: The reason for muting the finding. Available reasons include **Duplicate**, **External solution**, **False positive**, **Internal solution**, **No fix available**, **Accepted risk**, and **Other**.
    - **Select the rule expiration**: The date on which the rule expires. 
    - **Add further description for muting reason**: Optional box for including additional muting reason details.
1.  Enter a descriptive name for the rule in the **Rule Name** box and click **Save**.

## Manage rule matching order

When Datadog identifies a vulnerability, it evaluates the vulnerability against your sequence of mute rules. Starting with the first rule, if there's a match, Datadog mutes the vulnerability for the specified duration and stops evaluating further. If no match occurs, Datadog moves to the next rule. This process continues until a match is found or all rules are checked without a match.
