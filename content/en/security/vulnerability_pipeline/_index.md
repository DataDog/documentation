title: Vulnerability Pipeline
---

Vulnerability Pipeline streamlines the management of security risks by allowing you to set up automated rules for newly discovered vulnerabilities, thus accelerating triage and remediation efforts at scale.

## Availability

Vulnerability Pipeline is available for:

- Misconfigurations
- Attack paths
- Identity risks
- Vulnerabilities

## How it works

Vulnerability Pipeline operates through a rules-based system that allows you to automate how new vulnerabilities are managed. Here's how it works:

- **Rule configuration**: Each rule consists of multiple criteria, designed to filter vulnerabilities based on specific attributes. Within a rule, the combination of these criteria operates as a logical AND; however, if any criteria include multiple values, those values operate as a logical OR. This structure gives you the flexibility to create rules that precisely target your needs.
- **Rule matching**: Vulnerability Pipeline evaluates vulnerabilities against your rules in the order you've listed them. As each vulnerability is processed, it moves through the list until it finds a matching rule, at which point the specified action—such as muting non-urgent issues or highlighting critical threats—is triggered.

## Use cases

### Mute non-urgent findings so you can prioritize immediate threats

Mitigate information overload by muting non-urgent findings, enabling you to focus on critical threats. This allows you to:

- **Proactively discard non-urgent findings**: Automatically filter out known scenarios that don't require immediate action, such as false positives or accepted risks, without manual intervention.
- **Focus on true risks**: Prioritize and address genuine threats, ensuring your attention is directed towards remediating real and pressing issues.
- **Streamline security alerts**: Avoid distractions from security alerts by eliminating noise related to:
  - Known false positives
  - Resources deemed non-critical or unimportant
  - Intentional vulnerabilities in controlled environments
  - Ephemeral resources that naturally flag without posing long-term concerns

### Customize the Security Inbox to highlight what's important to your organization

Customize your Security Inbox by defining specific conditions that determine which security issues are highlighted. This allows you to:

- **Resurface issues not captured by default**: Highlight issues that might be missed by default or custom detection rules, ensuring no critical issue is overlooked.
- **Strengthen compliance and address key system concerns**: Address concerns affecting regulatory compliance or important business systems, regardless of severity.
- **Prioritize current risks**: Focus on immediate threats, such as identity risks after an incident or industry-wide vulnerabilities.
