## How it works

First match applies

Ordering of query rules is a layered approach where a vulnerability is cast against each rule until it matches one of them (this applies to muting and security inbox).

Each rule criteria is a logical AND, but if a criteria has more than one value, those are logical ORs.

## Use cases

### Mute non-urgent findings so you can prioritize immediate threats

Mitigate information overload by muting non-urgent findings, enabling you to focus on critical threats. This feature allows you to:

- **Proactively discard non-urgent findings**: Automatically filter out known scenarios that don't require immediate action, such as false positives or accepted risks, without manual intervention.
- **Focus on true risks**: Prioritize and address genuine threats, ensuring your attention is directed towards remediating real and pressing issues.
- **Streamline security alerts**: Avoid distractions from security alerts by eliminating noise related to:
  - Known false positives, reducing unnecessary investigations.
  - Resources deemed non-critical or unimportant, saving time and effort.
  - Intentional vulnerabilities in controlled environments, preventing alarms where risks have been accepted.
  - Ephemeral resources, where temporary systems or processes might naturally flag without posing long-term concerns.

### Customize your Security Inbox to highlight only what's important

Customize your Security Inbox by defining specific conditions that determine which security issues are highlighted. This allows you to:

- **Resurface issues not captured by default**: Highlight issues that might be missed by default or custom detection rules, ensuring no critical issue is overlooked.
- **Strengthen compliance and address key system concerns**: Address concerns affecting regulatory compliance or important business systems, regardless of severity.
- **Prioritize current risks**: Focus on immediate threats, such as identity risks after an incident or industry-wide vulnerabilities.
