Configure due date rules to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed within your specified SLO time frames. By setting these due dates, you can automate accountability, meet compliance requirements, and prioritize the prompt remediation of security issues, thereby preventing potential exploitation.

## Create a due date rule

1. On the [Vulnerability Pipeline][2] page, click **Add a New Rule** and select **Set Due Date**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the rule, for example, Cloud Infrastructure Anomaly Warnings.
1. Use the following boxes to configure the rule criteria:
    - **Any of these types**: The types of findings that the rule should check for. Available types include **Misconfiguration**, **Attack Path**, **Identity Risk**, and **API Security Finding**.
    - **Any of these tags or attributes**: The resource tags or attributes that must match for the rule to apply.
1. Set a due date for each severity level. You can also leave a severity without a due date if needed.
1. By default, due date rules send a second notification 3 days before the due date. To turn this setting off, switch the **Re-Notify** toggle to the off position. You can also adjust how many days in advance this reminder gets sent.
1. Click **Save**.

## Rule matching order

When Datadog identifies a vulnerability, it evaluates the vulnerability against your sequence of due date rules. Starting with the first rule, if there's a match, Datadog sets a due date on the vulnerability for the specified duration and stops evaluating further. If no match occurs, Datadog moves to the next rule. This process continues until a match is found or all rules are checked without a match.
