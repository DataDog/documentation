<div class="alert alert-info">CSM Identity Risks is in beta.</div>

Cloud Security Management Identity Risks (CSM Identity Risks) provides in-depth visibility into your organization's IAM risks. It enables you to detect and resolve identity risks on an ongoing basis to secure your cloud infrastructure from IAM-based attacks.

<div class="alert alert-info">At this time, CSM Identity Risks is available for AWS only.</div>

## Setup

To use CSM Identity Risks, you must [enable resource collection for AWS][2] and [enable CloudTrail logs forwarding][4]. If you've already done this, no additional setup is required.

**Note**: If you've enabled [Cloud Security Management Misconfigurations][5] for your AWS accounts, you already have [cloud resource collection][2] enabled. Similarly, if you use [Cloud SIEM][6], you already have [CloudTrail logs forwarding][4] enabled.

## Review and remediate identity risks

Review your organization's active identity risks on the [Identity Risks page][3]. Use the **Group by** options to filter by **Identity Risks**, **Resources**, or **None** (individual identity risks). View additional details on the side panel.

On the side panel, you can review the configuration of the resource on the **Resource** tab.

Click **Fix in AWS** to open the AWS console to remediate the identity risk. You can also use the **Insights** tab to get additional insights about the identity risk (for example, the permissions provisioned on the resource and whether they were used in the last 15 days).
