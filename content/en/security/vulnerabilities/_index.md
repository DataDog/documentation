## Overview

Cloud Security Management Vulnerabilities (CSM Vulnerabilities) helps you proactively secure your cloud infrastructure by detecting, prioritizing, and managing vulnerabilities across your container images and hosts. It leverages deep [observability context][6] and industry insights to help you remediate vulnerabilities that are most important to you at a given point in time. 

**Note**: If you're looking for vulnerability management for your application libraries and custom application code, see [Application Vulnerability Management][5].

## Explore vulnerabilities
The [Vulnerabilities Explorer][1] shows a complete list of vulnerabilities detected across your infrastructure, ordering them based on their severity, offering grouping, filtering, and triaging capabilities so you can investigate, assign, and remediate problems.

Select a specific vulnerability to see its details, including which containers and hosts are affected, severity breakdown score, and recommended remediation steps.
The severity of a vulnerability is modified from the base score to take into account the following:

- Whether the underlying infrastructure is running and how wide-spread the impact is.
- The environment in which the underlying infrastructure is running. For example, if the environment is not production, the severity is downgraded.
- Whether there is an active exploit for a given vulnerability from sources such as [CISA KEV catalog][9].

You can also view vulnerabilities in your container images on the [container images][2] page. Sort by **source**, **image tag**, **repo digest**, and more. View additional details about any vulnerability by clicking the container image and reviewing the **Vulnerabilities** tab.

On the details explorer, you can also view impacted resources in CSM to gain better insights to your overall risk.

All vulnerabilities include a collection of links and references to websites or information sources that help you understand the context behind each vulnerability.

## Triage and remediate

The [Vulnerabilities Explorer][1] also offers triaging options for detected vulnerabilities that enable you to change the status of a vulnerability, and assign it to individual members for remediation and tracking.

**Note**: To help you focus on the vulnerabilities that truly matter, vulnerabilities are auto-closed for infrastructure that is either no longer running, or contains the remediated fixed version of the previously-vulnerable package.
