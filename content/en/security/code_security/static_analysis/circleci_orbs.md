description: Use Datadog and CircleCI to run Static Code Analysis jobs in a CI pipeline.
title: Static Code Analysis and CircleCI Orbs
---

## Overview

Run a Datadog Static Code Analysis job in your CircleCI workflows.

## Setup

To use Datadog Static Code Analysis, you need to add a `static-analysis.datadog.yml` file in your repository's root directory to specify which rulesets to use.

```yaml
rulesets:
  - <ruleset-name>
  - <ruleset-name>
```

### Example for Python

You can see an example for Python-based repositories:

```yaml
rulesets:
  - python-code-style
  - python-best-practices
  - python-inclusive
```

## Workflow

Create a file in `.circleci` to run a Datadog Static Code Analysis job.

The following is a sample workflow file.

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  datadog-static-analysis: datadog/datadog-static-analyzer-circleci-orb@1
jobs:
  run-static-analysis-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - datadog-static-analysis/analyze:
          service: "my-service"
          env: "ci"
          site: {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}
          cpu_count: 2
          enable_performance_statistics: false
workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - run-static-analysis-job
```

### Environment variables
