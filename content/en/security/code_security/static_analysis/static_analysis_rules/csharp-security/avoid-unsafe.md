## Metadata
**ID:** `csharp-security/avoid-unsafe`

**Language:** C#

**Severity:** Notice

**Category:** Security

**CWE**: [823](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/823.html)

## Description
Avoid `unsafe` code blocks as much as possible. While `unsafe` blocks provide access to some important features of the C# language, you need to avoid using them as much as possible. For example, `unsafe` code allows developers to use pointers, but pointers and pointers arithmetic can lead to critical security issues. Unsafe code should be avoided or at least clearly identified in a small scope.
