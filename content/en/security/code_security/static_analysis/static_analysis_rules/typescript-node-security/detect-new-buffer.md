## Metadata
**ID:** `typescript-node-security/detect-new-buffer`

**Language:** TypeScript

**Severity:** Warning

**Category:** Security

## Description
Dealing with binary data can achieved with Node.js Buffer class, however if used with non literal params it could lead to an attack as the attacker might control the value of the provided parameter.

For example a large number could allocate a large amount of memory leading to a denial of service attack. It is recommended to use literal values you can control to prevent attacks.

## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```typescript
var a = new Buffer(c)
```

## Compliant Code Examples
```typescript
var a = new Buffer('test')
```
