## Metadata
**ID:** `java-best-practices/replace-hashtable-with-map`

**Language:** Java

**Severity:** Warning

**Category:** Best Practices

## Description
If your application does not require thread safety, it is recommended to use the modern `java.util.Map` interface instead of `java.util.Hashtable`. 

`Map` offers efficient implementations like `HashMap`, which offer greater flexibility and faster execution. If thread safety is needed, you can opt for `ConcurrentHashMap`, which maintains thread safety while still adhering to modern coding practices associated with `Map`.

## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```java
public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        Hashtable hashtable1 = new Hashtable(); // consider using java.util.Map instead
        Hashtable<String, Integer> hashtable2 = new Hashtable<>();
    }
}
```

## Compliant Code Examples
```java
public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        Map<String, Integer> h = new HashMap<>();
    }
}
```
