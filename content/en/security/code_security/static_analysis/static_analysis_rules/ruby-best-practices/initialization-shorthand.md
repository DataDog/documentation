## Metadata
**ID:** `ruby-best-practices/initialization-shorthand`

**Language:** Ruby

**Severity:** Info

**Category:** Best Practices

## Description
The rule "Use ||= to initialize variables if they are not already" is a best practice in Ruby to ensure clean, readable, and efficient code. The '||=' operator is used to assign a value to a variable only if the variable is currently `nil` or `false`. This is a more concise and readable way to express conditional assignment, as opposed to using the `unless` keyword.

This rule is important because it promotes code clarity and efficiency. Using '||=' for conditional assignment reduces the cognitive load on the developer reading the code, as it clearly expresses the intent in a single, straightforward operation. It also avoids unnecessary assignments when the variable is already initialized, potentially improving performance.

To adhere to this rule, use '||=' whenever you want to assign a value to a variable only if it's not already initialized. For instance, instead of writing `name = 'Bozhidar' unless name`, write `name ||= 'Bozhidar'`. This clearly communicates the intent and ensures the assignment only happens when necessary.

## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```ruby
name = 'Bozhidar' unless name
```

## Compliant Code Examples
```ruby
name ||= 'Bozhidar'
```
