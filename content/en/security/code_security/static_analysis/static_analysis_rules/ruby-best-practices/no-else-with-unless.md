**Language:** Ruby

**Severity:** Info

## Description
The rule "Do not use unless with else" is a coding guideline that promotes clarity and readability in Ruby code. The `unless` keyword in Ruby is used as the inverse of `if`, meaning it executes the code block only if the condition is false. When an `else` statement is added to an `unless` statement, it can make the logic harder to follow and understand, especially for those new to the language or the codebase.

Why is this important? Readability and clarity are essential for maintaining a healthy codebase. Code is read more often than it is written, and it is crucial that it remains clear to all developers in a team. An `unless-else` construct can be confusing because it effectively double-negates the logic, making it harder to understand at a glance. 

To avoid violating this rule, use an `if-else` construct instead. It conveys the same logic in a more straightforward manner. The `if-else` construct is also more common across different programming languages, making it easier for developers with different backgrounds to understand. For example, instead of writing `unless condition; else; end`, write `if !condition; else; end`.

## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```ruby
unless success?
  puts 'failure'
else
  # foo
  puts 'success'
end

```

## Compliant Code Examples
```ruby
if success?
  puts 'failure'
else
  #foo
  puts 'success'
end
```
