**Language:** Go

**Severity:** Info

**Category:** Best Practices

## Description
In Go programming, it is considered good coding practice to use the `is` or `has` prefix instead of `get` when naming functions that return a boolean value. This convention is suggested to improve code readability and maintainability.

The reason for this recommendation is that functions prefixed with `get` typically imply that they will return some value. Using `get` for a function that returns a boolean can be misleading and confusing for other developers who may expect it to return some non-boolean value.

By using the `is` or `has` prefix, it explicitly indicates that the function is intended to check the presence or state of a condition and will return a boolean value. This naming convention makes it easier for developers to understand the function's purpose and appropriately use it in their code.


## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```go
func getSomething() bool {
	
}
```

## Compliant Code Examples
```go
func hasSomething() bool {
	
}
```
