## Metadata
**ID:** `csharp-best-practices/sealed-class-protected-members`

**Language:** C#

**Severity:** Info

**Category:** Best Practices

## Description
While authorized by the compiler, `protected` visibility in `sealed` classes does not make sense as these classes cannot be inherited. Use `public` or `private` instead.

## Non-Compliant Code Examples
```csharp
public sealed class MyClass {
    protected int foo;

    protected void myMethod() {
        
    }
}

```

## Compliant Code Examples
```csharp
public sealed class MyClass {
    private int foo;

    private void myMethod() {
        
    }
}

```
