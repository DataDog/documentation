[Datadog Static Code Analysis][1] lets you define static analysis rules as custom rules. You can share these custom rules within your organization.

## Rule organization

SAST rules are organized within rulesets. A ruleset is a collection of rules. There are no constraints
on how rules are organized within a ruleset. For example, some users might want to have rulesets for a specific language and others for a category.

A ruleset must have a unique name with only letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`). Examples of valid
ruleset names are `python-security`, `cobra-team-checks`, or `my-company-security-checks`.

## Anatomy of a custom rule

A custom rule is composed of three main components:
 - A **tree-sitter query** that captures what AST elements to check.
 - **JavaScript code** that process the AST elements reports violations.
 - **Test code** to test the rule.

### Tree-sitter query

Custom rules use [tree-sitter queries][2] to query the code abstract syntax tree (AST) and retrieve elements to analyze. Elements of the AST are captured by the query using the `@` operator.

All captured nodes from the tree-sitter query are injected in the JavaScript code and further processed to
produce violations.

### JavaScript code

The JavaScript code is defined in a `visit` function. This function is triggered at each match of the tree-sitter query.
If a tree-sitter query captures a function call and the analyzed code contains 10 function calls, the `visit` function is called 10 times and each invocation has the capture of each occurrence.

The `visit` function has the signature `visit(node, path, code)`:
 - `node` is the tree-sitter context being matched.
 - `path` is the path under analysis (convenient for filtering violation on path or filename).
 - `code` is the code under analysis.

To get a captured node, use the `captures` attribute of the first argument of the `visit` function. For example, the code below retrieves the `functionName` from a tree-sitter query. Each element contains the following attributes:

 - `astType`: the tree-sitter type of the node.
 - `start`: start position of the node. The position contains `line` and `col` attributes.
 - `end`: end position of the node. The position contains `line` and `col` attributes.

```javascript
function visit(node, filename, code) {
  const functionNameNode = node.captures["functionName"];
  console.log("ast type");
  console.log(functionNameNode.astType);
  console.log("start line");
  console.log(functionNameNode.start.line);
}
```

The analyzer includes a few helper functions to help you write rules:
 - `getCodeForNode(node, code)` captures the code for a specific node.
 - `buildError(startLine, startCol, endLine, endCol, message, severity, category)` builds an error.
   - `severity` is one of the following: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE` and `INFO`.
   - `category` is one of the following: `BEST_PRACTICES`, `CODE_STYLE`, `ERROR_PRONE`, `PERFORMANCE` and `SECURITY`.
 - `addError(error)` reports an error.

### Rule examples

All Datadog default rules are available in [Code Security][4]. You can easily analyze and copy them to create your own custom rules.
