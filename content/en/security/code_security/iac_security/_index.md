Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security automatically analyzes your Terraform files for security misconfigurations. With IaC Security, you can:

- Scan Terraform files for security misconfigurations
- Surface IaC misconfigurations in the Code Security Vulnerabilities tab
- Group and filter findings by severity, triage status, and other facets
- View detailed remediation guidance and code snippets for each finding
- Track finding status and history for triage and resolution
- Configure scanning exclusions

<div class="alert alert-info">IaC Security supports GitHub for version control and Terraform for infrastructure as code.</div>

## Getting started

1. [Set up IaC Security][1] in your environment
2. Configure [scanning exclusions][2] to reduce false positives or ignore expected results
3. Review and triage findings in the [Code Security Vulnerabilities tab][3]
