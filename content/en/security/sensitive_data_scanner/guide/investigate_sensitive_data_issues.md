## Overview

Datadog's Sensitive Data Scanner can help prevent sensitive data leaks and limit non-compliance risks by identifying, classifying, and optionally redacting sensitive data. When a sensitive data issue is found, you might have the following questions:

- What sensitive data has been exposed?
- What is the priority of the sensitive data exposure?
- How severe is the issue in terms of spread and volume?
- Where did the sensitive data come from?

The Sensitive Data Scanner's [Summary][1] page categorizes and prioritizes sensitive data issues so that you can investigate, collaborate, and document your findings, and answer those questions.

## Triage sensitive data issues

Navigate to the [Summary][1] page to see all sensitive data issues within the selected time frame and start investigating issues.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Telemetry Data" %}}

In the **Sensitive Data Issues** section, filter by a priority level to see only issues with that priority level in the **Issues Overview** section. In the **Cases** section, filter by a case status to see issues associated to cases with that status in the **Issues Overview** section.

To investigate an issue:

1. Click on the issue in the **Issues Overview**.
2. In the issue panel, click **View Recent Changes** to navigate to [Audit Trail][3] and see if there are any recent configuration changes that caused the sensitive data issue.
3. Use the following options to explore different types of data matching the query:
    a. To view all logs related to the query in Log Explorer, click **View All Logs**.<br>
    b. To view all traces matching the query in Trace Explorer, click **View All APM Spans**.<br>
    c. To view all RUM events matching the query, click **View All RUM Events**.<br>
    d. To view all events matching the query, click **View All Events**.

4. In the **Blast Radius** section:<br>
    a. View the Top 10 services, hosts, and environments impacted by this sensitive data issue.<br>
    b. Click on a service to see more information about the service in the **Software Catalog**.<br>
    c. Click on a host to see more information about the host in the Infrastructure List page.

If you want to modify the Scanning Rule that was used to detect the sensitive data issue, click **Modify Rule** at the top of the panel.

Additionally, you can also:
- Use [Case Management][1] to track, triage, and investigate the issue, click **Create Case** at the top of the panel. Associated cases are surfaced in the Summary page.
- Use [Incident Management][2] to create an incident, you can add the issue to an existing incident or declare a new incident. Click the **Declare Incident** dropdown menu to add the issue to an existing incident. Click **Declare Incident** to declare a new incident.
- Use [Audit Trail][3] to see who may have accessed this sensitive data within Datadog, **View in Audit Trail** in the **Users who accessed these events** section.

Click the **Datastores with Sensitive Data** tab to see all sensitive data issues for Cloud Storage.

In the **xxx Datastores with Sensitive section**, click on any of the dropdown menus to filter on datastores based on the type of sensitive data, account, region, team and so on.

To investigate a datastore:

1. Click on a datastore.
1. You can view files where sensitive data was found and then click on a file to inspect it in AWS.
  Datadog recommends doing the following:
    - Review a few files to get a sense of the classification accuracy.
    - Follow up with the team or service owner listed in the side panel to confirm whether sensitive data is meant to be in the bucket.
      - If it is not supposed to be in the bucket, delete the files or move them to an appropriate bucket.
      - If it is supposed to be in the bucket, complete the following steps to improve your security posture:
        1. Click the **Security** tab in the side panel and review the **Misconfigurations** section.
        1. Click on a misconfiguration to see details in Cloud Security Management.
        1. In the **Next Steps** section:
            1. Under **Triage**, click the dropdown to change the triage status of the signal. The default status is `OPEN`.
            1. Click **Assign Signal** to assign a signal to yourself or another Datadog user.
            1. Click **See remediation** to see more information on how to remediate the issue.
            1. Under **More Actions**, you can add a Jira issue, run workflows, or add a comment.
        To run a workflow, select **Run Workflow** and then in the workflow browser, search and select a workflow to run. See [Automate Security Workflows with Workflow Automation][1] for more information.
          1. Click on the different tabs to see the severity breakdown, related logs, and timeline of the issue.
