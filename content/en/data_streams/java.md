### Prerequisites

To start with Data Streams Monitoring, you need recent versions of the Datadog Agent and Java libraries:
* [Datadog Agent v7.34.0 or later][1]
* [APM enabled with the Java Agent][2]
  * Kafka and RabbitMQ: v1.9.0 or later
  * Amazon SQS: v1.27.0 or later

### Installation

Java uses auto-instrumentation to inject and extract additional metadata required by Data Streams Monitoring for measuring end-to-end latencies and the relationship between queues and services. To enable Data Streams Monitoring, set the `DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` on services sending messages to (or consuming messages from) Kafka or RabbitMQ.

For example:
```yaml
environment:
  - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
```

As an alternative, you can set the `-Ddd.data.streams.enabled=true` system property by running the following when you start your Java application:

```bash
java -javaagent:/path/to/dd-java-agent.jar -Ddd.data.streams.enabled=true -jar path/to/your/app.jar
```
### Supported libraries
Data Streams Monitoring supports the [confluent-kafka library][3].

### Monitoring SQS pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses one [message attribute][4] to track a message's path through an SQS queue. As Amazon SQS has a maximum limit of 10 message attributes allowed per message, all messages streamed through the data pipelines must have 9 or fewer message attributes set, allowing the remaining attribute for Data Streams Monitoring.
