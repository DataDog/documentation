### Installation

Java uses auto-instrumentation to inject and extract additional metadata required by Data Streams Monitoring for measuring end-to-end latencies and the relationship between queues and services. To enable Data Streams Monitoring, set the `DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` on services sending messages to (or consuming messages from) Kafka, SQS or RabbitMQ.

Also, set the `DD_TRACE_REMOVE_INTEGRATION_SERVICE_NAMES_ENABLED` variable to `true` so that `DD_SERVICE` is used as the service name in traces.

For example:
```yaml
environment:
  - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
  - DD_TRACE_REMOVE_INTEGRATION_SERVICE_NAMES_ENABLED: "true"
```

As an alternative, you can set the `-Ddd.data.streams.enabled=true` system property by running the following when you start your Java application:

```bash
java -javaagent:/path/to/dd-java-agent.jar -Ddd.data.streams.enabled=true -Ddd.trace.remove.integration-service-names.enabled=true -jar path/to/your/app.jar
```

### One-Click Installation
To set up Data Streams Monitoring from the Datadog UI without needing to restart your service, use [Configuration at Runtime][4]. Navigate to the APM Service Page and `Enable DSM`.

### Monitoring SQS pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses one [message attribute][3] to track a message's path through an SQS queue. As Amazon SQS has a maximum limit of 10 message attributes allowed per message, all messages streamed through the data pipelines must have 9 or fewer message attributes set, allowing the remaining attribute for Data Streams Monitoring.

### Monitoring SNS-to-SQS pipelines
To monitor a data pipeline where Amazon SNS talks directly to Amazon SQS, you must perform the following additional configuration steps:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "SQS v1" %}}
- Set the environment variable `DD_TRACE_SQS_BODY_PROPAGATION_ENABLED` to `true`.

   For example:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
     - DD_TRACE_REMOVE_INTEGRATION_SERVICE_NAMES_ENABLED: "true"
     - DD_TRACE_SQS_BODY_PROPAGATION_ENABLED: "true"
   ```
- Ensure that you are using [Java tracer v1.44.0+][1].

### Monitoring Kinesis pipelines
There are no message attributes in Kinesis to propagate context and track a message's full path through a Kinesis stream. As a result, Data Streams Monitoring's end-to-end latency metrics are approximated based on summing latency on segments of a message's path, from the producing service through a Kinesis Stream, to a consumer service. Throughput metrics are based on segments from the producing service through a Kinesis Stream, to the consumer service. The full topology of data streams can still be visualized through instrumenting services.

### Manual instrumentation
Data Streams Monitoring propagates context through message headers. If you are using a message queue technology that is not supported by DSM, a technology without headers (such as Kinesis), or Lambdas, use [manual instrumentation to set up DSM][5].
