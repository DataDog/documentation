### Prerequisites

To start with Data Streams Monitoring, you need recent versions of the Datadog Agent and Node.js libraries:
* [Datadog Agent v7.34.0 or later][1]
* [Node.js Tracer][2]
  * Kafka: v2.39.0, v3.26.0, v4.5.0, or later
  * Amazon SQS: v4.21.0

### Installation

Node.js uses auto-instrumentation to inject and extract additional metadata required by Data Streams Monitoring for measuring end-to-end latencies and the relationship between queues and services. To enable Data Streams Monitoring, set the `DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` on services sending messages to (or consuming messages from) Kafka.

For example:
```yaml
environment:
  - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Supported libraries
Data Streams Monitoring supports the [confluent-kafka library][3].

### Monitoring SQS pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses one [message attribute][4] to track a message's path through an SQS queue. As Amazon SQS has a maximum limit of 10 message attributes allowed per message, all messages streamed through the data pipelines must have 9 or fewer message attributes set, allowing the remaining attribute for Data Streams Monitoring.
