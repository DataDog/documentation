### Prerequisites

To start with Data Streams Monitoring, you need recent versions of the Datadog Agent and Python libraries:
* [Datadog Agent v7.34.0 or later][1]
* [Python Tracer][2]
  * Kafka: v1.16.0 or later
  * Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis: v1.20.0

### Installation

Python uses auto-instrumentation to inject and extract additional metadata required by Data Streams Monitoring for measuring end-to-end latencies and the relationship between queues and services. To enable Data Streams Monitoring, set the `DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` on services sending messages to (or consuming messages from) Kafka.

For example:
```yaml
environment:
  - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Libraries Supported
Data Streams Monitoring supports the [confluent-kafka library][3].

### Monitoring SQS Pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses one [message attribute][4] to track a message's path through an SQS queue. As Amazon SQS has a maximum limit of 10 message attributes allowed per message, all messages streamed through the data pipelines must have 9 or less message attributes set, allowing the remaining attribute for Data Streams Monitoring.

### Monitoring Kinesis Pipelines
There are no message attributes in Kinesis to propagate context and track a message's full path through a Kinesis stream. As a result, Data Streams Monitoring's end-to-end latency metrics are approximated based on summing latency on segments of a message's path, from the producing service through a Kinesis Stream, to a consumer service. Throughput metrics are based on segments from the producing service through a Kinesis Stream, to the consumer service. The full topology of data streams can still be visualized through instrumenting services.
