Data Streams Monitoring provides a standardized method for teams to understand and manage pipelines at scale by making it easy to:
* Measure pipeline health with end-to-end latencies for events traversing across your system.
* Pinpoint faulty producers, consumers or queues, then pivot to related logs or clusters to troubleshoot faster.
* Prevent cascading delays by equipping service owners to stop backed up events from overwhelming downstream services.

## Setup

To get started, follow the installation instructions to configure services with Data Streams Monitoring:

{{< partial name="data_streams/setup-languages.html" >}}

<br/>

| Runtime | Supported technologies |
|---|----|
| Java | Kafka (self-hosted, Amazon MSK, Confluent Cloud / Platform), RabbitMQ, HTTP, gRPC |
| Go | All (with [manual instrumentation][1]) |
| .NET | Kafka (self-hosted, Amazon MSK), RabbitMQ |


## Explore Data Streams Monitoring

### Measure end-to-end pipeline health with new metrics

Once Data Streams Monitoring is configured, you can measure the time it usually takes for events to traverse between any two points in your asynchronous system:

| Metric Name | Notable Tags | Description |
|---|---|-----|
| data_streams.latency | `start`, `end`, `env` | End to end latency of a pathway from a specified source to destination service |
| data_streams.kafka.lag_seconds | `consumer_group`, `partition`, `topic`, `env` | Lag in seconds between producer and consumer. Requires Java Agent v1.9.0 or later. |

You can also graph and visualize these metrics on any dashboard or notebook:

### Monitor end-to-end latency of any pathway

Depending on how events traverse through your system, different paths can lead to increased latency. With the **Pathways** tab, you can view latency between any two points throughout your pipelines, including queues, producers, and consumers to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance. Easily create a monitor for a pathway, or export to a dashboard.

### Attribute incoming messages to any queue, service, or cluster

High lag on a consuming service, increased resource use on a Kafka broker and increased RabbitMQ queue size are frequently explained by changes in the way adjacent services are producing to or consuming from these entities.

Click on the **Throughput** tab on any service or queue in Data Streams Monitoring to quickly detect changes in throughput, and which upstream or downstream service these changes originate from. Once the [Service Catalog][2] is configured, you can immediately pivot to the corresponding team's Slack channel or on-call engineer.

By filtering to a single Kafka or RabbitMQ cluster, you can detect changes in incoming or outgoing traffic for all detected topics or queues running on that cluster:

### Quickly pivot to identify root causes in infrastructure, logs, or traces 

Datadog automatically links the infrastructure powering your services and related logs through [Unified Service Tagging][3], so you can easily localize bottlenecks. Click the **Infra** or **Logs** tabs to further troubleshoot why pathway latency or consumer lag has increased. To view traces within your pathways, click the **Processing Latency** tab.
