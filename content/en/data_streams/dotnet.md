| Amazon SQS        | [Amazon SQS SDK][5]             | 2.48.0                 | 2.48.0 or later            |
| Amazon SNS        | [Amazon SNS SDK][6]             | 3.6.0                  | 3.6.0 or later             |
| IBM MQ            | [IBMMQDotnetClient][7]          | 2.49.0                 | 2.49.0 or later            |
| Azure Service Bus <br><br> (requires [additional setup][8]) | [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus][9] | 2.53.0                 | 2.53.0 or later            |

### Installation

.NET uses auto-instrumentation to inject and extract additional metadata required by Data Streams Monitoring for measuring end-to-end latencies and the relationship between queues and services. To enable Data Streams Monitoring, set the `DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` on services sending messages to (or consuming messages from) Kafka or RabbitMQ.

For example:
```yaml
environment:
  - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Monitoring SQS pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses one [message attribute][2] to track a message's path through an SQS queue. As Amazon SQS has a maximum limit of 10 message attributes allowed per message, all messages streamed through the data pipelines must have 9 or fewer message attributes set, allowing the remaining attribute for Data Streams Monitoring.

### Monitoring SNS-to-SQS pipelines
To monitor a data pipeline where Amazon SNS talks directly to Amazon SQS, you must enable [Amazon SNS raw message delivery][11].

### Monitoring Azure Service Bus

Setting up Data Streams Monitoring for Azure Service Bus applications requires additional configuration for the instrumented application.

1. Either set the environment variable `AZURE_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ACTIVITY_SOURCE` to `true`, or in your application code set the `Azure.Experimental.EnableActivitySource` context switch to `true`. This instructs the Azure Service Bus library to generate tracing information. See [Azure SDK documentation][10] for more details.
2. Set the `DD_TRACE_OTEL_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`. This instructs the .NET auto-instrumentation to listen to the tracing information generated by the Azure Service Bus Library and enables the inject and extract operations required for Data Streams Monitoring.
