### Installation

.NET uses auto-instrumentation to inject and extract additional metadata required by Data Streams Monitoring for measuring end-to-end latencies and the relationship between queues and services. To enable Data Streams Monitoring, set the `DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` on services sending messages to (or consuming messages from) Kafka or RabbitMQ.

For example:
```yaml
environment:
  - DD_DATA_STREAMS_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Monitoring SQS pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses one [message attribute][5] to track a message's path through an SQS queue. As Amazon SQS has a maximum limit of 10 message attributes allowed per message, all messages streamed through the data pipelines must have 9 or fewer message attributes set, allowing the remaining attribute for Data Streams Monitoring.
