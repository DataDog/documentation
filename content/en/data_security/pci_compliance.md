## Overview

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) has rigorous monitoring and data security requirements for all merchants, service providers, and financial institutions. To meet these requirements, organizations have had to separate out PCI-regulated data and non-regulated data to different applications for monitoring.

Datadog offers PCI-compliant Log Management and Application Performance Monitoring (APM) within the [US1 site][1] so that you can collect all of your logs, whether they are PCI-regulated or not, in one place. See [Set up a PCI-compliant Datadog organization](#set-up-a-pci-compliant-datadog-organization) on how to get started.
