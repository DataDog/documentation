## Overview

Datadog tracing libraries can automatically report handled errors. The errors are attached through span events to the span in which they are handled. They are also directly reported to Error Tracking.

## Requirements
Supported languages
: Python, Ruby

- Your Datadog Agent must be configured for [Standalone Backend Error Tracking][1] or [APM][2]. You must be running Agent version `7.61.0` or higher.
- Your application must be instrumented with:
  - `dd-trace-py` version `3.8.0` or higher for Python
  - `dd-trace-rb` version `2.16.0` or higher for Ruby

Capturing handled errors is only available in APM Error Tracking or Standalone Backend Error Tracking. Error Tracking for Logs and RUM is not supported.
