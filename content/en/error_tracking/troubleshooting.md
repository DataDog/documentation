title: Error Tracking Troubleshooting
---

If you experience unexpected behavior with Error Tracking, the troubleshooting steps below can help you resolve the issue quickly. If you continue to have trouble, reach out to [Datadog support][1].

Datadog recommends regularly updating to the latest version of the Datadog tracing libraries, mobile SDKs, and web SDKs, as each release contains improvements and fixes.

## Errors are not found in Error Tracking

### Logs

Make sure the error message has the [required attributes][2], and Error Tracking for Logs is [activated][7].

This [example query][3] searches for logs meeting the criteria for inclusion in Error Tracking.

### APM

To be processed by Error Tracking, a span must have these attributes:

- `error.type`
- `error.message`
- `error.stack`

**Note**: The stack must have at least two lines and one *meaningful* frame (a frame with a function name and a filename in most languages).

This [example query][5] searches for spans meeting the criteria for inclusion in Error Tracking.

### RUM

Error Tracking only processes errors that are sent with the source set to `custom`, `source`, `report`, `network` or `console`, and contain a stack trace.

This [example query][6] shows RUM errors that meet the criteria for inclusion in Error Tracking.

## No error samples found for an issue

All errors are processed, but only retained errors are available in the issue panel as an error sample.

### APM

Spans associated with the error need to be retained with a custom retention filter in order for samples of that error to show up in the issue panel.
