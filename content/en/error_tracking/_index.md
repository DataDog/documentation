## Overview

It is critical for your system's health to consistently monitor the errors collected by Datadog. When there are many individual error events, it becomes hard to prioritize errors for troubleshooting. By tracking, triaging, and debugging logs, you can minimize the impact of fatal errors on your browser, mobile, and backend services.

Error Tracking enables you to:

- Set monitors on error tracking events such as high error volumes or new issues introduced.
- Group similar errors into issues, so that you can more easily identify important errors and reduce noise.
- Follow issues over time to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing, and how often they are occurring.
- Collect all the necessary context in one place to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Supported products

Error Tracking can ingest errors from the following Datadog products:

- [APM][1]
