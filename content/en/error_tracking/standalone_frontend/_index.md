  Datadog's standalone frontend Error Tracking experience is in private alpha. This product is in active development and may evolve with your usage.

## Overview

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/error_tracking/rum-et-explorer.png" alt="The details of an issue in the Error Tracking Explorer" style="width:100%;" >}}

It is critical for your systemâ€™s health to consistently monitor the errors collected by Datadog. When there are many individual error events, it becomes hard to prioritize errors for troubleshooting.

Error Tracking simplifies debugging by grouping thousands of similar errors into a single issue. Error Tracking enables you to:

- Track, triage, and debug fatal errors
- Group similar errors into issues, so that you can more easily identify important errors and reduce noise
- Set monitors on error tracking events, such as high error volume or new issues
- Follow issues over time to know when they first started, if they are still ongoing, and how often they occur
- See a detailed timeline of steps a user took leading up to the error, simplifying the process to reproduce and resolve errors quickly
