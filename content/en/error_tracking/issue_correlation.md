## Overview 

{{< img src="error_tracking/issue-correlation-overview.png" alt="The view of the correlated issues tab in the context of the Error Tracking Explorer" style="width:100%;" >}}

You use Error Tracking to simplify debugging by grouping thousands of similar errors into a single issue. Use issue correlation to determine the cause of the issue, the impact it has on other services, and if the error is a result of a downstream dependency. 

Issue correlation also helps reduce noise from the issue list by identifying the most critical issues. This allows you to alert the right team and reach a quicker resolution. 

## Identify correlated issues
To identify which issues across your services are correlated, navigate to the Error Tracking page at [**Error > Issues**][1].

Open the `Correlated issues` tab to see the issue correlation map

The issue correlation map shows the following information about a given issue:
- **Root cause**: the services that are likely to be causing the issue
- **Current issue**: the issue selected along with whether it is assigned to a team
- **Impact**: the resources, users and sessions that are impacted
