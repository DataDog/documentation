## Overview

Issue Team Ownership automates your triaging work by assigning issues to the right teams. Your team owns an issue if it is either:
- code owner of the top-level stack frame of the issue according to GitHub `CODEOWNERS`.
- owner of the service where the issue happens.

**Note**: Stack frames linking to third-party files are not taken into account. Only the top-most stack frame related to a file present in your repository is considered.

## Leverage team ownership

Team ownership information appears on the issue details panel when available:

You can also use issue team ownership to filter issues by teams in the Error Tracking Explorer.

## Setup

### Configure Source Code Integration

1. Ensure [Source Code Integration][1] is set up.
2. Install [the GitHub integration][2].
3. Make sure all requested permissions (Contents, Members) are granted for the GitHub integration.

### Set up a CODEOWNERS file
Create a valid `CODEOWNERS` file in your repository following [GitHub's CODEOWNERS standards][3].

### Link GitHub teams to Datadog teams

In Datadog, go to **Teams** > Select your team > **Settings** > **GitHub Connection** to map your Datadog teams to the corresponding GitHub teams defined in your `CODEOWNERS` file.

**Note**: Issue Team Ownership only supports GitHub.

## Configuration

Issue Team Ownership is enabled by default for all services once the setup requirements are met. You can control this feature at both global and service levels through the Error Tracking settings page.
