title: Issue States in Error Tracking
kind: documentation

## Overview

All issues in Error Tracking have a status to help you triage and prioritize issues or dismiss noise. There are four statuses:

- **FOR REVIEW**: Ongoing and in need of attention because the issue is new or it's a regression.
- **REVIEWED**: Triaged and needs to be fixed, either now or later. 
- **IGNORED**: Requiring no additional investigation or action.
- **RESOLVED**: Fixed and no longer occurring.

All issues start with a FOR REVIEW status. Error Tracking automatically updates the status in the cases described below, or you can [manually update the status](#updating-an-error-status). You can also [view the history](#issue-history) of a given error's state changes.

The diagram below shows how the Error Tracking states are updated automatically and manually:

## Automatic review

Error Tracking automatically marks issues as **REVIEWED** if one of the following actions has been taken:

- The issue has been assigned
- A case has been created from the issue

## Automatic resolution

Error Tracking automatically marks issues as **RESOLVED** that appear to be inactive or resolved due to a lack of recent error occurrences:

- If the issue was last reported in a version that is more than 14 days old, and a newer version has been released but does not report the same error, Error Tracking automatically resolves the issue. Configure your services with version tags (see instructions for [APM][1], [RUM][2], and [Logs][3]) to ensure that automatic resolution accounts for versions of your services. 
- If `version` tags are not set up, Error Tracking automatically resolves an issue if there have been no new errors reported for that issue within the last 14 days.

## Automatic re-opening through regression detection

If a **RESOLVED** error recurs in a newer version of the code, or the error occurs again in code without versions, Error Tracking triggers a regression. The issue moves to the **FOR REVIEW** state, and is tagged with a **Regression** tag:

Regressions take into account the versions of your service where the error is known to occur, and only trigger on new versions after an issue is marked as **RESOLVED**. Configure your services with version tags (see instructions for [APM][1], [RUM][2], and [Logs][3]) to ensure that issues automatically resolve only if the same errors occur on newer versions of your services.

If you don't have version tags set up, issues are tagged with **Regression** when an error occurs on an issue marked as **RESOLVED**.

You can also set up [monitors][4] to alert you when regressions occur.

## Updating the issue status

The issue status appears anywhere the issue can be viewed, such as in the issues list or on the details panel for a given issue. To manually update the status of an issue, click the status and choose a different one in the dropdown menu.

## Issue history
View a history of your issue activity with the **Activity Timeline**. On the details panel of any Error Tracking issue, view the Activity Timeline by clicking the **Activity** tab.
