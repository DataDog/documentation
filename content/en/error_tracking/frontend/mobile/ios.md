## Overview

Enable iOS Crash Reporting and Error Tracking to get comprehensive crash reports and error trends. With this feature, you can access:

 - Aggregated iOS crash dashboards and attributes
 - Symbolicated iOS crash reports
 - Trend analysis with iOS error tracking

To symbolicate your stack traces, find and upload your `.dSYM` files to Datadog. Then, verify your configuration by running a test crash and restarting your application.

Your crash reports appear in [**Error Tracking**][1].

## Setup

To start sending Error Tracking data from your iOS or tvOS application to Datadog:

### Step 1 - Declare the iOS SDK as a dependency

Declare the iOS library as a dependency depending on your package manager. Swift Package Manager (SPM) is recommended.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Swift Package Manager (SPM)" %}}

To integrate using Apple's Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Datadog/dd-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0"))
```

In your project, link the following libraries:
```
DatadogCore
DatadogRUM
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "CocoaPods" %}}

You can use [CocoaPods][1] to install `dd-sdk-ios`:
```
pod 'DatadogCore'
pod 'DatadogRUM'
```

[1]: https://cocoapods.org/

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Carthage" %}}

You can use [Carthage][1] to install `dd-sdk-ios`:

```
github "DataDog/dd-sdk-ios"
```

**Note**: Datadog does not provide prebuilt Carthage binaries. This means Carthage builds the SDK from source.
To build and integrate the SDK, run:
```
carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks --no-use-binaries
```

After building, add the following XCFrameworks to your Xcode project (in the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section):
```
DatadogInternal.xcframework
DatadogCore.xcframework
DatadogRUM.xcframework
```

[1]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

{{< /tabs >}}

### Step 2 - Specify application details in the UI

1. Navigate to **Error Tracking** > **[Settings][2]** > **Browser and Mobile**.
2. Click **New Application**.
3. Enter an application name and select **iOS** as the application type.
4. Click **Create Application** to generate a unique Datadog application ID and client token.

### Step 3 - Initialize the library

#### Update the initialization snippet

In the initialization snippet, set an environment name and service name.

To ensure the safety of your data, you must use a client token. If you used only [Datadog API keys][5] to configure the `dd-sdk-ios` library, they would be exposed client-side in the iOS application's byte code.

For more information about setting up a client token, see the [Client token documentation][6].

The SDK should be initialized as early as possible in the app lifecycle, specifically in the `AppDelegate`'s `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` callback. This ensures all measurements, including application startup duration, are captured correctly. For apps built with SwiftUI, you can use `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` to hook into the `AppDelegate`.

<div class="alert alert-warning">Initializing the SDK elsewhere (for example, later during view loading) may result in inaccurate or missing telemetry, especially around app startup performance.</div>

#### Instrument your webviews (optional)

Add the DatadogWebViewTracking module using your preferred dependency manager.

To track errors and performance issues within web content, enable webview tracking for your WKWebView instances. This allows you to monitor JavaScript errors, network requests, and user interactions that occur within embedded web pages, giving you complete visibility into your hybrid app's web components.

Specify which hosts to track by providing a list of domains. Only web content from the specified hosts are monitored and reported to Datadog.

```swift
import DatadogWebViewTracking

let webview = WKWebView(...)

// start tracking webviews
WebViewTracking.enable(webView: webview, hosts: ["foo.bar"])

//stop tracking webviews (after the user stops navigating the web page)
WebViewTracking.disable(webView: webview)
```

For more information, see [Web View Tracking][3].

### Step 4 - Add crash reporting

Crash reporting captures fatal crashes when your app terminates unexpectedly, in addition to the errors that Error Tracking displays in a unified interface.

To enable crash reporting, add the package according to your dependency manager and update your initialize snippet.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Swift Package Manager (SPM)" %}}

To integrate using Apple's Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Datadog/dd-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0"))
```

In your project, link the following libraries:
```
DatadogCrashReporting
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "CocoaPods" %}}

You can use [CocoaPods][1] to install `dd-sdk-ios`:
```
pod 'DatadogCrashReporting'
```

[1]: https://cocoapods.org/

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Carthage" %}}

You can use [Carthage][1] to install `dd-sdk-ios`:
```
github "DataDog/dd-sdk-ios"
```

In Xcode, link the following frameworks:
```
DatadogCrashReporting.xcframework
CrashReporter.xcframework
```

[1]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Update your initialization snippet to include Crash Reporting:

```swift
import DatadogCore
import DatadogCrashReporting

Datadog.initialize(...)

CrashReporting.enable()
```

### Step 5 - Add app hang reporting

App hangs are an iOS-specific type of error that happens when the application is unresponsive for too long. App hangs are reported through the iOS SDK (not through [Logs][10]). By default, app hangs reporting is **disabled**, but you can enable it and set your own threshold to monitor app hangs that last longer than a duration you can specify in the `appHangThreshold` initialization parameter. When enabled, any main thread pause that is longer than the specified `appHangThreshold` is considered a _hang_ in [**Error Tracking**][1]. A customizable threshold allows you to find the right balance between fine-grained and noisy observability. See [Configure the app hang threshold](#configure-app-hang-threshold) for more guidance on setting this value.

There are two types of hangs:

- **Fatal app hang**: How a hang gets reported if it never gets recovered and the app is terminated. Fatal app hangs are marked as a "Crash" in Error Tracking and the RUM explorer.

  {{< img src="real_user_monitoring/error_tracking/ios-fatal-app-hang-1.png" alt="A fatal app hang in the Error side panel." style="width:60%;" >}}

- **Non-fatal app hang**: How a hang gets reported if the app recovers from a relatively short hang and continues running. Non-fatal app hangs do not have a "Crash" mark on them in Error Tracking and the RUM explorer.

  {{< img src="real_user_monitoring/error_tracking/ios-non-fatal-app-hang-1.png" alt="A non-fatal app hang in the Error side panel." style="width:60%;" >}}

{{% collapse-content title="Enable app hang monitoring" level="h4" expanded=false id="enable-app-hang-monitoring" %}}

To enable app hang monitoring:

1. [Enable Crash Reporting](#step-4---add-crash-reporting).

2. Update the initialization snippet with the `appHangThreshold` parameter:

   ```swift
   RUM.enable(
       with: RUM.Configuration(
           applicationID: "<application id>",
           appHangThreshold: 0.25
       )
   )
   ```

3. Set the `appHangThreshold` parameter to the minimal duration you want app hangs to be reported, in seconds. For example, enter `0.25` to report hangs lasting at least 250 ms. See [Configure the app hang threshold](#configure-app-hang-threshold) for more guidance on setting this value.

   Make sure you follow the steps below to get [deobfuscated stack traces](#step-6---get-deobfuscated-stack-traces), which transform cryptic memory addresses into readable function names and line numbers for effective debugging. 

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Configure the app hang threshold" level="h4" expanded=false id="configure-app-hang-threshold" %}}

Choose the right threshold value based on your monitoring needs:

- **For development and debugging:**
  - Start with `appHangThreshold: 0.25` seconds (250 ms) to catch most performance issues
  - Adjust incrementally (lower or higher) to find the right setup for your specific needs
- **For production monitoring:**
  - Set `appHangThreshold` between `2.0` and `3.0` seconds to filter out noisy hangs and focus on significant performance issues
  - This aligns with user experience expectations, where hangs under 2 seconds are less noticeable

#### Threshold limits
- Minimum: `0.1` seconds (100 ms) - however, setting the threshold to such small values may lead to an excessive reporting of hangs
- Recommended range: `0.25` to `3.0` seconds
- The SDK uses 2.5% tolerance to reduce CPU usage, which means some hangs that last close to the `appHangThreshold` may not be reported

##### Configuration example
```swift
RUM.enable(
    with: RUM.Configuration(
        applicationID: "<application id>",
        appHangThreshold: 2.0  // Report hangs lasting 2+ seconds
    )
)
```

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Disable app hang monitoring" level="h4" expanded=false id="set-tracking-consent" %}}

To disable app hang monitoring, update the initialization snippet and set the `appHangThreshold` parameter to `nil`.

{{% /collapse-content %}}

### Step 6 - Get deobfuscated stack traces

To help you debug errors, Datadog uses a unique generated build ID to deobfuscate stack traces, matching them with their corresponding mapping files. This process occurs regardless of whether the mapping files were uploaded during pre-production or production builds, ensuring the correct information is available for efficient QA processes when reviewing crashes and errors in Datadog.

For iOS applications, the matching of stack traces and symbol files relies on their `uuid` field.

{{% collapse-content title="Symbolicate crash reports" level="h4" expanded=false id="symbolicate-crash-reports" %}}

Crash reports are collected in a raw format and mostly contain memory addresses. To map these addresses into legible symbol information, Datadog requires .`dSYM` files, which are generated in your application's build or distribution process.

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Find your .dSYM file" level="h4" expanded=false id="find-your-dsym-file" %}}

Every iOS application produces `.dSYM` files for each application module. These files minimize an application's binary size and enable faster download speed. Each application version contains a set of `.dSYM` files.

Depending on your setup, you may need to download `.dSYM` files from App Store Connect or find them on your local machine.

| Bitcode Enabled | Description |
|---|---|
| Yes | `.dSYM` files are available after [App Store Connect][12] completes processing your application's build. |
| No | Xcode exports `.dSYM` files to `$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH` at the end of your application's build. Ensure that the `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` build setting is set to **DWARF with dSYM File**. By default, Xcode projects only set `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` to **DWARF with dSYM File** for the Release project configuration. |

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Upload your .dSYM file" level="h4" expanded=false id="upload-your-dsym-file" %}}

By uploading your `.dSYM` file to Datadog, you gain access to the file path and line number of each frame in an error's related stack trace.

After your application crashes and you restart the application, the iOS SDK uploads a crash report to Datadog.

**Note**: Re-uploading a source map does not override the existing one if the version has not changed.

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Use Datadog CI to upload your .dSYM file" level="h4" expanded=false id="datadog-ci-upload-dsym-file" %}}

You can use the command line tool [@datadog/datadog-ci][13] to upload your `.dSYM` file:

```sh
export DATADOG_API_KEY="<API KEY>"

// if you have a zip file containing dSYM files
npx @datadog/datadog-ci dsyms upload appDsyms.zip

// if you have a folder containing dSYM files
npx @datadog/datadog-ci dsyms upload /path/to/appDsyms/
```

**Note**: To configure the tool using the EU endpoint, set the `DATADOG_SITE` environment variable to `datadoghq.eu`. To override the full URL for the intake endpoint, define the `DATADOG_DSYM_INTAKE_URL` environment variable.

Alternatively, if you use Fastlane or GitHub Actions in your workflows, you can leverage these integrations instead of `datadog-ci`:

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Use Fastlane plugin to upload your .dSYM file" level="h4" expanded=false id="fastlane-plugin" %}}

The Fastlane plugin helps you upload `.dSYM` files to Datadog from your Fastlane configuration.

1. Add [`fastlane-plugin-datadog`][14] to your project.

   ```sh
   fastlane add_plugin datadog
   ```

2. Configure Fastlane to upload your symbols.

   ```ruby
   # download_dsyms action feeds dsym_paths automatically
   lane :upload_dsym_with_download_dsyms do
     download_dsyms
     upload_symbols_to_datadog(api_key: "datadog-api-key")
   end
   ```

For more information, see [`fastlane-plugin-datadog`][14].

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Use GitHub Actions to upload your .dSYM file" level="h4" expanded=false id="github-actions" %}}

The [Datadog Upload dSYMs GitHub Action][15] allows you to upload your symbols in your GitHub Action jobs:

```yml
name: Upload dSYM Files

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate/Download dSYM Files
        uses: ./release.sh

      - name: Upload dSYMs to Datadog
        uses: DataDog/upload-dsyms-github-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          site: datadoghq.com
          dsym_paths: |
            path/to/dsyms/folder
            path/to/zip/dsyms.zip
```

For more information, see [dSYMs commands][16].

## Test your implementation

To verify your iOS Crash Reporting and Error Tracking configuration, issue a crash in your application and confirm that the error appears in Datadog.

1. Run your application on an iOS simulator or a real device. Ensure that the debugger is not attached. Otherwise, Xcode captures the crash before the iOS SDK does.
2. Execute the code containing the crash:

   ```swift
   func didTapButton() {
   fatalError("Crash the app")
   }
   ```

3. After the crash happens, restart your application and wait for the iOS SDK to upload the crash report in [**Error Tracking**][1].

**Note:** Error Tracking supports symbolication of system symbol files for iOS v14+ arm64 and arm64e architecture.

## Advanced Error Tracking features

{{% collapse-content title="Set tracking consent (GDPR compliance)" level="h4" expanded=false id="set-tracking-consent" %}}

To be compliant with the GDPR regulation, the iOS SDK requires the tracking consent value at initialization.

The `trackingConsent` setting can be one of the following values:

1. `.pending`: The iOS SDK starts collecting and batching the data but does not send it to Datadog. The iOS SDK waits for the new tracking consent value to determine what to do with the batched data.
2. `.granted`: The iOS SDK starts collecting the data and sends it to Datadog.
3. `.notGranted`: The iOS SDK does not collect any data, and doesn't send logs, traces, or events to Datadog.

To **change the tracking consent value** after the iOS SDK is initialized, use the `Datadog.set(trackingConsent:)` API call. The iOS SDK changes its behavior according to the new value.

For example, if the current tracking consent is `.pending`:

- If you change the value to `.granted`, the RUM iOS SDK sends all current and future data to Datadog.
- If you change the value to `.notGranted`, the RUM iOS SDK wipes all current data and does not collect future data.

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Sample session rates" level="h4" expanded=false id="sample-session-rates" %}}

To control the data your application sends to Datadog RUM, you can specify a sampling rate for RUM sessions while [initializing the RUM iOS SDK][19]. The rate is a percentage between 0 and 100. By default, `sessionSamplingRate` is set to 100 (keep all sessions).

For example, to only keep 50% of sessions, use:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Swift" %}}
```swift
let configuration = RUM.Configuration(
    applicationID: "<rum application id>",
    sessionSampleRate: 50
)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Objective-C" %}}
```objective-c
DDRUMConfiguration *configuration = [[DDRUMConfiguration alloc] initWithApplicationID:@"<rum application id>"];
configuration.sessionSampleRate = 50;
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Send data when device is offline" level="h4" expanded=false id="sending-data-device-offline" %}}

The iOS SDK ensures data remains available when an end user's device is offline. In cases of low-network areas, or when the device battery is too low, the device first stores all events in batches. It sends them as soon as the network is available and the battery is high enough to ensure the iOS SDK does not impact the end user's experience. If the network is not available while your application is in the foreground, or if a data upload fails, the device keeps the batch until it can complete a successful upload.

This means that even if users open your application while offline, no data is lost.

**Note**: To ensure the iOS SDK does not use too much disk space, the device automatically discards the data on the disk if the data gets too old.

{{% /collapse-content %}}

{{% collapse-content title="Add watchdog terminations reporting" level="h4" expanded=false id="add-watchdog-terminations-reporting" %}}

In the Apple ecosystem, the operating system employs a watchdog mechanism to monitor the health of applications, and terminates them if they become unresponsive or consume excessive resources like CPU and memory. These watchdog terminations are fatal and not recoverable (more details in the official [Apple documentation][17]).

By default, watchdog terminations reporting is **disabled**, but you can enable it by using the `trackWatchdogTerminations` initialization parameter.

When enabled, a watchdog termination is reported and attached to the previous user session on the next application launch, based on heuristics:

- The application was not upgraded in the meantime,

- And it did not call neither `exit`, nor `abort`,

- And it did not crash, either because of an exception, or because of a fatal [app hang](#step-5---add-app-hang-reporting),

- And it was not force-quitted by the user,

- And the device did not reboot (which includes upgrades of the operating system).

{{< img src="real_user_monitoring/error_tracking/ios-watchdog-termination.png" alt="A watchdog termination in the Error Tracking side panel." style="width:60%;" >}}

#### Enable watchdog terminations reporting

To enable watchdog terminations reporting:

1. [Enable Crash Reporting](#step-4---add-crash-reporting).

2. Update the initialization snippet with the `trackWatchdogTerminations` flag:

    ```swift
    RUM.enable(
        with: RUM.Configuration(
            applicationID: "<application id>",
            trackWatchdogTerminations: true
        )
    )
    ```

#### Disable watchdog terminations reporting

To disable watchdog terminations reporting, update the initialization snippet and set the `trackWatchdogTerminations` parameter to `false`.

## Limitations

- See [Supported versions][20] for a list operating system versions and platforms that are compatible with the iOS SDK.
- `.dSYM` files are limited in size to **2 GB** each.
