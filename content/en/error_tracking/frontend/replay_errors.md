## Overview

As a frontend engineer, an essential and often time-consuming part of the debugging process is reproducing bugs. But it can be difficult to do so without a clear understanding of the actions a user took before your application throws an error.

Error Tracking Replay Snippets allows you to view a pixel-perfect recreation of a user's journey 15 seconds before and after an error occurred so you can reproduce bugs, save time, and eliminate any guesswork.

## Setup

1. If you have not set up Datadog Frontend Error Tracking, follow the [in-app setup instructions][1] or see the setup documentation for [browser][2] and [mobile][3].
2. During SDK initialization, configure your application's replay sample rate. 

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab "Browser" %}}

   Set the `sessionReplaySampleRate` between 1 and 100. 

   ```javascript
   import { datadogRum } from '@datadog/browser-rum';

   datadogRum.init({
      applicationId: '<APP_ID>',
      clientToken: '<CLIENT_TOKEN>',
      service: '<SERVICE>',
      env: '<ENV_NAME>',
      sessionReplaySampleRate: 20,
      trackResources: true,
      trackUserInteractions: true,
   });
   ```

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab "iOS" %}}

   {{% /tab %}}
   {{</tabs>}}

## Replay errors
After reviewing key information about the error, such as the error message and stack trace, you can immediately pivot directly from the issue summary to a live reproduction of the most recent session that experienced the error. Scroll down below the stack trace and click on the preview of the replay to see a users actions before the error occured.
