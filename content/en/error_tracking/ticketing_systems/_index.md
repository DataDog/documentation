## Overview

Datadog Error Tracking integrates with your existing ticketing workflows to streamline issue resolution.
Link Error Tracking issues to Jira tickets or Case Management cases to track and resolve errors within your established processes.

With ticketing system integrations, you can:

- **Create tickets directly from issues**: Open Jira tickets or Case Management cases from the Error Tracking issue panel to centralize investigation efforts.
- **Group multiple issues into a single ticket**: Attach several related Error Tracking issues to one ticket or case, consolidating correlated issues into a single unit of work.
- **Automate ticket creation**: Configure rules to automatically create tickets in specific Jira boards or Case Management projects when issues match specific criteria.

These features help your teams respond to errors faster by bridging the gap between error detection and resolution workflows.
