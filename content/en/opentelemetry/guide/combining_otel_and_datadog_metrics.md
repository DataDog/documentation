Datadog and OpenTelemetry (OTel) use different naming conventions for integration metrics. This guide explains how to combine metrics from both systems in a single query using Datadog's `equiv_otel` function.

## Challenges when combining metrics

When working with both Datadog and OTel metrics, two main challenges arise. Let's examine these using NGINX connection monitoring as an example:

### Different naming conventions

Datadog and OTel handle the same measurements differently:
- Datadog: `nginx.net.connections` (a specific metric for active connections)
- OTel: `nginx.connections_current` (captures all connection states in a single metric)
  - Requires filtering with `state:active` to match Datadog's active connections metric

### Aggregation limitations

Simply combining separate metric queries can lead to incorrect results. For example, if you try to combine these queries:
```
avg:nginx.net.connections
avg:nginx.connections_current{state:active}
```
You get an average of averages, not the true average across all timeseries. This happens because traditional [metrics functions][1] combine the results of separate queries rather than treating the data as a single metric.

## Combining metrics with the equiv_otel function

The `equiv_otel` function automatically combines equivalent Datadog and OTel metrics in a single query. It:

- Automatically handles metric name translation
- Properly aggregates all timeseries as a single metric
- Works bidirectionally (Datadog to OTel or OTel to Datadog)
- Preserves query aggregation semantics

### Converting from Datadog to OTel

To include the equivalent OTel metrics in your query, wrap your Datadog query in `equiv_otel`:

```
equiv_otel(avg:nginx.net.connections)
```
This query:
1. Identifies the equivalent OTel metric (`nginx.connections_current{state:active}`)
2. Combines timeseries from both metrics
3. Applies the aggregation (`avg`) across all datapoints

### Converting from OTel to Datadog

The same works for including Datadog metrics in an OTel query:

```
equiv_otel(avg:nginx.connections_current{state:active})
```
The function works the same way in reverse, automatically including the equivalent Datadog metric (`nginx.net.connections`).
