{{< callout url="" header="false" btn_hidden="true" >}}
  Datadog Connector for the OpenTelemetry Collector is in beta. 
{{< /callout >}} 

## Overview

If you use the soon-to-be deprecated [Datadog Processor][1] in your OpenTelemetry Collector pipeline for APM metrics, switch to use [Datadog Connector][2] instead. The Datadog Connector allows APM metrics to be calculated on 100% of the trace data, even when sampling is applied. 

The Datadog Connector also complies better with the OpenTelemetry standard than the Datadog Processor.

## Switch your Agent OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

To switch to using the Datadog Connector, change the following Agent configurations:

1. Add the `connectors` section.
{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=7-14" >}}
processors:
   probabilistic_sampler:
     sampling_percentage: 20
     # Add the "datadog" processor definition
  datadog:

# Add this section
 connectors:
  # Add the Datadog Connector definition and further configurations
    datadog/connector:
 exporters:
    datadog:
      api:
        key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}
{{< /highlight >}}

2. Duplicate the `service.pipelines.trace` configuration so one can be sampled and the other can be used for APM stats.
3. Add the Datadog Connector configuration to the duplicated pipeline that isn't sampled:
     {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=3-6" >}}
     service:
       pipelines:
         traces:
           receivers: [otlp]
           processors: [batch]
           exporters: [datadog/connector]
         traces/2: # This duplicated pipeline uses sampling
           receivers: [otlp]
           processors: [batch, probabilistic_sampler]
           exporters: [datadog]
     {{< /highlight >}}
4. Add the Connector configuration to `metrics` pipeline section:
   ```yaml
       metrics:
         receivers: [datadog/connector]
         processors: [batch]
         exporters: [datadog]
   ```

### Example

The Connector transmits the APM stats that are generated by the traces. In the following full example, the `traces/2` pipeline samples the traces, and the `traces` pipeline doesn't. The Datadog Connector ensures the resulting number of stats are accurate.

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 20

connectors:
  # Add the "datadog" connector definition and further configurations
   datadog/connector:

exporters:
  datadog:
      api:
        key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}

service:
  pipelines:
     traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [datadog/connector]

     traces/2: # This pipeline uses sampling
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch, probabilistic_sampler]
        exporters: [datadog]

     metrics:
        receivers: [datadog/connector]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [datadog]
```
