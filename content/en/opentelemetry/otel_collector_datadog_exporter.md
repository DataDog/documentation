The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent process for collecting and exporting telemetry data emitted by many processes. The [Datadog Exporter][1] for the OpenTelemetry Collector allows you to forward trace, metric, and logs data from OpenTelemetry SDKs on to Datadog (without the Datadog Agent). It works with all supported languages, and you can [connect those OpenTelemetry trace data with application logs][2].

## Setting up the OTel Collector with the Datadog Exporter

To run the OpenTelemetry Collector along with the Datadog Exporter:

### 1. Download the OpenTelemetry Collector

Download the latest release of the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution, from [the project's repository][3].

### 2. Configure the Datadog Exporter

To use the Datadog Exporter, add it to your [OpenTelemetry Collector configuration][4]. Create a configuration file and name it `collector.yaml`. Use the example file which provides a basic configuration that is ready to use after you set your Datadog API key as the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable:

{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="collector.yaml" collapsible="true" >}}
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
      grpc:
  # The hostmetrics receiver is required to get correct infrastructure metrics in Datadog.
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    scrapers:
      paging:
        metrics:
          system.paging.utilization:
            enabled: true
      cpu:
        metrics:
          system.cpu.utilization:
            enabled: true
      disk:
      filesystem:
        metrics:
          system.filesystem.utilization:
            enabled: true
      load:
      memory:
      network:
      processes:
  # The prometheus receiver scrapes metrics needed for the OpenTelemetry Collector Dashboard.
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'otelcol'
        scrape_interval: 10s
        static_configs:
        - targets: ['0.0.0.0:8888']

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_max_size: 100
    send_batch_size: 10
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  datadog:
    api:
      site: <DD_SITE>
      key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics, otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [datadog]
{{< /code-block >}}

Where `<DD_SITE>` is your site, {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}.

The above configuration enables the receiving of OTLP data from OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries over HTTP and gRPC, and sets up a [batch processor][5], which is mandatory for any non-development environment. Note that you may get `413 - Request Entity Too Large` errors if you batch too much telemetry data in the batch processor.

The exact configuration of the batch processor depends on your specific workload as well as the signal types. Datadog intake has different payload size limits for the 3 signal types:
- Trace intake: 3.2MB
- Log intake: [5MB uncompressed][15]
- Metrics V2 intake: [500KB or 5MB after decompression][16]

#### Advanced configuration

[This fully documented example configuration file][6] illustrates all possible configuration options for the Datadog Exporter. There may be other options relevant to your deployment, such as `api::site` or the ones on the `host_metadata` section.

### 3. Configure your application

To get better metadata for traces and for smooth integration with Datadog:

- **Use resource detectors**: If they are provided by the language SDK, attach container information as resource attributes. For example, in Go, use the [`WithContainer()`][7] resource option.

- **Apply [Unified Service Tagging][8]**: Make sure youâ€™ve configured your application with the appropriate resource attributes for unified service tagging. This ties Datadog telemetry together with tags for service name, deployment environment, and service version. The application should set these tags using the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions: `service.name`, `deployment.environment`, and `service.version`.

### 4. Run the collector

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "On a host" %}}

Run the collector, specifying the configuration file using the `--config` parameter:

```
otelcontribcol_linux_amd64 --config collector.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Docker (localhost)" %}}
To run the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Docker image and receive traces from the same host:

1. Choose a published Docker image such as [`otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`][1].

2. Determine which ports to open on your container so that OpenTelemetry traces are sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector. By default, traces are sent over gRPC on port 4317. If you don't use gRPC, use port 4138.

3. Run the container and expose the necessary port, using the previously defined `collector.yaml` file. For example, considering you are using port 4317:

   ```
   $ docker run \
       -p 4317:4317 \
       --hostname $(hostname) \
       -v $(pwd)/otel_collector_config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
       otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
   ```


[1]: https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tags
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Docker (other containers)" %}}

To run the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Docker image and receive traces from other containers:

1. Create a Docker network:

    ```
    docker network create <NETWORK_NAME>
    ```

2. Run the OpenTelemetry Collector and application containers as part of the same network.

   ```
   # Run the OpenTelemetry Collector
   docker run -d --name opentelemetry-collector \
       --network <NETWORK_NAME> \
       --hostname $(hostname) \
       -v $(pwd)/otel_collector_config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
       otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
   ```

   When running the application container, ensure that the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is configured to use the appropriate hostname for the OpenTelemetry Collector. In the example below, this is `opentelemetry-collector`.

   ```
   # Run the application container
   docker run -d --name app \
       --network <NETWORK_NAME> \
       --hostname $(hostname) \
       -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://opentelemetry-collector:4317 \
       company/app:latest
   ```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes (DaemonSet)" %}}

Using a DaemonSet is the most common and recommended way to configure OTel collection in a Kubernetes environment. To deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and Datadog Exporter in a Kubernetes infrastructure:

1. Use this [full example of configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector using the Datadog Exporter as a DaemonSet][1], including the application configuration example.

   Note especially some [essential configuration options from the example][2], which ensure the essential ports of the DaemonSet are exposed and accessible to your application:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           ports:
           - containerPort: 4318 # default port for OpenTelemetry HTTP receiver.
             hostPort: 4318
           - containerPort: 4317 # default port for OpenTelemetry gRPC receiver.
             hostPort: 4317
           - containerPort: 8888  # Default endpoint for querying Collector observability metrics.
   # ...
   ```

   If you do not need both the standard HTTP and gRPC ports for your application, it is fine to remove them.

2. Collect valuable Kubernetes attributes, which are used for Datadog container tagging, report the Pod IP as a resource attribute, [as shown in the example][3]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: POD_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.podIP
           # The k8s.pod.ip is used to associate pods for k8sattributes
           - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
             value: "k8s.pod.ip=$(POD_IP)"
   # ...
   ```

   This ensures that [Kubernetes Attributes Processor][4] which is used in [the config map][5] is able to extract the necessary metadata to attach to traces. There are additional [roles][6] that need to be set to allow access to this metadata. [The example][1] is complete, ready to use, and has the correct roles set up.
  
3. Provide your [application container][7]. To configure your application container, ensure that the correct OTLP endpoint hostname is used. The OpenTelemetry Collector runs as a DaemonSet, so the current host needs to be targeted. Set your application container's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable correctly, as in the [example chart][8]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: HOST_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.hostIP
             # The application SDK must use this environment variable in order to successfully
             # connect to the DaemonSet's collector.
           - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
             value: "http://$(HOST_IP):4318"
   # ...
   ```

{{% tab "Kubernetes (Gateway)" %}}

To deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and Datadog Exporter in a Kubernetes Gateway deployment:

1. Use this [full example of configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector using the Datadog Exporter as a DaemonSet][1], including the application configuration example.

   Note especially some [essential configuration options from the example][2], which ensure the essential ports of the DaemonSet are exposed and accessible to your application:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           ports:
           - containerPort: 4318 # default port for OpenTelemetry HTTP receiver.
             hostPort: 4318
           - containerPort: 4317 # default port for OpenTelemetry gRPC receiver.
             hostPort: 4317
           - containerPort: 8888  # Default endpoint for querying Collector observability metrics.
   # ...
   ```

   If you do not need both the standard HTTP and gRPC ports for your application, it is fine to remove them.

2. Collect valuable Kubernetes attributes, which are used for Datadog container tagging, report the Pod IP as a resource attribute, [as shown in the example][3]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: POD_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.podIP
           # The k8s.pod.ip is used to associate pods for k8sattributes
           - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
             value: "k8s.pod.ip=$(POD_IP)"
   # ...
   ```

   This ensures that [Kubernetes Attributes Processor][4] which is used in [the config map][5] is able to extract the necessary metadata to attach to traces. There are additional [roles][6] that need to be set to allow access to this metadata. [The example][1] is complete, ready to use, and has the correct roles set up.
  
3. Provide your [application container][7]. To configure your application container, ensure that the correct OTLP endpoint hostname is used. The OpenTelemetry Collector runs as a DaemonSet, so the current host needs to be targeted. Set your application container's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable correctly, as in the [example chart][8]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: HOST_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.hostIP
             # The application SDK must use this environment variable in order to successfully
             # connect to the DaemonSet's collector.
           - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
             value: "http://$(HOST_IP):4318"
   # ...
   ```

4. Change the DaemonSet to include an [OTLP exporter][9] instead of the Datadog Exporter [currently in place][10]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
   exporters:
     otlp:
       endpoint: "<GATEWAY_HOSTNAME>:4317"
   # ...
   ```

5. Make sure that the service pipelines use this exporter, instead of the Datadog one that [is in place in the example][11]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
       service:
         pipelines:
           metrics:
             receivers: [hostmetrics, otlp]
             processors: [resourcedetection, k8sattributes, batch]
             exporters: [otlp]
           traces:
             receivers: [otlp]
             processors: [resourcedetection, k8sattributes, batch]
             exporters: [otlp]
   # ...
   ```

   This ensures that each agent forwards its data via the OTLP protocol to the Collector Gateway. 

6. Replace `GATEWAY_HOSTNAME` with the address of your OpenTelemetry Collector Gateway.

7. To ensure that Kubernetes metadata continues to be applied to traces, tell the [`k8sattributes` processor][12] to forward the Pod IP to the Gateway Collector so that it can obtain the metadata:

   ```yaml
   # ...
   k8sattributes:
     passthrough: true
   # ...
   ```

   For more information about the `passthrough` option, read [its documentation][13].

8. Make sure that the Gateway Collector's configuration uses the same Datadog Exporter settings that have been replaced by the OTLP exporter in the agents. For example (where `<DD_SITE>` is your site, {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}):

   ```yaml
   # ...
   exporters:
     datadog:
       api:
         site: <DD_SITE>
         key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}
   # ...
   ```

To use the OpenTelemetry Operator:

1. Follow the [official documentation for deploying the OpenTelemetry Operator][1]. As described there, deploy the certificate manager in addition to the Operator.

2. Configure the Operator using one of the OpenTelemetry Collector standard Kubernetes configurations:
   * [Daemonset deployment][2] - Use the DaemonSet deployment if you want to ensure you receive host metrics. 
   * [Gateway deployment][3]

   For example:

{{% tab "Alongside the Agent" %}}

To use the OpenTelemetry Collector alongside the Datadog Agent:

1. Set up an additional DaemonSet to ensure that the Datadog Agent runs on each host alongside the previously set up [OpenTelemetry Collector DaemonSet][1]. For information, read [the docs about deploying the Datadog Agent in Kubernetes][2].

2. Enable [OTLP ingestion in the Datadog Agent][3].

3. Now that the Datadog Agent is ready to receive OTLP traces and metrics, change your [OpenTelemetry Collector DaemonSet][1] to use the [OTLP exporter][4] instead of the Datadog Exporter by adding the following configuration to [your config map][5]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
   exporters:
     otlp:
       endpoint: "${HOST_IP}:4317"
       tls:
         insecure: true
   # ...
   ```

4. Make sure that the `HOST_IP` environment variable is provided [in the DaemonSet][6]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: HOST_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.hostIP
   # ...
   ```

5. Make sure that the [service pipelines][7] are using OTLP:

   ```yaml
   # ...
       service:
         pipelines:
           metrics:
             receivers: [otlp]
             processors: [resourcedetection, k8sattributes, batch]
             exporters: [otlp]
           traces:
             receivers: [otlp]
             processors: [resourcedetection, k8sattributes, batch]
             exporters: [otlp]

   In this case, don't use the `hostmetrics` receiver because those metrics will be emitted by the Datadog Agent.

### Host name resolution

The host name that OpenTelemetry signals are tagged with is obtained based on the following sources in order, falling back to the next one if the current one is unavailable or invalid:

1. From [resource attributes][9], for example `host.name` (many others are supported).
2. The `hostname` field in the exporter configuration.
3. Cloud provider API.
4. Kubernetes host name.
5. Fully qualified domain name.
6. Operating system host name.

## Deployment-based limitations

The OpenTelemetry Collector has [two primary deployment methods][14]: Agent and Gateway. Depending on your deployment method, some components are not available.

| Deployment mode | Host metrics | Kubernetes orchestration metrics | Traces | Logs auto-ingestion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| as Gateway | | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | |
| as Agent | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} |
