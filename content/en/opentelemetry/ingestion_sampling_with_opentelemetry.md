## Overview

OpenTelemetry SDKs and the OpenTelemetry Collector provide sampling capabilities, as ingesting 100% of traces is often unnecessary to gain visibility into the health of your applications. Configure sampling rates before sending traces to Datadog to ingest data that is most relevant to your business and observability goals, while controlling and managing overall costs.

This document demonstrates two primary methods for sending traces to Datadog with OpenTelemetry:

- Send traces to the **[OpenTelemetry Collector][1]**, and use the Datadog Exporter to forward them to Datadog.
- Send traces to the **[Datadog Agent OTLP ingest][3]**, which forwards them to Datadog.

**Note**: Datadog doesn't support running the OpenTelemetry Collector and the Datadog Agent on the same host.

### Using the OpenTelemetry Collector

With this method, the OpenTelemetry Collector receives traces from OpenTelemetry SDKs and exports them to Datadog using the Datadog Exporter. In this scenario, [APM trace metrics][4] are computed by the Datadog Connector:

{{< img src="/opentelemetry/guide/ingestion_otel/otel_apm_metrics_computation_collector.png" alt="OpenTelemetry APM Metrics computation using the Collector" style="width:100%;" >}}

Choose this method if you require the advanced processing capabilities of the OpenTelemetry Collector, such as tail-based sampling. To configure the Collector to receive traces, follow the instructions on [OpenTelemetry Collector and Datadog Exporter][16].

### Using Datadog Agent OTLP ingestion

With this method, the Datadog Agent receives traces directly from OpenTelemetry SDKs using the OTLP protocol. This allows you to send traces to Datadog without running a separate OpenTelemetry Collector service. In this scenario, APM trace metrics are computed by the Agent:

{{< img src="/opentelemetry/guide/ingestion_otel/otel_apm_metrics_computation_agent.png" alt="OpenTelemetry APM Metrics computation using the Datadog Agent" style="width:100%;" >}}

Choose this method if you prefer a simpler setup without the need for a separate OpenTelemetry Collector service. To configure the Datadog Agent to receive traces using OTLP, follow the instructions on [OTLP Ingestion by the Datadog Agent][15].

## Reducing ingestion volume

With OpenTelemetry, you can configure sampling both in the OpenTelemetry libraries and in the OpenTelemetry Collector: 

- **Head-based sampling** in the OpenTelemetry SDKs
- **Tail-based sampling** in the OpenTelemetry Collector
- **Probabilistic sampling** in the Datadog Agent

### Head-based sampling

At the SDK level, you can implement _head-based sampling_. This is when the sampling decision is made at the beginning of the trace. This type of sampling is particularly useful for high-throughput applications, where you have a clear understanding of which traces are most important to ingest and want to make sampling decisions early in the tracing process.

#### Configuring

To configure head-based sampling, use the [TraceIdRatioBased][5] or [ParentBased][6] samplers provided by the OpenTelemetry SDKs. These allow you to implement deterministic head-based sampling based on the `trace_id` at the SDK level.

#### Considerations

Head-based sampling affects the computation of APM metrics. Only sampled traces are sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector or Datadog Agent, which perform metrics computation.

To approximate unsampled metrics from sampled metrics, use [formulas and functions][7] with the sampling rate configured in the SDK.

Use the [ingestion volume control guide][8] to read more about the implications of setting up trace sampling on trace analytics monitors and metrics from spans.


### Tail-based sampling

At the OpenTelemetry Collector level, you can do _tail-based sampling_, which allows you to define more advanced rules to maintain visibility over traces with errors or high latency.

#### Configuring

To configure tail-based sampling, use the [Tail Sampling Processor][9] or [Probabilistic Sampling Processor][10] to sample traces based on a set of rules at the collector level.

#### Considerations

A limitation of tail-based sampling is that all spans for a given trace must be received by the same collector instance for effective sampling decisions. If a trace is distributed across multiple collector instances, and tail-based sampling is used, some parts of that trace may not be sent to Datadog.

To ensure that APM metrics are computed based on 100% of the applications' traffic while using collector-level tail-based sampling, use the [Datadog Connector][11].

<div class="alert alert-info">The Datadog Connector is available starting v0.83.0. Read <a href="/opentelemetry/guide/switch_from_processor_to_connector">Switch from Datadog Processor to Datadog Connector for OpenTelemetry APM Metrics</a> if migrating from an older version.</div>

See the [ingestion volume control guide][8] for information about the implications of setting up trace sampling on trace analytics monitors and metrics from spans.

### Probabilistic sampling

When using Datadog Agent OTLP ingest, a probabilistic sampler is available starting with Agent v7.44.0. 

#### Configuring

To configure probabilistic sampling, either:

- Set the `DD_OTLP_CONFIG_TRACES_PROBABILISTIC_SAMPLER_SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE` environment variable, or
- Add the following YAML to your Agent's configuration file:

  ```yaml
  otlp_config:
    # ...
    traces:
      probabilistic_sampler:
        sampling_percentage: 50 #In this example, 50% of traces are captured.
  ```
#### Considerations

The probabilistic sampler ignores spans for which the sampling priority is set at the SDK level. Spans not captured by the probabilistic sampler may still be captured by the Datadog Agent's [error and rare samplers][12].

## Monitoring ingested volumes in Datadog

Use the [APM Estimated Usage dashboard][13] and the `datadog.estimated_usage.apm.ingested_bytes` metric to get visibility into your ingested volumes over a specific time period. Filter the dashboard to specific environments and services to see which services are responsible for the largest shares of the ingested volume.

If the ingestion volume is higher than expected, consider adjusting your sampling rates.
