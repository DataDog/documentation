## Overview

This page provides guides for installing and configuring a standalone OpenTelemetry Collector to send telemetry data to Datadog.

This method is best for users who prefer to use OTel Collector distributions from the OpenTelemetry open source community or require advanced processing capabilities not available in other setups. For most use cases the [Datadog Distribution of OTel Collector (DDOT)][1] is the recommended approach.

## Setup

To begin, install the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it with the Datadog Exporter. This guide walks you through the initial setup required before proceeding to more specific configuration topics.
