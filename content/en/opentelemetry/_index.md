## Overview

[OpenTelemetry][1] (OTel) provides standardized protocols for collecting and routing telemetry data. Datadog supports multiple ways to collect and analyze telemetry data from OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications, whether you're using existing Datadog infrastructure or prefer a vendor-neutral setup.

### Why OpenTelemetry with Datadog?

Datadog provides advanced observability for all your application telemetry, regardless of its source. By supporting OpenTelemetry, Datadog offers:

- **Flexibility and choice**: Use standardized instrumentation while maintaining freedom to adapt as your technology needs evolve.
- **Comprehensive language support**: Consistently monitor applications across your entire tech stack.
- **Unified instrumentation**: Maintain a single approach to instrumentation across your systems.
- **Powerful analytics**: Combine OpenTelemetry's standardization with Datadog's robust analysis, visualization, and alerting capabilities.

Whether you're already using OpenTelemetry or considering adoption, Datadog provides flexible options to meet your needs.

### Key decisions

There are two key decisions to make when using OpenTelemetry with Datadog:

- [How to instrument your applications](#instrument-your-applications)
- [How to send your data to Datadog](#send-opentelemetry-data-to-datadog)

The features available to you depend on these choices. For example, using the OpenTelemetry API with the Datadog SDK provides access to more Datadog features than using the OpenTelemetry SDK alone.

For more information, read [Feature Compatibility][9].

## Instrument your applications

There are several ways to instrument your applications with OpenTelemetry and Datadog. Each approach provides different features and levels of vendor neutrality.

- **Full OpenTelemetry**: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK and API for a vendor-neutral setup.
- **OpenTelemetry API**: Use the OpenTelemetry API with Datadog's SDK implementation.
- **OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries**: Extend Datadog's observability to additional frameworks and technologies.

For more information, see [Instrument Your Applications][8]. 

## Send OpenTelemetry data to Datadog

If your applications and services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry libraries, you can choose how to get traces, metrics, and logs data into Datadog.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Not sure which setup is right for you?</strong><br> See the <a href="/opentelemetry/compatibility/">Feature Compatibility</a> table to understand which Datadog features are supported.</div>

### Option 1: Use the OpenTelemetry Collector

{{< img src="/opentelemetry/setup/otel-collector.png" alt="Diagram: OpenTelemetry SDK in code sends data through OTLP to host running OpenTelemetry Collector with Datadog Exporter, which forwards to Datadog's Observability Platform." style="width:100%;" >}}

**Best for**: New or existing OTel users wanting a completely vendor-neutral setup.

- Complete vendor neutrality for sending OpenTelemetry data to Datadog
- Flexible configuration options like tail-based sampling and data transformations

{{< /whatsnext >}}

### Option 2: Use the Datadog Agent

{{< img src="/opentelemetry/setup/dd-agent-otlp-ingest.png" alt="Diagram: OpenTelemetry SDK sends data through OTLP protocol directly to the Datadog Agent, which forwards to Datadog's platform." style="width:100%;" >}}

**Best for**: Existing Datadog users or teams requiring Agent-based features such as:

- Fleet Automation
- Live Container Monitoring
- Kubernetes Explorer
- Live Processes
- Cloud Network Monitoring
- Universal Service Monitoring
- {{< translate key="integration_count" >}}+ Datadog integrations

<div class="alert alert-info">For a complete list of Agent-based features, see <strong>OTel to Datadog Agent (OTLP)</strong> in <a href="/opentelemetry/compatibility/">Feature Compatibility</a>.</div>
