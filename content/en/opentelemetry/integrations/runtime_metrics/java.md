## Prerequisites

- You are successfully [sending OpenTelemetry metrics to Datadog][1].
- You have installed the language integration for [Java][2].

## OpenTelemetry SDK configuration

If you have instrumented your Java applications with [OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation][3], runtime metrics are automatically enabled.

If you have instrumented your Java application with [OpenTelemetry manual instrumentation][4], see the following guides for your Java version:
- [Java 8][5]
- [Java 17][6]

## Runtime metric mappings

The following table lists the Datadog runtime metrics that are supported by mapping OpenTelemetry runtime metrics, with "N/A" indicating that there is no OpenTelemetry counterpart.

| Datadog metric | Description |  OpenTelemetry counterpart |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jvm.heap_memory` | The total Java heap memory used. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage` |
| `jvm.heap_memory_committed` | The total Java heap memory committed to be used. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.committed` |
| `jvm.heap_memory_init` | The initial Java heap memory allocated. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.init` |
| `jvm.heap_memory_max` | The maximum Java heap memory available. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.limit` |
| `jvm.non_heap_memory` | The total Java non-heap memory used. Non-heap memory is: `Metaspace + CompressedClassSpace + CodeCache`. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage` |
| `jvm.non_heap_memory_committed` | The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.committed` |
| `jvm.non_heap_memory_init` | The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.init` |
| `jvm.non_heap_memory_max` | The maximum Java non-heap memory available. | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.limit` |
| `jvm.gc.old_gen_size` | | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage` |
| `jvm.gc.eden_size` | | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage` |
| `jvm.gc.survivor_size` | | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage` |
| `jvm.gc.metaspace_size` | | `process.runtime.jvm.memory.usage` |
| `jvm.thread_count` | The number of live threads. | `process.runtime.jvm.threads.count` |
| `jvm.loaded_classes` | Number of classes currently loaded. | `process.runtime.jvm.classes.current_loaded` |
| `jvm.cpu_load.system` | Recent CPU utilization for the whole system. | `process.runtime.jvm.system.cpu.utilization` |
| `jvm.cpu_load.process` | Recent CPU utilization for the process. | `process.runtime.jvm.cpu.utilization` |
| `jvm.buffer_pool.direct.used` | Measure of memory used by direct buffers. | `process.runtime.jvm.buffer.usage` |
| `jvm.buffer_pool.direct.count` | Number of direct buffers in the pool. | `process.runtime.jvm.buffer.count` |
| `jvm.buffer_pool.direct.capacity` | Measure of total memory capacity of direct buffers. | `process.runtime.jvm.buffer.limit` |
| `jvm.buffer_pool.mapped.used` | Measure of memory used by mapped buffers. | `process.runtime.jvm.buffer.usage` |
| `jvm.buffer_pool.mapped.count` | Number of mapped buffers in the pool. | `process.runtime.jvm.buffer.count` |
| `jvm.buffer_pool.mapped.capacity` | Measure of total memory capacity of mapped buffers. | `process.runtime.jvm.buffer.limit` |
| `jvm.gc.parnew.time` | The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. | `process.runtime.jvm.gc.duration` |
|	`jvm.gc.cms.count` | The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. | N/A |
|	`jvm.gc.major_collection_count` | The rate of major garbage collections. Set `new_gc_metrics: true` to receive this metric. | N/A |
|	`jvm.gc.minor_collection_count` | The rate of minor garbage collections. Set `new_gc_metrics: true` to receive this metric. | N/A |
|	`jvm.gc.major_collection_time` | The fraction of time spent in major garbage collection. Set `new_gc_metrics: true` to receive this metric. | N/A |
|	`jvm.gc.minor_collection_time` | The fraction of time spent in minor garbage collection. Set `new_gc_metrics: true` to receive this metric. | N/A |
|	`jvm.os.open_file_descriptors` | | N/A |
