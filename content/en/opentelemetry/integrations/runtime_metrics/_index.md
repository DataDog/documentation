## Overview

Runtime metrics provide insights into application performance, including memory usage, garbage collection, and parallelization. Datadog tracing libraries offer [runtime metrics collection][5] for each supported language, and OpenTelemetry (OTel) also collects compatible runtime metrics that can be sent to Datadog through the OpenTelemetry SDKs.

## Compatibility

Datadog supports OpenTelemetry runtime metrics for the following languages:
- Java
- .NET
- Go

For details about host and container metrics mapping, see [OpenTelemetry Metrics Mapping][1].

## Setup instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- You have successfully [configured OpenTelemetry metrics to send to Datadog][2].
- You have installed the [corresponding language integration in Datadog][3].

### 2. Configure your application

Select your language to see instructions for configuring the OpenTelemetry SDK to send runtime metrics:

#### Automatic instrumentation

If you use [OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation][3] for Java applications, runtime metrics are enabled by default.

#### Manual instrumentation

If you use [OpenTelemetry manual instrumentation][4], follow the guides for your Java version:
- [Java 8][5]
- [Java 17][6]

OpenTelemetry Go applications are [instrumented manually][3]. To enable runtime metrics, see the documentation for the [runtime package][4].

<div class="alert bg-light">

<div class="alert alert-warning">The minimum supported version of the .NET OpenTelemetry SDK is <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/releases/tag/core-1.5.0">1.5.0</a></div>

#### Automatic instrumentation

If you use [OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation][3] for .NET applications, runtime metrics are enabled by default.

#### Manual instrumentation

If you use [OpenTelemetry manual instrumentation][4], see the documentation for the [OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime library][5].

#### Metric export interval

The default metric export interval for the .NET OTel SDK differs from the default for the Datadog .NET SDK. Datadog recommends setting the [OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL][7] environment variable on your .NET service to match the default Datadog metric export interval:

```
OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=10000
```

## View runtime metric dashboards

After setup is complete, you can view runtime metrics in:
- The service's details page (see Java example below)
- The flame graph metrics tab
- Default [runtime dashboards][7]

## Data collected

When using OpenTelemetry runtime metrics with Datadog, you receive both:
- Original OpenTelemetry runtime metrics
- Mapped Datadog runtime metrics for equivalent metrics

The OpenTelemetry runtime metrics have the following prefixes based on their source:

| Source | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| [OTel Collector Datadog Exporter][100] | `otel.process.runtime.*` |
| [Datadog Agent OTLP Ingest][101] | `process.runtime.*` |

The following tables list the Datadog runtime metrics that are supported through OpenTelemetry mapping. "N/A" indicates that there is no OpenTelemetry equivalent metric available.

<div class="alert alert-warning"> OpenTelemetry runtime metrics are mapped to Datadog by metric name. Do not rename host metrics for OpenTelemetry runtime metrics as this breaks the mapping.</div>
