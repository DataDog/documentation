## Overview

{{< img src="/opentelemetry/collector_exporter/collector_health_metrics.png" alt="OpenTelemetry Collector health metrics dashboard" style="width:100%;" >}}

To collect health metrics from the OpenTelemetry Collector itself, configure the [Prometheus receiver][1] in your Datadog Exporter.

For more information, see the OpenTelemetry project documentation for the [Prometheus receiver][1].

## Setup

Add the following lines to your Collector configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'otelcol'
        scrape_interval: 10s
        static_configs:
        - targets: ['0.0.0.0:8888']
```

## Data collected

| OpenTelemetry Metric | Description |

| `otelcol_process_uptime` | Uptime of the process |
| `otelcol_process_memory_rss` | Total physical memory (resident set size) |
| `otelcol_exporter_queue_size` | Current size of the retry queue (in batches) |
| `otelcol_exporter_sent_spans` | Number of spans successfully sent to destination |
| `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points` | Number of metric points in failed attempts to send to destination |
| `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans` | Number of spans in failed attempts to send to destination |
| `otelcol_process_cpu_seconds` | Total CPU user and system time in seconds |
| `otelcol_receiver_refused_spans` | Number of spans that could not be pushed into the pipeline |
| `otelcol_exporter_queue_capacity` | Fixed capacity of the retry queue (in batches) |
| `otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans` | Number of spans successfully pushed into the pipeline |
| `otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points` | Number of metric points successfully sent to destination |
| `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_spans` | Number of spans failed to be added to the sending queue |
| `otelcol_scraper_errored_metric_points` | Number of metric points that were unable to be scraped |
| `otelcol_scraper_scraped_metric_points` | Number of metric points successfully scraped |
| `otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points` | Number of metric points that could not be pushed into the pipeline |
| `otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points` | Number of metric points successfully pushed into the pipeline |
| `otelcol_process_runtime_heap_alloc_bytes` | Bytes of allocated heap objects (see 'go doc runtime.MemStats.HeapAlloc') |
| `otelcol_process_runtime_total_alloc_bytes` | Cumulative bytes allocated for heap objects (see 'go doc runtime.MemStats.TotalAlloc') |
| `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_log_records` | Number of log records failed to be added to the sending queue |
| `otelcol_processor_batch_timeout_trigger_send` | Number of times the batch was sent due to a timeout trigger |
| `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_metric_points` | Number of metric points failed to be added to the sending queue |
| `otelcol_process_runtime_total_sys_memory_bytes` | Total bytes of memory obtained from the OS (see [the Go docs for `runtime.MemStats.Sys`][3]) |
| `otelcol_processor_batch_batch_size_trigger_send` | Number of times the batch was sent due to a size trigger |
| `otelcol_exporter_sent_log_records` | Number of log records successfully sent to destination |
| `otelcol_receiver_refused_log_records` | Number of log records that could not be pushed into the pipeline |
| `otelcol_receiver_accepted_log_records` | Number of log records successfully pushed into the pipeline |
