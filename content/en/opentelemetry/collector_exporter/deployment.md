## Downloading the collector

To run the OpenTelemetry Collector along with the Datadog Exporter, download the latest release of the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution][3]. 

## Running the collector

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "On a host" %}}

Run the collector, specifying the configuration file using the `--config` parameter:

```
otelcontribcol_linux_amd64 --config collector.yaml
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Docker (localhost)" %}}
To run the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Docker image and receive traces from the same host:

1. Choose a published Docker image such as [`otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`][1].

2. Determine which ports to open on your container so that OpenTelemetry traces are sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector. By default, traces are sent over gRPC on port 4317. If you don't use gRPC, use port 4318.

3. Run the container and expose the necessary port, using the `collector.yaml` file. For example, if you are using port 4317:

   ```
   $ docker run \
       -p 4317:4317 \
       --hostname $(hostname) \
       -v $(pwd)/otel_collector_config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
       otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
   ```


[1]: https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tags
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Docker (other containers)" %}}

To run the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Docker image and receive traces from other containers:

1. Create a Docker network:

    ```
    docker network create <NETWORK_NAME>
    ```

2. Run the OpenTelemetry Collector and application containers as part of the same network.

   ```
   # Run the OpenTelemetry Collector
   docker run -d --name opentelemetry-collector \
       --network <NETWORK_NAME> \
       --hostname $(hostname) \
       -v $(pwd)/otel_collector_config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
       otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
   ```

   When running the application container, ensure that the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is configured to use the appropriate hostname for the OpenTelemetry Collector. In the example below, this is `opentelemetry-collector`.

   ```
   # Run the application container
   docker run -d --name app \
       --network <NETWORK_NAME> \
       --hostname $(hostname) \
       -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://opentelemetry-collector:4317 \
       company/app:latest
   ```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes (DaemonSet)" %}}

Using a DaemonSet is the most common and recommended way to configure OpenTelemetry collection in a Kubernetes environment. To deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and Datadog Exporter in a Kubernetes infrastructure:

1. Use this [full example of configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector using the Datadog Exporter as a DaemonSet][1], including the application configuration example.

   [Some configuration options in the example][2] (repeated below) ensure that essential ports of the DaemonSet are exposed and accessible to your application:

   ```yaml
   # ...
        ports:
        - containerPort: 4318 # default port for OpenTelemetry HTTP receiver.
          hostPort: 4318
        - containerPort: 4317 # default port for OpenTelemetry gRPC receiver.
          hostPort: 4317
        - containerPort: 8888  # Default endpoint for querying Collector observability metrics.
   # ...
   ```

   If you do not need both the standard HTTP and gRPC ports for your application, you can remove the corresponding configuration options.

2. To collect valuable Kubernetes attributes, which are used for Datadog container tagging, report the Pod IP as a resource attribute, [as shown in the example][3]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: POD_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.podIP
           # The k8s.pod.ip is used to associate pods for k8sattributes
           - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
             value: "k8s.pod.ip=$(POD_IP)"
   # ...
   ```

   This ensures that [Kubernetes Attributes Processor][4] which is used in [the config map][5] is able to extract the necessary metadata to attach to traces. There are additional [roles][6] that need to be set to allow access to this metadata. [The example][1] is complete, ready to use, and has the correct roles set up.
  
3. Provide your [application container][7]. To configure your application container, ensure that the correct OTLP endpoint hostname is used. The OpenTelemetry Collector runs as a DaemonSet, so the current host needs to be targeted. Set your application container's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable correctly, as in the [example chart][8]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: HOST_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.hostIP
             # The application SDK must use this environment variable in order to successfully
             # connect to the DaemonSet's collector.
           - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
             value: "http://$(HOST_IP):4318"
   # ...
   ```

{{% tab "Kubernetes (Gateway)" %}}

To deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and Datadog Exporter in a Kubernetes Gateway deployment

1. Use this [full example of configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector using the Datadog Exporter as a DaemonSet][1], including the application configuration example.

   [Some configuration options in the example][2] (repeated below) ensure that essential ports of the DaemonSet are exposed and accessible to your application:

   ```yaml
   # ...
        ports:
        - containerPort: 4318 # default port for OpenTelemetry HTTP receiver.
          hostPort: 4318
        - containerPort: 4317 # default port for OpenTelemetry gRPC receiver.
          hostPort: 4317
        - containerPort: 8888  # Default endpoint for querying Collector observability metrics.
   # ...
   ```

   If you do not need both the standard HTTP and gRPC ports for your application, you can remove the corresponding configuration options.

2. To collect valuable Kubernetes attributes, which are used for Datadog container tagging, report the Pod IP as a resource attribute, [as shown in the example][3]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: POD_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.podIP
           # The k8s.pod.ip is used to associate pods for k8sattributes
           - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
             value: "k8s.pod.ip=$(POD_IP)"
   # ...
   ```

   This ensures that [Kubernetes Attributes Processor][4] which is used in [the config map][5] is able to extract the necessary metadata to attach to traces. There are additional [roles][6] that need to be set to allow access to this metadata. [The example][1] is complete, ready to use, and has the correct roles set up.
  
3. Provide your [application container][7]. To configure your application container, ensure that the correct OTLP endpoint hostname is used. The OpenTelemetry Collector runs as a DaemonSet, so the current host needs to be targeted. Set your application container's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable correctly, as in the [example chart][8]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
           env:
           - name: HOST_IP
             valueFrom:
               fieldRef:
                 fieldPath: status.hostIP
             # The application SDK must use this environment variable in order to successfully
             # connect to the DaemonSet's collector.
           - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
             value: "http://$(HOST_IP):4318"
   # ...
   ```

4. Change the DaemonSet to include an [OTLP exporter][9] instead of the Datadog Exporter [currently in place][10]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
   exporters:
     otlp:
       endpoint: "<GATEWAY_HOSTNAME>:4317"
   # ...
   ```

5. Make sure that the service pipelines use this exporter, instead of the Datadog one that [is in place in the example][11]:

   ```yaml
   # ...
       service:
         pipelines:
           metrics:
             receivers: [hostmetrics, otlp]
             processors: [resourcedetection, k8sattributes, batch]
             exporters: [otlp]
           traces:
             receivers: [otlp]
             processors: [resourcedetection, k8sattributes, batch]
             exporters: [otlp]
   # ...
   ```

   This ensures that each Agent forwards its data through the OTLP protocol to the Collector Gateway. 

6. Replace `GATEWAY_HOSTNAME` with the address of your OpenTelemetry Collector Gateway.

7. To ensure that Kubernetes metadata continues to be applied to traces, tell the [`k8sattributes` processor][12] to forward the Pod IP to the Gateway Collector so that it can obtain the metadata:

   ```yaml
   # ...
   k8sattributes:
     passthrough: true
   # ...
   ```

   For more information about the `passthrough` option, read [its documentation][13].

8. Make sure that the Gateway Collector's configuration uses the same Datadog Exporter settings that have been replaced by the OTLP exporter in the Agents. For example (where `<DD_SITE>` is your site, {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}):

   ```yaml
   # ...
   exporters:
     datadog:
       api:
         site: <DD_SITE>
         key: ${env:DD_API_KEY}
   # ...
   ```

{{% tab "Kubernetes (Operator)" %}}

To use the OpenTelemetry Operator, follow the [official documentation for deploying the OpenTelemetry Operator][1]. As described there, deploy the certificate manager in addition to the Operator.

Configure the Operator using one of the OpenTelemetry Collector standard Kubernetes configurations:
* [DaemonSet deployment][2] - Use the DaemonSet deployment if you want to ensure you receive host metrics. 
* [Gateway deployment][3]

### Hostname resolution

See [Mapping OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions to Hostnames][25] to understand how the hostname is resolved.

## Deployment-based limitations

The OpenTelemetry Collector has [two primary deployment methods][20]: Agent and Gateway. Depending on your deployment method, the following components are available:

| Deployment mode | Host metrics | Kubernetes orchestration metrics | Traces | Logs auto-ingestion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| as Gateway | | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | |
| as Agent | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} | {{< X >}} |
