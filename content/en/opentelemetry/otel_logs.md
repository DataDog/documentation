<div class="alert alert-warning"><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/">OpenTelemetry logging</a> and Datadog Exporter's feature for sending logs to Datadog are in alpha.</div>

## Overview

[OpenTelemetry][1] is an open source observability framework that provides IT teams with standardized protocols and tools for collecting and routing telemetry data. Created as an incubator project by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][2] (CNCF), OpenTelemetry provides a consistent format for instrumenting, generating, gathering, and exporting application telemetry data—namely metrics, logs, and traces—to monitoring platforms for analysis and insight.

The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent process for collecting and exporting telemetry data emitted by many processes. Datadog has an [Exporter][3] available for the OpenTelemetry Collector which allows you to forward traces, metrics, and logs data from OpenTelemetry to Datadog. 

For collecting logs, Datadog recommends using the Collector's [filelog receiver][4]. The filelog receiver tails the log files that you specify. Then the Datadog Exporter (set up in the Collector) sends the log data to Datadog.

## Setup

If your applications and services are instrumented with [OpenTelemetry][4] libraries, send the logs data to the Datadog backend by using the OpenTelemetry Collector with the Datadog Exporter.

[Send logs to the OpenTelemetry collector, and use the Datadog exporter to forward them to Datadog][5]

Read [OpenTelemetry][6] for more information.
