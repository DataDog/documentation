If you experience unexpected behavior using OpenTelemetry with Datadog, this guide may help you resolve the issue. If you continue to have trouble, contact [Datadog Support][1] for further assistance.

## Different Kubernetes hostname and node name

When deploying in Kubernetes, if the hostname reported by Datadog does not match the expected node name, this is typically the result of missing `k8s.node.name` (and optionally `k8s.cluster.name`) tags.

To troubleshoot, make sure your application deployment and Collector are configured correctly.

Configure the `k8s.pod.ip` attribute for your application deployment: 

```yaml
env:
  - name: MY_POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        apiVersion: v1
        fieldPath: status.podIP
  - name: OTEL_RESOURCE
    value: k8s.pod.ip=$(MY_POD_IP)
```

Enable the `k8sattributes` processor in your Collector:

```yaml
k8sattributes:
[...]
processors:
  - k8sattributes
```

## Unexpected hostnames with AWS Fargate deployment

In AWS Fargate environments, an incorrect hostname might be reported for traces.

To troubleshoot, make sure to use the `resourcedetection` processor in your Collector configuration and enable the `ecs` detector.

```yaml
processors:
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [env, ecs]
    timeout: 2s
    override: false
```
