## Overview

Test Visibility's Auto Test Retries feature allows retrying failing tests up to N times to avoid failing your build due to flaky tests:
a failing test case is retried either until it passes successfully or until there are no more retry attempts left (in which case the build fails).

## Setup

Ensure [Test Visibility][1] is configured for your test runs.

### Compatibility

* dd-trace-java >= 1.34.0
* dd-trace-js >= v5.19.0 and dd-trace-js >= v4.43.0
* datadog-ci-rb >= 1.4.0

### Configuration

{{< tabs >}}

{{% tab "Java" %}}
After you have set up Test Visibility, you can configure Auto Test Retries from the [Test Service Settings page][1].

The default behavior of the feature is to retry any failing test case up to 5 times.
This behavior can be fine-tuned with the following environment variables:

* `DD_CIVISIBILITY_FLAKY_RETRY_ONLY_KNOWN_FLAKES` - if this environment variable is set to `true`, only the test cases that Test Visibility considers [flaky][2] are retried.
* `DD_CIVISIBILITY_FLAKY_RETRY_COUNT` - can be set to any non-negative number to change the maximum number of retries per test case.

#### Known limitations

[jest-image-snapshot][2] is incompatible with `jest.retryTimes` unless `customSnapshotIdentifier` is passed (see [jest-image-snapshot docs][3]) to `toMatchImageSnapshot`. Therefore, auto test retries do not work unless `customSnapshotIdentifier` is used.

This behavior can be fine-tuned with the following environment variables:

* `DD_CIVISIBILITY_RETRY_FAILED_TESTS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` - a non-negative number to change the maximum number of retries per test case (default: 5).
* `DD_CIVISIBILITY_RETRY_FAILED_TESTS_TOTAL_LIMIT` - a non-negative number to set the maximum total number of failed tests to retry (default: 100)

## Explore results in the Test Visibility Explorer

You can query the retried tests in the [Test Visibility Explorer][2]: they have the `@test.is_retry` tag set to `true` (some of them may also have the `@test.is_new` set to `true`, which indicates they have been retried by the [Early Flakiness Detection][3] feature).

## Troubleshooting

If you suspect there are any issues with Auto Test Retries, navigate to the [Test Service Settings page][4], look for your test service, and click **Configure**. Disable Auto Test Retries by clicking on the toggle.
