## Overview

Test Visibility's Flaky Test Retries feature allows retrying flaky tests up to N times to avoid failing your build:
a failing flaky test case is retried either until it passes successfully or until there are no more retry attempts left (in which case the build fails).

## Setup

Ensure [Test Visibility][1] is configured for your test runs.

### Compatibility

* dd-trace-java >= 1.34.0

### Configuration

After you have set up Test Visibility, you can configure Flaky Test Retries from the [Test Service Settings page][2].

The default behavior of the feature is to retry any failing test case up to 5 times.
This behavior can be fine-tuned with the following environment variables:

* `DD_CIVISIBILITY_FLAKY_RETRY_ONLY_KNOWN_FLAKES` - if this environment variable is set to `true`, only the test cases that Test Visibility considers [flaky][3] are retried.
* `DD_CIVISIBILITY_FLAKY_RETRY_COUNT` - can be set to any non-negative number to change the maximum number of retries per test case.

## Explore results in the Test Visibility Explorer

You can query the retried tests in the [Test Visibility Explorer][4]: they have the `@test.is_retry` tag set to `true` (some of them may also have the `@test.is_new` set to `true`, which indicates they have been retried by the [Early Flakiness Detection][5] feature).

## Troubleshooting

If you suspect there are any issues with Flaky Test Retries, navigate to the [Test Service Settings page][2], look for your test service, and click **Configure**. Disable Flaky Test Retries by clicking on the toggle.
