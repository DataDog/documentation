## Overview

Ensure that [Test Visibility][3] is already set up for Swift.

### Compatibility

The CI Visibility - RUM integration is available for these versions of `dd-sdk-swift-testing` and `dd-sdk-ios`:

* `dd-sdk-swift-testing` >= 2.0.0
* `dd-sdk-ios` >= 1.10.0

## Connect Swift tests and RUM

If you link `dd-sdk-swift-testing` for your UI tests and the application being tested is instrumented using [Real User Monitoring][1], your test results and their generated RUM browser sessions and session replays are automatically linked. 

A **RUM Sessions** tab appears in the Test Visibility test detail side panel.

The RUM session has all the data that [RUM normally collects][2] so you can debug potential issues in your iOS tests, such as user name or unexpected errors.
