## Overview

If you run your tests inside a container that you launch yourself within the build (for example, using [`docker run`][1] or [`docker-compose`][2]), forward the following environment variables to the container depending on your CI provider. This enables the Datadog tracer to autodetect the build information.

Additionally, you need to pass in the environment variables required to configure the tracer as described in the [per-language test instrumentation instructions][3] (such as `DD_SERVICE`, `DD_ENV`, and a valid `DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL` that is accessible from within the container).

## Manage environment variables

This table provides a non-exhaustive list of environment variables available for configuring the tracer:
