## Overview

You can use your Test Optimization search query and visualization graphs in dashboards, monitors, and notebooks, or programmatically search for events using the [Search Tests Events endpoint][1]. 

## Export the search query or visualization

You can copy, export, or download your aggregated search query and visualization graphs in the [Test Optimization Explorer][2].

Click the **Export** button on the right hand corner and select an option from the dropdown menu:

- Share your [saved view][6] of the [Test Optimization Explorer][3].
- Export your search results to a [CI Test monitor][4] that triggers alerts on predefined thresholds.
- Export your search results to an [existing notebook][5] for reporting or consolidation purposes.
- Download your search results as a CSV file for individual CI Visibility test events and specific aggregations.

Options available for some visualization types are not supported in others. For example, you cannot download a distribution graph into a CSV file.
