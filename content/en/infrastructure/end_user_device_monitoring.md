End User Device Monitoring helps IT teams monitor the health and performance of employee desktops and laptops, physical or virtual, to detect and resolve issues that affect productivity. This gives organizations a unified view of device, network, and application performance across their workforce.

## How it works

End User Device Monitoring uses the Datadog Agent to collect data directly from employee desktops and laptops. The Agent gathers system metrics, network information, and logs from each device and sends them to Datadog for analysis.

Devices appear in the Infrastructure Host List, where you can view performance data such as CPU, memory, and network usage. You can use Fleet Automation to manage the Agents installed on those devices, including checking version status, verifying configuration consistency, and ensuring that the necessary integrations are enabled.
