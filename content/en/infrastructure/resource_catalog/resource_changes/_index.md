## Overview

Resource Changes provides visibility and control over configuration changes to your cloud infrastructure. It helps application developers and shared infrastructure teams monitor modifications to resources, aiding in troubleshooting incidents and understanding the evolution of your environment.

Resource Changes supports a variety of resources, including:
- Hosts
- Containers
- Serverless Functions
- Databases
- Queues
- Storage
- Networking
- Monitoring
- Identity
- Data Processing (for example, GCP Dataproc)

For a comprehensive list of supported resources, see the [Supported resources](#supported-resources) section.

## Setup

To view configuration changes for your resources:

1.  **Enable Resource Collection**: Ensure that resource collection is enabled for your cloud resources so they are visible within the Resource Catalog. You can manage this setting from the [Resource Catalog setup page][2] or the relevant [cloud provider integration tile][3].
2.  **Cloud Provider Event Forwarding**: For real-time or more frequent change updates, configure event forwarding from your cloud provider:
    - **AWS**: Set up change event forwarding through AWS Config. See the [AWS Config integration page][4] for details.
    - **Azure**: Enable Resource Collection for your Azure subscriptions in the [Azure integration tile][5]. Azure Resource Graph captures configuration changes.
    - **Google Cloud Platform**: Follow the instructions on the [Google Cloud Platform integration page][6] to forward change events using a Pub/Sub topic and subscription using Google Cloud Asset Inventory.
    
 <div class="alert alert-info">If you only enable Resource Collection without specific cloud provider event forwarding, Datadog uses <strong>Snapshot Changes</strong>.</div>   

### Snapshot changes

Snapshot Changes are generated by comparing crawled snapshots of your resource configurations. These snapshots are taken approximately every 5-15 minutes.

Key characteristics of Snapshot Changes:
- **No Additional Setup**: Requires no extra configuration beyond enabling resource collection.
- **End State Reflection**: Snapshot Changes reflect the differences between snapshots. If a resource is updated and then deleted between crawls, only the deletion is reflected as the final state.
- **Retention**: Datadog Snapshot Changes are retained for 2 weeks.
- **Cost**: Generating Snapshot Changes does not incur additional event charges.

Cloud provider changes (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph, Google Cloud Asset Inventory) are available in Event Management with a default retention of 15 months. Forwarding these events does not incur charges for custom events from Datadog.

## Navigating and viewing resource changes

You can access Resource Changes in the Datadog platform in the following ways:

1.  **Main Navigation**: Go to **Infrastructure > Resources > Resource Changes**.
2.  **Within Resource Catalog**: Navigate to the [Resource Catalog][1] and click on the **Changes*- tab at the top of the page.
3.  **Within a Resource's Side Panel**:
    - Open the side panel for a specific resource (for example, by clicking on a host in the Resource Catalog or a related host view).
    - Scroll down to the **Recent Changes*- section.

## Querying resource changes

The Resource Changes view allows you to search and filter changes using various attributes.

| Query Parameter         | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change Type             | Filter by the type of change (Update, Create, Delete).                      | `latest_change_type:Update`                                                      |
| Resource Category       | Query across cloud providers for a general category of resource.            | `resource_category:hosts` (shows EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute instances, etc.)   |
| Resource Type           | Query for specific resource types.                                          | `resource_type:aws_ec2_instance`                                                 |
| First-Class Attributes  | Filter by attributes like Cloud Provider, Region, Environment, Account, etc. | `cloud_provider:aws region:us-east-1 env:staging account_id:123456789012`     |
| Resource Name           | Search for resources by their display name.                                 | `display_name:*bucket*`                                                          |
| Tags                    | Filter resources based on assigned tags.                                    | `tags:"application:frontend" "owner:team-alpha"`                                   |

### Supported search query types

- **Wildcard**: Use asterisks `*` for partial matching (before and after the term). Example: `service:*example*`
- **Union (OR)**: Use `OR` for multiple values (not available for resource types or categories). Example: `service:(service_a OR service_b)`
- **Exclusion (Empty/Not Empty)**: Use `-` prefix to exclude. Example: `-service:*` (shows resources where the service tag is not set).

## Troubleshooting with resource changes

Resource Changes are invaluable during incident troubleshooting to answer the critical question: "What changed?".

When a monitor alerts, you might find an "Infrastructure Changes" link or section within the Monitor status page or related views. This directs you to the Resource Changes page, pre-filtered with context from the alert (like relevant tags, time frame, and service). This allows you to:

- **Quickly identify relevant changes**: See a consolidated view of the latest changes for resources that could be impacting the alerting service.
- **Broaden your search**: Investigate changes beyond your immediate purview that might affect your service's reliability, especially for untagged or shared infrastructure.
- **Drill down into change details**: Select a change to view specifics, such as the exact configuration modification (often as a side-by-side diff), and sometimes, related logs from cloud providers (like AWS CloudTrail) to understand who made the change and why.

By correlating infrastructure changes with incident timelines, you can significantly reduce the Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).
