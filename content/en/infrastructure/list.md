## Overview

The Infrastructure list shows all of your hosts monitored by Datadog with activity during the last two hours (default) and up to one week. Search your hosts or group them by tags. In Datadog, navigate to [**Infrastructure > Hosts**][10] to view the Infrastructure list. This list should not be used to estimate your infrastructure host billing. See the [billing][11] page to learn about billing.

## Hosts

The following information is displayed in the infrastructure list for your hosts:

Hostname
: The preferred hostname [alias](#aliases) (use the Options menu to view Cloud Name or Instance ID).

Cloud Name
: A hostname [alias](#aliases).

Instance ID
: A hostname [alias](#aliases).

Status
: Displays `ACTIVE` when the expected metrics are received and displays `INACTIVE` if no metrics are received.

CPU
: The percent of CPU used (everything but idle).

IOWait
: The percent of CPU spent waiting on the IO (not reported for all platforms).

Load 15
: The system load over the last 15 minutes.

Apps
: The Datadog integrations reporting metrics for the host.

Operating System
: The tracked operating system.

Cloud Platform
: Cloud platform the host is running on (for example, AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).

Datadog Agent
: Agent version that is collecting data on the host.

OpenTelemetry
: OpenTelemetry Collector version that is collecting data on the host.

### Hostname

The Datadog Agent collects potential hostnames from several different sources. For more details, see [How does Datadog determine the Agent hostname?][1].

**Note**: Hostnames should be unique within a Datadog account, otherwise you may experience some inconsistencies on your host graphs.

### Inspect

Click on any host to view more details including:
- [aliases](#aliases)
- [tags][2]
- [metrics][3]
- [containers][4]
- [logs][5] (if enabled)
- [Agent configuration](#agent-configuration) (if enabled)
- [OpenTelemetry Collector configuration](#opentelemetry-collector-configuration) (if enabled)

#### Aliases

Datadog creates aliases for host names when there are multiple uniquely identifiable names for a single host. The names collected by the Agent are added as aliases for the chosen canonical name. For example, a single host running in EC2 might have an instance ID (`i-abcd1234`), a generic hostname provided by EC2 based on the host's IP address (`ip-192-0-0-1`), and a meaningful host name provided by an internal DNS server or a config-managed hosts file (`myhost.mydomain`).

#### Agent configuration

With the [General Availability (GA) release of Fleet Automation][12], the Agent Configuration section has moved to [Fleet Automation][13] and is no longer displayed in the infrastructure list host detail panel. You can now view and manage Agent configurations across your entire infrastructure with enhanced visibility and control through Fleet Automation.

To access Agent configurations, use the **Open Host** dropdown button in the top-right corner of the host detail panel and select "View Agent Configurations" to go directly to the Fleet Automation UI. This provides advanced configuration management capabilities and fleet-wide visibility.

#### OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

When the [Datadog Extension][14] is configured with your OpenTelemetry Collector, you can view collector configuration and build information directly in the infrastructure list host detail panel. The Datadog Extension provides visibility into your collector fleet from within the Datadog UI, making it easier to manage and debug your OpenTelemetry Collector deployments.

<div class="alert alert-info">The <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/datadogextension">Datadog Extension</a> must be enabled and configured in your OpenTelemetry Collector. This component is only available in OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib version 0.129.0 or greater.</div>

To view OpenTelemetry Collector configurations:
1. Click on any host running the OpenTelemetry Collector in the infrastructure list
2. In the host detail panel, select the **OTel Collector** tab
3. View the build information and complete collector configuration

The displayed configuration is scrubbed of sensitive information and shows only the settings you've configured. This includes collector version, build details, component information, and the full configuration structure.

### Export

For a JSON formatted list of your hosts reporting to Datadog, use one of the following:

* The **JSON API permalink** at the top of the infrastructure list.
* The [search hosts API endpoint][7] - see the [developer guide][8] for an example.

#### Agent version

At times it may also be prove useful to audit your Agent versions to ensure you are running the latest version. To accomplish this, use the [get_host_agent_list script][9], which leverages the JSON permalink to output the current running Agents with version numbers. There is also a `json_to_csv` script to convert the JSON output into a CSV file.

#### No Agent

Another use case of the JSON export would be to get a list of Amazon EC2 (excluding RDS) instances with no Agent installed. These instances appear in the infrastructure list by setting up your AWS account in the Datadog AWS integration tile. See the Python3 script below:

```python
# 3p
import requests

# stdlib
import json
import pprint
import os

api_key = os.environ['DD_API_KEY']
app_key = os.environ['DD_APP_KEY']

url = "https://app.datadoghq.com/reports/v2/overview?\
window=3h&with_apps=true&with_sources=true&with_aliases=true\
&with_meta=true&with_tags=true&api_key=%s&application_key=%s"

infra = json.loads(requests.get(url %(api_key,app_key)).text)

for host in infra['rows']:
    if (('aws' in host['apps']) and ('rds' not in host['apps']) and ('agent' not in host['apps'])):
        try:
            print(f'HOST: {host["name"]} - TAGS: {host["tags_by_source"]}')
        except:
            pass
```
