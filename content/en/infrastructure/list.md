## Overview

The Infrastructure list shows all of your hosts monitored by Datadog with activity during the last 2 hours(default) and up to 1 week. Search your hosts, or group them by tags.

## Hosts

The following information is displayed in the infrastructure list for your hosts:

Hostname
: The preferred hostname [alias](#aliases) (use the Options menu to view Cloud Name or Instance ID).

Cloud Name
: A hostname [alias](#aliases).

Instance ID
: A hostname [alias](#aliases).

Status
: Displays `UP` when the expected metrics are received and displays `???` if no metrics are received.

CPU
: The percent of CPU used (everything but idle).

IOWait
: The percent of CPU spent waiting on the IO (not reported for all platforms).

Load 15
: The system load over the last 15 minutes.

Apps
: The Datadog integrations reporting metrics for the host.

Operating System 
: The tracked operating system.

Cloud Platform
: Cloud platform the host is running on (for example, AWS, GCP, or Azure).

Datadog Agent
: Agent version that is collecting data on the host.

### Hostname

The Datadog Agent collects potential hostnames from a number of different sources. For more details, see [How does Datadog determine the Agent hostname?][1].

**Note**: Hostnames should be unique within a Datadog account, otherwise you may experience some inconsistencies on your host graphs.

### Inspect

Click on any host to view more details including [aliases](#aliases), [tags][2], [metrics][3], [containers][4] and [logs][5] (if enabled):

#### Aliases

Datadog creates aliases for host names when there are multiple uniquely identifiable names for a single host. The names collected by the Agent are added as aliases for the chosen canonical name. For example, a single host running in EC2 might have an instance ID (`i-abcd1234`), a generic hostname provided by EC2 based on the host's IP address (`ip-192-0-0-1`), and a meaningful host name provided by an internal DNS server or a config-managed hosts file (`myhost.mydomain`).

### Export

For a JSON formatted list of your hosts reporting to Datadog, use one of the following:

* The **JSON API permalink** at the bottom of the infrastructure list.
* The [search hosts API endpoint][6] - see the [developer guide][7] for an example.

#### Agent version

At times it may also be prove useful to audit your Agent versions to ensure you are running the latest version. To accomplish this, use the [get_host_agent_list script][8], which leverages the JSON permalink to output the current running Agents with version numbers. There is also a `json_to_csv` script to convert the JSON output into a CSV file.

#### No Agent

Another use case of the JSON export would be to get a list of AWS EC2 instances with no Agent installed. These instances appear in the infrastructure list by setting up your AWS account in the Datadog AWS integration tile. See this [example script][9].
