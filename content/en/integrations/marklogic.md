## Overview

Gather your logs from Marklogic and send them to Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

The Marklogic integration is included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package, so you don't need to install anything else on your host.

### Configuration

#### Log Collection

_Available for Agent versions >6.0_

1. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in `datadog.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    logs_enabled: true
    ```

2. Add this configuration block to your `marklogic.d/conf.yaml` file to start collecting your MarkLogic Logs:

    ```yaml
    logs:
        - type: file
          path: '<MARKLOGIC_LOG_FILE_PATH>'
          source: marklogic
          sourcecategory: database
          service: '<SERVICE>'
    ```

     Change the `path` and `service` parameter values and configure them for your environment.

3. [Restart the Agent][2].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][3] and look for `marklogic` under the Checks section.
