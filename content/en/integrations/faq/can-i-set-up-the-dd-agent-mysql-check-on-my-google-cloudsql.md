title: Can I set up the dd-agent mysql check on my Google CloudSQL?
kind: faq
---

Much like the "Native" [AWS RDS Integration][1] with MySQL, you can set up a Datadog Agent's MySQL integration to monitor on a MySQL instance running in Google CloudSQL. With this setup, you can complement the metrics you would otherwise get from Datadog's [Google CloudSQL Integration][2] with the metrics available from the Datadog Agent's [MySQL integration][3].

To set up this "extra" integration on your Google CloudSQL instance, you can set up the MySQL integration on a Datadog Agent and [configure it to remotely connect][4] to your Google CloudSQL instance instead of using the localhost default. The setup steps are otherwise the same as any other locally hosted MySQL instance.

With one caveat: Google CloudSQL [does not support performance_schemas][5], so you can't `GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.*` to the Datadog Agent user. As a result, two of the MySQL check's extra/optional metrics are not available for Google CloudSQL instances. Otherwise, the integration should work just as it would with any locally hosted MySQL instance.
