Datadog supports regexes to match JMX Mbean names and domain names to configure your `include` and `exclude` filters. The regexes must conform to [Javaâ€™s regular expression format][1]. Note that these filters were added in version 5.5.0.

Capture groups from the provided regex can be used to supply additional tag values for your metrics.

This article provides one example of how to use the `bean_regex` from the [Java integration][2], and how to reference such capture groups to set additional tags.

Suppose you have the following Mbean name: `domain.example.com:name=my.metric.name.env.dev.region.eu-central-1.method.GET.status.200`. There is some information we could use as tags once the Agent has collected the metric. For instance, we could export such metric with the following tags:

* `env`: `dev`
* `region`: `eu-central-1`
* `method`: `GET`
* `status`: `200`

Bean regexes can be supplied as a single regex or a list of regex expressions. For the latter, only the first entry of the list that matches will be taken into account. See an example of a configuration file to export your custom metrics with some additional tags:

```yaml
init_config:
  is_jmx: true

instances:
  - host: "<JMX_ENDPOINT>"
    port: "<JMX_PORT>"

    conf:
      - include:
          domain: domain.example.com
          bean_regex:
            - "domain.example.com:name=my.metric.name.*(?:\\.env\\.)([a-z]+)(?:.*\\.region\\.)([a-z-]+[0-9])(?:.*\\.method\\.)([A-Z]+)(?:.*\\.status\\.)([0-9]+)(?:.*)"
          attribute:
            attribute1:
              metric_type: gauge
              alias: "my.jmx.metric"
          tags:
              env: $1
              region: $2
              method: $3
              status_code: $4
              optional: tag
```

Each capture group is stored in a Java Map. The first capture group starts at position `0`. Once you determined which capture group you want to export as a tag, you just have to reference them in the `tags` section of your `include` or `exclude` filter, plus to the number of the group (e.g. the position inside the Map).

For the provided example in `bean_regex`, the capture groups are:

* `$0`: `domain.example.com:name=my.metric.name.env.dev.region.eu-central-1.method.GET.status.200`
* `$1`: `dev`
* `$2`: `eu-central-1`
* `$3`: `GET`
* `$4`: `200`

Using the [Metrics Explorer][3], you will be able to query your metrics and filter them by the tags you have just created.
