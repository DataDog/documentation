To verify you have access to JMX, test using JConsole or equivalent if possible. If you're unable to connect using JConsole [this article][1] may help to get you sorted. Also, if the metrics listed in your YAML aren't 1:1 with those listed in JConsole you'll need to correct this.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
For all versions of <strong>Agent v6</strong>, the <code>jmxterm</code> JAR is not shipped with the agent. To download and use <code>jmxterm</code>, see the <a href="https://github.com/jiaqi/jmxterm">upstream project</a>.
</div>

If you're able to connect using JConsole, run the following:

```
java -jar /opt/datadog-agent/agent/checks/libs/jmxterm-1.0-DATADOG-uber.jar -l localhost:<PORT> -u <USER> -p <PASSWORD>
```

If you're able to connect using the command above, run: `beans` and send to the [Datadog support team][2] a copy of the results from above along with the following information:


{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Agent v6" %}}

* Content of `/var/log/datadog/agent.log`
* Output of the [info command][1]
* Output of: `ps aux | grep jmxfetch`
* A copy of the YAML integration (send the file)


[1]: /agent/faq/agent-status-and-information
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Agent v5" %}}

* [Agent logs][1]
* Output of the [info command][2]
* Output of: `ps aux | grep jmxfetch`
* Content of `/var/log/datadog/jmxfetch.log`
* Output of: `sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_everything`
* A copy of the YAML integration (send the file)

**Note**: if you're able to see some metrics (`jvm.heap_memory`, `jvm.non_heap_memory`, etc.) it is a sign that JMXFetch is properly running. If you're targeting another application and not seeing related metrics, the likely issue is a misconfiguration in your YAML.

## Agent troubleshooting

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Agent >= v6.2" %}}

These commands are available since v6.2.0:

| Command                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------------              | :---                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list matching`     | List attributes that match at least one of your instances configuration.                                                                                                |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list limited`      | List attributes that do match one of your instances configuration but that are not being collected because it would exceed the number of metrics that can be collected. |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list collected`    | List attributes that are actually collected by your current instances configuration.                                                                                    |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list not-matching` | List attributes that don't match any of your instances configuration.                                                                                                   |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list everything`   | List every attributes available that has a type supported by JMXFetch.                                                                                                  |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx collect`           | Start the collection of metrics based on your current configuration and display them in the console.                                                                    |

By default theses commands run on all the configured jmx checks. If you want to use them for specific checks, specify them using the `--checks` flag :

`sudo datadog-agent jmx list collected --checks tomcat`

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Agent v6.0 and v6.1" %}}

The Agent 6 ships JMXFetch and supports all of its features, except those listed below.

The Agent doesn't have a full featured interface to JMXFetch, so you may have to run some commands manually to debug the list of beans collected, JVMs, etc. A typical manual call will take the following form:

```shell
/usr/bin/java -Xmx200m -Xms50m -classpath /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/lib/tools.jar:/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch-0.18.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.datadog.jmxfetch.App --check <CHECK_LIST> --conf_directory /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d --log_level INFO --log_location /var/log/datadog/jmxfetch.log --reporter console <COMMAND>
```

where `<COMMAND>` is any of:

- `list_everything`
- `list_collected_attributes`
- `list_matching_attributes`
- `list_not_matching_attributes`
- `list_limited_attributes`
- `list_jvms`

and `<CHECK_LIST>` corresponds to a list of valid `yaml` configurations in
`/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/`. For instance:

- `cassandra.d/conf.yaml`
- `kafka.d/conf.yaml`
- `jmx.d/conf.yaml`

Example:

```
/usr/bin/java -Xmx200m -Xms50m -classpath /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/lib/tools.jar:/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch-0.18.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.datadog.jmxfetch.App --check cassandra.d/conf.yaml jmx.d/conf.yaml --conf_directory /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d --log_level INFO --log_location /var/log/datadog/jmxfetch.log --reporter console list_everything
```

Note: the location to the JRE tools.jar (`/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/lib/tools.jar` in the example) might reside elsewhere in your system. You should be able to easily find it with `sudo find / -type f -name 'tools.jar'`.

**Note**: you may wish to specify alternative JVM heap parameters `-Xmx`, `-Xms`, the values used in the example correspond to the JMXFetch defaults.

## SSL troubleshooting

### JMX & SSL=true

Once JMX is enabled and your Agent check is successfully sending metrics to Datadog, you can secure the remote connection over an SSL Socket.

**Note**: You cannot secure JMX over SSL without using the JMX remote user/password authentication files. If you are using system level permissions to run your application, add these files and run them at startup.

This example shows the Datadog configuration for the Tomcat integration.

* Establish a certificate and key to apply to your [Java app keystore][3].
* Update your Datadog Tomcat `conf.yaml` file located in `conf.d/tomcat.d`:

```yaml
instances:
  - host: localhost
    port: 9000
    user: tomcat
    password: tomcat
    name: tomcat_webapp
    trust_store_path: <KEYSTORE_PATH>
    trust_store_password: <KEY_PASSWORD>
```

* [Restart the Agent][4].
