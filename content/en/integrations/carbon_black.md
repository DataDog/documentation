## Overview

Use the Datadog-Carbon Black integration to forward your Carbon Black EDR events and alerts as Datadog logs.


## Setup

### Installation

Datadog uses Carbon Black's event forwarder and Datadog's Lambda forwarder to collect Carbon Black events and alerts from your S3 bucket.

Carbon Black provides a [Postman collection][10] for the API that you use to create the Carbon Black event forwarder.

#### Configuration

1. [Install the Datadog Forwarder][1].
2. [Create a bucket in your AWS Management Console][2] to forward events to. 
3. [Configure the S3 bucket to allow the Carbon Black forwarder to write data][3]. 
   - **Important**: The S3 bucket must have a prefix with the keyword `carbon-black` in which the CB events come in. This allows Datadog to recognize the source of the logs correctly.
5. [Create an access level in the Carbon Black Cloud console][4].
6. [Create an API key in the Carbon Black Cloud console][5].
7. [Configure the API in Postman][6] by updating the value of the following Postman environment variables with the key created above: `cb_url`, `cb_org_key`, `cb_custom_id`, and `cb_custom_key`.
8. [Create two Carbon Black event forwarders][7] with different names for Carbon Black alerts (`"type": "alert"`) and endpoint events (`"type": "endpoint.event"`).
9. [Setup the Datadog Forwarder to trigger on the S3 bucket][8].
