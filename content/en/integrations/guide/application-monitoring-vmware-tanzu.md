## Overview

Datadog Application Monitoring for VMWare Tanzu enables VMware Tanzu users to monitor the health and performance of their applications.
It consists of the following three components:

* DogStatsD
* Trace Agent
* Container Agent

You can use DogStatsD to get your custom application metrics into Datadog. DogStatsD is a metrics aggregation service that implements the StatsD protocol and adds a few Datadog-specific extensions. For more information, see the [DogStatsD][5] documentation. Additionally, Datadog provides a list of DogStatsD libraries you can use to find [libraries][9] compatible with your application.

The Trace Agent is a service that collects application traces from various sources and forwards them to Datadog APM. For more information, see the [tracing][7] documentation.

The Container Agent is a smaller, lightweight version of the [Datadog Agent][6] that can forward metrics and logs to Datadog. See the [logs][8] documentation for more information. When enabled, the default behavior is for all logs from `stdout` and `stderr` to be collected and forwarded by TCP to the Container Agent.
