## Overview

The [Service Graph Connector for Observability \- Datadog][1] allows Datadog to automatically populate server and database Configuration Items (**CIs**) in your ServiceNow CMDB for newly discovered resources. You can obtain this connector from the ServiceNow [store][2].

For initial setup, follow the **guided setup instructions** provided by the Service Graph Connector.

The connector supports the following CI types:

- **Server**
- **Amazon RDS**

### Notes for existing integrations

If you already have the integration configured for **ServiceNow ITOM/ITSM**:

- The Service Graph Connector does not use the `Target table` and `Custom table` values from the configuration tile. You can save the integration with the Target table default values.
- You can reuse your existing ITOM/ITSM user, but you must grant them the `cmdb_import_api_admin` role. This is outlined in the Service Graph Connector's guided setup instructions.

## Customizing CI fields

In the [Datadog ServiceNow][3] integration tile, click the **Configure** tab, then the **Service Graph Connector** tab. Expand the **Customize CI** fields section. The following options are available:

CI Type
: The type of CI this field applies to.

ServiceNow Field
: The field in ServiceNow to apply it to.

Datadog Tag
: The tag to send from Datadog resources. (If multiple tags are found with the same name, they'll be comma-separated.)

For example, to add a CI field with a CI Type of `Host` and a ServiceNow Field of `Host Name`, add any *host* tag attribute to the `Datadog Tag` field.

**Note**: The `Datadog Tag` field must be a *host* tag that exists on Datadog hosts, not an attribute tag on a host.
