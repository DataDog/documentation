## Overview

The [Datadog Consul Integration][1] can collect information about your HCP Consul environment through a Consul client. HCP Consul is a version of Consul in which the control plane is managed by [HashiCorp Cloud Platform][10].

## Setup

To start collecting your Consul metrics:

1. Ensure you have set up HCP Consul according to the [Get Started with HCP Consul documentation][2].
2. Install the Datadog Agent on your [Consul client][3].
3. Edit the [`consul.d/conf.yaml` file][4], in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][5] and set the `url` configuration option to your Consul client URL.
5. Restart the [Agent][6].

## Metrics collected

Using the Datadog Consul Integration with HCP Consul collects a subset of the Consul Integration's [default metrics][7] that do not pertain to [server health][8], including the following:

- Information about Consul nodes
- Network coordinates (inter- and intra-data center latencies)
- [Cluster health][9] metrics
