## Overview

Datadog's Source Code Integration allows you to connect your Git repositories to Datadog to enable various source code-related features across the Datadog platform. It allows debugging stack traces, slow profiles, and other issues by accessing the relevant lines of your source code.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/source_code_integration/inline-code-snippet.png" alt="Inline code snippet of a Java RuntimeException with a button to view the code in GitHub" style="width:100%;">}}

## Connect your Git repositories to Datadog

To use most source code-related features, you must connect your Git repositories to Datadog. By default, when synchronizing your repositories, Datadog doesn't store the actual content of files in your repository, only the Git commit and tree objects.

### Source code management providers

Datadog supports the following features for the following source code management (SCM) providers. See [Usage](#usage) for more details about each feature:

| Feature | GitHub | GitLab | Azure DevOps | Bitbucket |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Connect SaaS Instance** | Yes <br />(GitHub.com) | Yes <br />(GitLab.com) | Yes <br />(Azure DevOps Services) | No <br />(Bitbucket.org) |
| **Connect On-Prem Instance** | Yes <br />(GitHub Enterprise Server) | Yes <br />(GitLab Self-Managed or Dedicated) | No <br />(Azure DevOps Server) | No <br />(Bitbucket Data Center or Server)|
| **Context Links** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Code Snippets** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | 
| **PR Comments** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

{{% tab "Other SCM Providers" %}}

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Repositories on self-hosted instances or private URLs are not supported out-of-the-box. To enable this feature, <a href="/help">contact Support</a>.
</div>

If you are using any other SCM provider, you can still manually link telemetry with your source code. To do so, upload your repository metadata with the [`datadog-ci git-metadata upload`][1] command. `datadog-ci v2.10.0` or later is required.

When you run `datadog-ci git-metadata upload` within a Git repository, Datadog receives the repository URL, the commit SHA of the current branch, and a list of tracked file paths.

Run this command for every commit that you need to be synchronized with Datadog.

### Validation

To ensure the data is being collected, run `datadog-ci git-metadata upload` in your CI pipeline.

You can expect to see the following output:

```
Reporting commit 007f7f466e035b052415134600ea899693e7bb34 from repository git@my-git-server.com:my-org/my-repository.git.

## Tag your APM Telemetry with Git information

Datadog Agent v7.35.0 or later is required.

If you have [APM][6] set up already, navigate to [**Integrations** > **Link Source Code**][7] and configure the source code integration for your backend services.

Your telemetry must be tagged with Git information that ties the running application version with a particular repository and commit.

For supported languages, Datadog recommends [embedding Git information](#embed-git-information-in-your-build-artifacts) in the deployed artifacts, which is then extracted by the [Datadog Tracing Libraries][9] automatically.

For other languages and configurations, you can [configure telemetry tagging](#configure-telemetry-tagging) yourself.

### Embed Git information in your build artifacts

You can embed the repository URL and commit hash in your build artifact. The [Datadog Tracing Libraries][9] use this information to automatically add the right tags to your APM service telemetry.

Select one of the following languages that supports embedding git information:

### Build inside a Docker container

If your build process is executed in CI within a Docker container, perform the following steps to ensure that the build can access Git information:

1. Add the following text to your `.dockerignore` file. This ensures that the build process is able to access a subset of the `.git` folder, enabling it to determine the git commit hash and repository URL.

   ```
   !.git/HEAD
   !.git/config
   !.git/refs
   ```

2. Add the following line of code to your `Dockerfile`. Ensure that it is placed before the actual build is ran.

   ```
   COPY .git ./.git
   ```

### Configure telemetry tagging

For unsupported languages, use the `git.commit.sha` and `git.repository_url` tags to link data to a specific commit. Ensure that the `git.repository_url` tag does not contain protocols. For example, if your repository URL is `https://github.com/example/repo`, the value for the `git.repository_url` tag should be `github.com/example/repo`.
