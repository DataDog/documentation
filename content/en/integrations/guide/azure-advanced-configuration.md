## Overview

This guide provides advanced configuration options and reference architectures for users configuring Datadog's Azure integration, as well as alternative configuration options for specific use cases.

### Reference architectures

The diagrams in this guide provide a visual representation of the configuration process and outcome when following the steps in the [Azure integration page][1]. This guide provides a detailed overview of Datadog's interaction with your Azure environment and answers common security, compliance, and governance questions.

### Alternate configurations

The setup processes documented in the [Azure integration page][1] are the recommended steps and result in the ideal configuration for the majority of users. Alternate configuration options in this document may be preferable for certain use cases. Any trade-offs in performance, features, or ease-of-management are outlined as needed.

## Metric and data collection

Enabling Datadog's Azure integration allows Datadog to:

  - Discover and monitor all resources in all subscriptions within the given scope
  - Automatically update discovered metric definitions, to ensure that all of the metrics available from Azure Monitor are collected
  - Ingest a range of both general and resource-specific metadata (including custom Azure tags), and apply it to the associated resource metrics in Datadog as tags
  - Query Azure metadata APIs and use the responses to [generate useful metrics in Datadog][2] for insights that Azure Monitor does not support

The Azure APIs used and data collected are identical regardless of whether you use the standard or Azure Native version of the integration.

### Metric and data collection

_Available in all Datadog Sites_

Follow these steps to enable the Azure integration:

  1. Create an app registration in your Active Directory and enter the credentials in the [Datadog Azure integration page][4].
  2. Give the application read access (`Monitoring Reader` role) to the subscriptions or management group you would like to monitor.

The diagram below outlines the process and resulting architecture of the Azure integration configuration described in the main documentation.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_architecture_and_configuration/app_registration_integration_setup.png" alt="Diagram of the app registration integration setup" >}}

Once this is completed, data collection begins automatically. The app registration information entered in Datadog allows Datadog to [request a token from Azure Active Directory][3] (AD). Datadog uses this token as the authorization for API calls to various Azure APIs, to discover resources within the scope provided, and collect data. This continuous process runs with two-minute intervals by default, and is used to discover and collect data from your Azure environment. The data collection process is pictured below.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_architecture_and_configuration/app_registration_metric_collection.png" alt="Diagram of the App Registration integration setup" >}}

## Log collection

The diagram below provides a reference architecture for forwarding logs from Azure to Datadog, as described in the [Event Hub log forwarding guide][5].

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_architecture_and_configuration/manual_log_forwarding.png" alt="Diagram of the manual log forwarding setup" >}}

### Alternate configuration options for log forwarding

The default architecture above is suitable for most users. Depending on the scale and composition of your Azure environment, as well as the methods your organization uses to implement this architecture, the sections below detail additional considerations that may be relevant.

#### Using the provided templates

The **Deploy to Azure** button in the main Azure [Event Hub Logging guide][13] provides a template for creating an Event Hub and forwarder function pair. In addition to using this template to deploy directly, you can use the underlying ARM templates as a starting point for your own infrastructure as code deployments.

These templates do not add diagnostic settings, apart from one optional diagnostic setting for activity logs. For resource logs, Datadog recommends utilizing ARM templates or Terraform to add diagnostic settings to your resources programmatically. These diagnostic settings must be added to every resource that needs to send resource logs to Datadog.

#### Region considerations

Diagnostic settings can only send resource logs to Event Hubs in the same region as the resource. Add an Event Hub and forwarder function pair in each region that contains resources for which you want to send resource logs to Datadog.

However, diagnostic settings are not limited to sending logs to Event Hubs in the same subscription as the resource. If you have multiple subscriptions within your Azure tenant, they can share a single Event Hub and forwarder function within the same region.

#### High-volume log considerations

As the volume of logs scales, you may see bottlenecks, typically arising in the Event Hubs. If you plan to submit high log volumes, you may want to consider adding additional partitions or using a Premium or Dedicated tier.
For especially high log volumes, you may consider adding additional Event Hub and forwarder function pairs within the same region, and splitting traffic between them.

## Install on Azure

Datadog provides an Azure extension to assist with Agent deployment on Azure instances:

* [Introducing Azure monitoring with one-click Datadog deployment][6]
* [Azure integration][10] _All sites_
* [Azure Native integration][7] _US3 only_

An alternative to the GUI installation is the command line.
To run the Datadog Agent in your Azure instances as an extension, use the command that matches your environment. Replace `<SITE_PARAMETER>` with your Datadog account **site parameter** value in the [Datadog sites page][8], and `<DATADOG_API_KEY>` with your [Datadog API key][9].

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Windows" %}}

{{< code-block lang="powershell" >}}
Set-AzVMExtension -Name "DatadogAgent" -Publisher "Datadog.Agent" -Type "DatadogWindowsAgent" -TypeHandlerVersion "7.0" -Settings @{"site" = "<SITE_PARAMETER>"; "agentVersion" = "latest"} -ProtectedSettings @{"api_key" = "<DATADOG_API_KEY>"} -DisableAutoUpgradeMinorVersion
{{< /code-block >}}

More information on the syntax to set Azure instance extensions can be found in the [Azure Extension Set-AzVMExtension documentation][1].

The Azure Extension can accept both normal settings and protected settings.

The normal settings include:

| Variable | Type | Description  |
|----------|------|--------------|
| `site` | String | Set the Datadog intake site, for example: `SITE=`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true">}} |
| `agentVersion` | String | The Agent version to install, following the format `x.y.z` or `latest` |
| `agentConfiguration` | URI | (optional) URI to the Azure blob containing the Agent configuration as a zip file. |
| `agentConfigurationChecksum` | String | The SHA256 checksum of the Agent configuration zip file, mandatory if `agentConfiguration` is specified. |

The protected settings include:

| Variable | Type | Description  |
|----------|------|--------------|
| `api_key`| String | Adds the Datadog API KEY to the configuration file. |

**Note**: If `agentConfiguration` and `api_key` are specified at the same time, the API key found in the `agentConfiguration` takes precedence. Also note that if an API key is set on the target machine, it's not possible to change it with `Set-AzVMExtension`.

### Specifying a configuration URI

This example shows how to specify a configuration for the Datadog Agent to use.
The Datadog Agent configuration URI must be an Azure blob storage URI.
The Datadog Windows Agent Azure Extension checks that the `agentConfiguration` URI comes from the `.blob.core.windows.net` domain.
The Datataog Agent configuration should be created from the `%PROGRAMDATA%\Datadog` folder.

{{< code-block lang="powershell" >}}
Set-AzVMExtension -Name "DatadogAgent" -Publisher "Datadog.Agent" -Type "DatadogWindowsAgent" -TypeHandlerVersion "7.0" -Settings @{"site" = "<SITE_PARAMETER>"; "agentConfiguration" = "https://<CONFIGURATION_BLOB>.blob.core.windows.net/<FILE_PATH>.zip"; "agentConfigurationChecksum" = "<SHA256_CHECKSUM>"} -DisableAutoUpgradeMinorVersion
{{< /code-block >}}

**Note**: After the Datadog Agent is installed, the configuration can only be changed when upgrading to a newer version.

### Set a specific version of the Agent

This example shows how to specify a version of the Agent to install. By default the Datadog Windows Agent Azure Extension installs the latest version of the Datadog Agent.

**Note**: Downgrades are *not* supported, so it's not possible to install a *lower* version of the Datadog Agent than the one currently installed on the target machine. To install a lower version of the Datadog Agent, uninstall the previous version first by removing the Datadog Windows Agent Azure Extension on the target machine. Removing the Datadog Windows Agent Azure Extension does not remove the Datadog Agent configuration.

{{< code-block lang="powershell" >}}
Set-AzVMExtension -Name "DatadogAgent" -Publisher "Datadog.Agent" -Type "DatadogWindowsAgent" -TypeHandlerVersion "7.0" -Settings @{"site" = "<SITE_PARAMETER>"; "agentVersion" = "latest"} -ProtectedSettings @{"api_key" = "<DATADOG_API_KEY>"} -DisableAutoUpgradeMinorVersion

{{< /code-block >}}

More information on the syntax to set Azure instance extensions can be found in the [Azure Extension CLI reference][1000].

The Azure Extension can accept both normal settings and protected settings.

The normal settings include:

| Variable | Type | Description  |
|----------|------|--------------|
| `site` | String | Set the Datadog intake site, for example: `SITE=`{{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true">}} |
| `agentVersion` | String | The Agent version to install, following the format `x.y.z` or `latest` |
| `agentConfiguration` | URI | (optional) URI to the Azure blob containing the Agent configuration as a zip file. |
| `agentConfigurationChecksum` | String | The SHA256 checksum of the Agent configuration zip file, mandatory if `agentConfiguration` is specified. |

The protected settings include:

| Variable | Type | Description  |

**Note**: If `agentConfiguration` and `api_key` are specified at the same time, the API key found in the `agentConfiguration` takes precedence. If an API key is set on the target machine, it's not possible to change it with the `api_key` setting.

### Specifying a configuration URI

This example shows how to specify a configuration for the Datadog Agent to use.
- The Datadog Agent configuration URI must be an Azure blob storage URI.
- The Datadog Linux Agent Azure Extension checks that the `agentConfiguration` URI comes from the `.blob.core.windows.net` domain.
- The Datataog Agent configuration should be created from the `/etc/datadog-agent/` folder.

{{< code-block lang="bash" >}}
az vm extension set --publisher "Datadog.Agent" --name "DatadogLinuxAgent" --version 7.0 --settings '{"site":"datadoghq.com", "agentVersion":"latest", "agentConfiguration":"https://<CONFIGURATION_BLOB>.blob.core.windows.net/<FILE_PATH>.zip", "agentConfigurationChecksum":"<SHA256_CHECKSUM>"}' --protected-settings '{"api_key":"<DATADOG_API_KEY>"}' --no-auto-upgrade-minor-version

{{% collapse-content title="Azure count metrics" level="h4" expanded=false id="azure-count-metrics" %}}
Datadog generates an additional metric for each resource monitored with the [Azure integration][1]: `azure.*.count`. For example, Azure Virtual Machines monitored by Datadog reports `azure.vm.count`.

The `azure.*.count` metric is an improvement over `azure.*.status`, which is deprecated.

## Count metric

The `azure.*.count` metric provides two fundamental pieces of information:

- The number of resources of that type.
- The status of each resource as reported by Azure.

The `azure.*.count` metric is created in the same namespace as the other metrics for that resource type, for example: `azure.network_loadbalancers.count`. It includes all of the same metadata tags as the other metrics in that namespace, plus as additional tag for `status`.

### Use cases

Use the `azure.*.count` metric to:

- Create a view of the number of Virtual Machines broken out by their status over time by graphing `azure.vm.count` over everything and summing by `status`.
- Create query widgets in dashboards to display the number of a given resource type. Use any available tags to scope the count to a relevant aggregation such as region, resource group, kind, or status.
- Create monitors to alert you about the status of different Azure resources.

**Note**: In some cases, the default visualization settings can make it appear as though resources are being double counted intermittently in charts or query widgets. This does not affect monitors or widgets scoped to a specific status.
You can reduce this effect by turning off [interpolation][2] in charts or query widgets by setting Interpolation > none or using `.fill(null)`.

For most resource types, the possible statuses are:

- Running
- Unavailable
- Unknown
- Degraded
- Failed

Virtual machines have more detailed statuses, including:

- Running
- Stopped_deallocated
- Stopped
- Unknown
- Unavailable
- Degraded
- Failed

If you see a status of `query_failed` you need to enable the Resource Health provider in Azure.

## Find your tenant name

1. Navigate to [portal.azure.com][1].
2. In the left sidebar, select **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Under **Basic information**, find the **Name** value.

## Unable to login

If you experience an error logging in while trying to install the Azure integration, contact [Datadog support][3]. When possible, attach a screenshot.

## Missing metrics

Ensure you completed the installation process, which includes giving read permissions to the Azure application for the subscriptions you want to monitor.

For ARM deployed virtual machines, you must also turn on Diagnostics and select the VM metrics you would like to collect. See **Enable Diagnostics** below for instructions.

For other missing metrics, contact [Datadog support][3] with the following information about the metric:
- dimensions
- resource group
- resource name
- subscription ID or subscription name 

Attach a screenshot of a graph from Azure Monitor that shows a graph of the metric. **Important**: Graph 1-minute data points in the screenshot.

### Enable diagnostics

Turning on Diagnostics allows ARM deployed VMs to collect logging information which includes metrics for CPU, Network, etc. Follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal][1] and locate your VM.
2. Click on **Diagnostics settings** under the **Monitoring** section.
3. Pick a storage account and click **Enable guest-level monitoring**.
4. By default, basic metrics and logs are enabled. Adjust based on your preferences.
5. Click **Save** to save any changes.

    {{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_troubleshooting/azure_enable_diagnostics.png" alt="azure diagnostics settings overview displayed with No storage account highlighted under Pick a storage account and enable guest level monitoring enabled" style="width:70%">}}

## Automated log collection

### Naming conflicts

If you have Azure resources with the same resource name as one of the default parameters, it can lead to naming conflicts. Azure does not allow resources to share resource names within an individual subscription. Datadog recommends renaming the default parameter with a unique name that does not already exist within your environment.

**Note:** If you are re-running the template due to this failure, it is also advised that you remove the entire resource group to create a fresh deployment. 

### Unregistered resource provider

If your template deployment is failing due to the error **The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.EventHub'**:

Azure has resource providers for each of its services, for example: `Microsoft.EventHub` for the Azure EventHub. If your Azure subscription is not registered to a required resource provider the script fails. You can fix this issue by registering with the resource provider. Run this command in CloudShell. 

{{< code-block lang="shell" filename="Example" >}}

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.EventHub

{{< /code-block >}}

### Exceeding log quota

Did you install the script successfully, but you are still not seeing activity/platform logs within the Logs Explorer? 

Ensure that you have not exceeded your [daily quota][4] for log retention.

**Note:** It is advised that you take at least five minutes after the execution of the script to start looking for logs in the Logs Explorer.

## Monitoring multiple app registrations

Subscriptions monitored by multiple app registrations can introduce overlapping access configurations. This setup is not recommended and may result in integration issues or system conflicts, and may also increase your Azure Monitor costs.

## Powered-down Azure VMs on the Infrastructure List

When you power down your VMs in Azure, the Datadog Azure integration still collects the metric `azure.vm.status` for that VM. This metric is tagged with `status:running`, `status:not_running`, or `status:unknown`.

This is intended, but causes the VM to remain on your infrastructure list. If your VM reports only this metric, it does not count towards your billable host-count. See the Datadog [Billing section][5] for more info on billing matters.

If you destroy your Azure VM, it phases out of your infrastructure list within 3 hours.

## Azure VMs appear in the App without metrics

After properly installing the Azure Integration within Datadog, metrics from you Azure VMs and other services should begin to flow in about 15 minutes.

If after this time you see Azure VMs in your infrastructure list but no metrics are being reported, a few things can be happening.

1. Make sure you are looking for the right metrics.
    **Classic** virtual machine metrics begin with the azure.vm namespace and ARM deployed virtual machine metrics begin with the `azure.compute_virtualmachines` namespace.

2. If neither of these namespaces are returning metrics, make sure **Diagnostics** is turned on for the Virtual Machines within the Azure Portal. NOTE, only Boot diagnostics and Basic metrics are required.
    * For **Classic** VMs:
    {{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_vms_appearing_in_the_app_without_metrics/classic_vm.png" alt="The azure portal showing the diagnostics view of a classic virtual machine with status set to on" >}}

    * For ARM deployed VMs:
    {{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_vms_appearing_in_the_app_without_metrics/arm_deployed_vm.png" alt="The azure portal showing the diagnostics settings view of a virtual machine with status set to on" >}}

3. Make sure the Virtual machine is running.
    The integration does not collect performance metrics for stopped or deallocated machines. Use the `azure.vm.count` metric and the `status` tag values of `running`, `stopped`, and `stopped_deallocated` to determine the status of your hosts. Make sure the host in question has `status:running`, and is running in the Azure portal.
    {{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_vms_appearing_in_the_app_without_metrics/azure_vm_running_2025-05-02.png" alt="A graph of the azure.vm.count metric from status:running" >}}

## Issues with `azure.*.count` metrics

If your Azure integration is reporting metrics but not `azure.*.count`, or `azure.*.count` is returning `status:query_failed`, your Azure subscription needs to register the Azure Resource Health provider.

Using the Azure Command Line Interface:
```bash
azure login # Login to the Azure user associated with your Datadog account
azure config mode arm
azure provider register Microsoft.ResourceHealth
```

The `azure.*.count` metric should show in Datadog within 5 - 10 minutes.
