  This guide is for managing the Azure Native integration with the Datadog resource.
</div>

This guide is for managing the integration between Azure and Datadog in the Azure portal using the Datadog resource. The Datadog resource in Azure represents the connection between your Datadog organization and your Azure environment. You can configure a Datadog resource to link as many subscriptions as you wish to monitor. [Create a Datadog resource][1] in Azure before proceeding with this guide.

With the Datadog resource, you can manage the following within the associated Azure subscription:
- View or modify the scope of the Datadog resource to include the subscriptions to monitor
- Configure the collection of Azure metrics and platform logs
- Verify the Azure resources sending metrics and logs
- View API keys and set the key default for your Datadog resource Agent deployments
- Deploy the Datadog VM Agent to your Azure VMs and view details about running Agents
- Deploy the Datadog .NET extension to your Azure Web Apps and view details about installed extensions
- Reconfigure single sign-on
- Change the billing plan for your Datadog organization (Azure Marketplace only)
- Enable or disable the Azure integration
- Delete the Datadog resource

This page describes the Azure Portal experience. If you prefer to use CLI, see the [Azure CLI for Datadog][2].

## Overview

Select **Overview** in the left sidebar to view information for your Datadog resource.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/resource-overview.png" alt="The Azure portal with Overview highlighted in the left nav bar" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

### Essentials

The overview page displays essential information about your Datadog resource including: resource group name, location (region), subscriptions, tags, Datadog organization link, status, pricing plan, and billing term.

**Note**: The Datadog organization link is a SAML link if SSO is enabled. If the Datadog organization was created with the Azure marketplace, set a password the first time you use this link.

### Links

The overview page provides links to view Datadog dashboards, logs, and host maps.

### Resource summary

The overview page provides a summary table of the resources sending logs and metrics to Datadog. This table includes the following columns:

| Column             | Description                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource type      | The Azure resource type                                                   |
| Total resources    | The count of all resources for the resource type                          |
| Logs to Datadog    | The count of resources sending logs to Datadog through the integration    |
| Metrics to Datadog | The count of resources sending metrics to Datadog through the integration |

### Disable

To stop sending logs and metrics from Azure to Datadog, select **Disable** on the overview page, then click **OK**.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/disable.png" alt="The Datadog resource page within the Azure portal with Overview selected on the left nav bar, the Disable tab highlighted, and the OK button highlighted" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

**Note**: Disabling the Datadog resource stops the submission of metrics and platform logs to Datadog for the associated subscriptions. Any resources in the subscriptions submitting data directly to Datadog through the Agent or extension are unaffected.

### Enable

To start sending logs and metrics from Azure to Datadog, select **Enable** on the overview page, then click **OK**. Any previous configuration for logs and metrics is retrieved and enabled.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/enable.png" alt="The Datadog resource page within the Azure portal, with Overview selected in the left nav bar,the Enable tab highlighted, and the OK button highlighted" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

### Delete

To delete the Datadog resource, select **Delete** on the overview page. Confirm deletion by typing `yes`, then click **Delete**.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/delete.png" alt="The Datadog resource page within the Azure portal, with Overview selected in the left nav bar, the Delete tab highlighted, and a field to confirm deletion" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

For Datadog organizations billed through the Azure Marketplace:
- If the deleted Datadog resource is the only Datadog resource mapped to its associated Datadog organization, logs and metrics are no longer sent to Datadog and all billing stops for Datadog through Azure. Datadog support will reach out to confirm next steps with your account.
- If there are additional Datadog resources mapped to the associated Datadog organization, deleting a Datadog resource only stops sending logs and metrics for its associated Azure subscription.

If your Datadog organization is **not** billed through the Azure Marketplace, deleting a Datadog resource just removes the integration for that Azure subscription.

### Change plan

Select **Change Plan** on the overview page to change your Datadog billing plan.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/change-plan1.png" alt="The Datadog resource page within the Azure portal, with Overview selected along the left nav bar and the Change Plan tab highlighted" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

The portal retrieves all the available Datadog plans for your tenant, including any private offers. Select the appropriate plan and click **Change Plan**.

## Datadog org configurations

### Monitored subscriptions

Select **Monitored Subscriptions** in the left sidebar to view or modify the scope of the Datadog resource. A list of currently monitored subscriptions appears. Use this view to configure the scope of the Datadog resource to monitor as many subscriptions as desired. The subscription with the Datadog resource must be included in the scope.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/azure-portal-multiple-subscriptions.png" alt="The Datadog resource in the Azure portal with Monitored Subscriptions selected in the Datadog organization configurations section and two subscriptions displayed" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

   - To add subscriptions to monitor, click `+ Add Subscriptions`. The list of subscriptions available only includes subscriptions to which you have the `Owner` role assigned. Select the subscriptions you wish to monitor and click `Add`. 
   - To remove subscriptions from being monitored with Datadog, select the subscriptions you wish to remove and click `Remove Subscriptions`. Only users with the `Owner` role can remove subscriptions.

**Note**: The same settings (such as host filters and log collection rules) are applied across all subscriptions in scope. To apply different settings to different subscriptions, create different Datadog resources.

### Metrics and logs

Select **Metrics and logs** in the left sidebar to change the configuration rules for metrics and logs. All rules are applied dynamically across the entire subscription as resources are added or tags change.

Changes to metric or log configuration settings should take effect within a few minutes.

#### Metric collection
By default, Datadog automatically collects metrics for all Azure resources within any linked subscriptions.

Optionally, limit metric collection for Azure VMs and App Service Plans using Azure tags attached to your resources. 

##### Tag rules for sending metrics
 
 * Virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and App Service Plans with `include` tags send metrics to Datadog.  
 * Virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and App Service Plans with `exclude` tags don't send metrics to Datadog.  
 * If there's a conflict between inclusion and exclusion rules, exclusion takes priority.  
 * There is no option to limit metric collection for other resource types.

#### Log collection

There are three types of logs that can be emitted from Azure to Datadog using the Datadog resource.

1. [Activity logs](#activity-logs)
2. [Resource logs](#resource-logs)
3. [Azure Active Directory logs](#azure-active-directory-logs)

##### Activity logs

Subscription level logs provide insight into the operations on your resources at the [control plane][3]. Updates on service health events are also included. Use the activity log to determine the what, who, and when for any write operations (`PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`).

To send subscription level logs to Datadog, select **Send subscription activity logs**. If this option is left unchecked, none of the subscription level logs are sent to Datadog.

##### Resource logs

Azure resource logs provide insight into operations taken on Azure resources at the [data plane][3]. For example, getting a secret from a key vault or making a request to a database are data plane operations. The content of resource logs varies by the Azure service and resource type.

To send Azure resource logs to Datadog, select **Send Azure resource logs for all defined resources**. The types of Azure resource logs are listed in the [Azure Monitor Resource Log categories][4]. When this option is selected, all resource logs are sent to Datadog, including any new resources created in the linked subscriptions.

You can optionally filter the set of Azure resources sending logs to Datadog using Azure resource tags.

###### Tag rules for sending logs

* Azure resources with `include` tags send logs to Datadog.
* Azure resources with `exclude` tags don't send logs to Datadog.
* If there's a conflict between inclusion and exclusion rules, exclusion takes priority.

For example, the screenshot below shows a tag rule where only virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and app service plans tagged with `Datadog = True` send metrics to Datadog. Resources (of all types) tagged with `Datadog = True` send logs to Datadog.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/metrics-and-logs-tag-rules.png" alt="A screenshot showing a metric tag rule of Datadog=true set for virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and app service plans. The logs section is also configured with tag rule of Datadog=true" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

##### Azure Active Directory logs

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) logs contain the history of sign-in activity and an audit trail of changes made in Azure AD for a particular tenant. To send Azure AD Logs:

1. Navigate to Azure Active Directory in Azure, and select **Diagnostic Settings** in the left navigation bar.
2. Click **Add diagnostic setting**.
3. Select the log categories you want to send to Datadog. Datadog recommends sending all categories.
4. In **Destination details**, select **Send to a partner solution**.
5. Select a subscription. Select a Datadog resource in the **Destination** dropdown.

All Azure AD logs from the tenant are sent to the Datadog organization linked to the Datadog resource selected. For cases where you have more than one Datadog resource that links subscriptions to the same Datadog organization, it does not matter which Datadog resource is selected. You only need to set this up once for each Azure tenant.

### Monitored resources

Select **Monitored Resources** in the left sidebar to see a list of resources emitting logs and metrics to Datadog. Use the search to filter the list by resource name, type, group, location, logs to Datadog, or metrics to Datadog.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/monitored-resources.png" alt="The Datadog resource page in the Azure portal with Monitored Resources highlighted under Datadog org configurations" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

The **Logs to Datadog** column displays `Sending` if the resource is sending logs to Datadog. Otherwise, this field indicates why logs aren't being sent. Possible reasons:

| Reason                                    | Description                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource doesn't support sending logs     | Only resource types with monitoring log categories can be configured to send logs to Datadog.                           |
| Limit of five diagnostic settings reached | Each Azure resource can have a maximum of five diagnostic settings. For more information, see [diagnostic settings][5]. |
| Error                                     | The resource is configured to send logs to Datadog, but is blocked by an error.                                         |
| Logs not configured                       | Only Azure resources with appropriate resource tags are configured to send logs to Datadog.                             |
| Region not supported                      | The Azure resource is in a region that doesn't support sending logs to Datadog.                                         |
| Datadog Agent not configured              | Virtual machines without the Datadog Agent installed don't emit logs to Datadog.                                        |

### Datadog Agent extensions

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "VM Extension" %}}

To see a list of virtual machines (VMs) in the subscription, select **Virtual machine agent** in the left sidebar. On this page, you can install the Datadog Agent on a VM as an extension.

#### Install

To install the [Datadog extension][6], select the appropriate app, then click **Install Extension**. The portal asks for confirmation to install the extension. Select **OK** to begin installation. This restarts your app and adds the following settings:

- `DD_API_KEY:<DEFAULT_API_KEY>`
- `DD_SITE:us3.datadoghq.com`
- `DD_LOGS_INJECTION:true`

Azure shows the status as `Installing` until the Agent is installed and provisioned. After the Datadog Agent is installed, the status changes to `Installed`.

**Note**: Ensure you are adding the extension to apps with [supported runtimes][7]. The Datadog resource does not limit or filter the list of apps.

#### Uninstall

To uninstall the Datadog extension, select the appropriate app, then click **Uninstall Extension**.

## Settings
### Single sign-on

Select **Single sign-on** in the left sidebar to reconfigure single sign-on.

To activate single sign-on through Azure Active Directory, select **Enable single sign-on**. The portal retrieves the appropriate Datadog application from Azure Active Directory. The app name is the enterprise app name you chose when setting up the integration. Select the Datadog application name as shown below.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/sso.png" alt="The Azure portal with Enable Single sign-on through Azure active directory enabled" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

### API keys

Select **Keys** in the left sidebar to view a list of API keys for your Datadog resource.

{{< img src="integrations/guide/azure_portal/api-keys.png" alt="The Keys view within the Azure portal displaying one API key" responsive="true" style="width:100%;">}}

The Azure portal provides a read-only view of the API keys. To manage the keys, select the "Datadog portal" link. After making changes in Datadog, refresh the Azure portal view.

The Azure Datadog integration allows you to install the Datadog Agent on a VM or app service. If there is no default key selected, a Datadog Agent installation fails.

### Cloud Security Management Misconfigurations

Select `Cloud Security Posture Management` in the left sidebar to configure [Cloud Security Management Misconfigurations (CSM Misconfigurations)][8].

By default, CSM Misconfigurations is not enabled. To enable CSM Misconfigurations, select `Enable Datadog Cloud Security Posture Management` and click **Save**. This enables Datadog CSM Misconfigurations for any subscriptions associated with the Datadog resource.

To disable, uncheck the box and click **Save**.
