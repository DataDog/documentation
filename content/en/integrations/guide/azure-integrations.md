## Overview

Datadog's Azure integration consists of an [app registration][1] with access to the subscriptions you want to monitor, and the app's credentials configured in Datadog. This allows you to forward your metrics, logs, configuration information, and cost data to Datadog for visibility and alerting.

{{% collapse-content title="Permissions required for integration setup" level="h4" expanded=false id="required-permissions" %}}

### Azure permissions

Your Microsoft Entra ID user needs the following permissions:

#### Permission to create an app registration

**One** of the following must be true for the user:

- `Users can register applications` has been set to `Yes`
- The user has the [Application Developer][58] role

#### Permission to assign roles within your subscriptions

You must have one of the [Azure built-in roles in the Privileged category][56], or a custom role including the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` action, in each of the subscriptions you wish to connect.

#### Permission to add and grant consent for Graph API permissions

The [Privileged Role Administrator role][57] contains the required permissions.

### Datadog permissions

The `Datadog Admin Role`, or any other role with the `azure_configurations_manage` permission.

## Azure service-specific integrations

Setting up the main Azure integration also installs all of Datadog's Azure service-specific integrations. These integrations provide metrics, service checks, and events that give you visibility into the health and behavior of a particular Azure service.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Datadog's Azure integration is built to collect <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported">all metrics from Azure Monitor</a>. Datadog strives to continually update the docs to show every sub-integration, but cloud services rapidly release new metrics and services so the list of integrations can sometimes lag.<br>The <code>azure.*.count</code> metric is generated by Datadog from Azure Resource Health. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/guide/azure-advanced-configuration/#count-metric">Count metric</a> in the Azure Advanced Configuration guide.

## Datadog-generated metrics

Datadog automatically queries other resource-specific Azure metadata APIs and uses that information to generate additional timeseries metrics. There are more than 40 Datadog-generated metrics and dozens of new tags for your Azure services, including:

- App Services
- Azure Functions
- App Service Plans
- Azure SQL Databases
- Azure Load Balancers
- Azure Virtual Networks
- Usage and quotas
- Resource counts and statuses

## Configuration

To limit metric collection for Azure-based hosts, open the integration tile for Azure. Select the **Configuration** tab, then open **App Registrations**. Enter a list of tags in the text box under **Metric Collection Filters**.

This list of tags in `<KEY>:<VALUE>` form is separated by commas and defines a filter used while collecting metrics. Wildcards such as `?` (for single characters) and `*` (for multiple characters) can also be used.

Only VMs that match one of the defined tags are imported into Datadog. The rest are ignored. VMs matching a given tag can also be excluded by adding `!` before the tag. For example:

```text
datadog:monitored,env:production,!env:staging,instance-type:c1.*
```

See the [Azure Advanced Configuration][60] guide for more configuration options.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

All standard Azure Monitor metrics plus [unique Datadog generated metrics][53]. You can also enable collection of custom metrics from Azure Application Insights under the **Metric Collection** tab in the [Azure integration page][54].

For a detailed list of metrics, select the appropriate Azure service in the [Azure service-specific integrations section](#azure-service-specific-integrations). To exclude certain VMs from metric collection, see [Azure VM Exclusion][55].

### Logs

See the [Azure automated log forwarding guide][61] to set up log forwarding from your Azure environment.

### Events

The Azure integration automatically collects Azure Service Health events. To view these in Datadog, navigate to the [Event explorer][50] and filter for the `Azure Service Health` namespace.

### Service Checks

The Azure integration does not include any service checks.

### Tags

Azure integration metrics, events, and service checks receive the following tags in addition to tags defined in your Azure environments:

**Note**: See the [Azure integration billing page][62] for information about billing.

## Next steps

- See [Getting Started with Azure][2] to set up the integration
- See [Azure Advanced Configuration][60] for detailed information about the architecture
- See [Azure Automated Log Forwarding][3] to automate the setup of log forwarding in your Azure environment. This log forwarding setup can also be configured through the [Azure Quickstart][] integration setup method.
