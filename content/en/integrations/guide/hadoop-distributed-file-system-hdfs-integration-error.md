If you are encountering errors when integrating with HDFS, first try upgrading pip and Snakebite by following these steps:

1. Run: /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
2. Run: /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install --upgrade snakebite
3. [Restart the Agent][1].

If these steps do not resolve your error, contact [Datadog Support][2].
