## Overview

Use this guide to manually set up the Datadog Azure Native integration through creation of the Datadog resource in Azure.

The Datadog resource streamlines management and data collection for your Azure environment. Datadog recommends using this method when possible. This replaces the App Registration credential process used by the standard Azure integration for metric collection and Event Hub setup for log forwarding.

### Prerequisites

#### Required permissions

To set up the Azure Native integration, you must be an **Owner** on any Azure subscriptions you want to link, and **Admin** for the Datadog organization you are linking them to. Ensure you have the appropriate access before starting the setup.

## Setup

Configuring the Azure integration requires the creation of a Datadog resource in Azure. These resources represent the connection or link between a Datadog organization and an Azure subscription. Multiple Azure subscriptions can be connected to Datadog with a single Datadog resource. 

There are two options when you create a Datadog resource in Azure:

1. Link to an existing Datadog organization. This is the more common action. Use this to configure your Datadog org to monitor an Azure subscription that hasn't been linked yet. This action does not affect your Datadog billing plan.

2. Create a new Datadog organization. This flow is less common. Use this if you do not yet have a Datadog org and you want to get started with a paid plan through Azure Marketplace. This flow creates a brand new Datadog org, allows you to select a billing plan, and links the associated Azure subscription for monitoring.

**Note**: Trials are not available through the **Create a new Datadog organization** option in Azure. To get started with a free trial, first [create a trial Datadog org on the US3 site][1]. Then use the linking flow to add any subscriptions you want to monitor.

Once you create a Datadog resource, data collection begins for the associated subscription. See details for using this resource to configure, manage, and deploy Datadog in the [Managing the Azure Native Integration][2] guide.

### Create a Datadog resource

To start monitoring an Azure subscription, navigate to the [Datadog Service page in Azure][3] and select the option to create a new Datadog resource:
{{< img src="integrations/azure/azure-us3-dd-service.png" alt="Azure US3 Datadog Service" responsive="true" style="width:90%;">}}

Choose **Link Azure subscription to an existing Datadog organization** or **Create a new Datadog organization**. Linking is the more common action. Use this to configure monitoring for an Azure subscription that hasn't been linked yet. Only choose the **Create** flow if you are not yet a Datadog customer and want to get started with a new, paid plan.

{{< img src="integrations/azure/azure-us3-create-dd-resource1.png" alt="Azure US3 create a Datadog resource" responsive="true" style="width:90%;">}}

**Note**: New Datadog organizations created through the Azure portal automatically have billing consolidated into their Azure invoice. This usage counts towards your organization's [MACC][4] if applicable.

### SSO configuration

_(Optional)_: You can configure [single sign-on (SSO)][5] during the process of creating a new Datadog organization in Azure. You can also configure SSO later. To configure SSO during the initial creation, first create a Datadog enterprise gallery app.

### Configuration {#configuration-us3}

#### Basics {#basics-link}

After selecting to link to an existing Datadog organization, the portal displays a form for creating the Datadog resource:
{{< img src="integrations/azure/azure-us3-link-sub.png" alt="Link Azure subscription to an existing Datadog organization" responsive="true" style="width:90%;">}}

Provide the following values:

| Property             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subscription         | The Azure subscription you want to monitor with Datadog. The Datadog resource exists in this subscription. You must have owner access.                                                                                       |
| Resource group       | Create a new resource group or use an existing one. A [resource group][5] is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.                                                                                 |
| Resource name        | Specify a name for the Datadog resource. The recommended naming convention is: `subscription_name-datadog_org_name`.                                                                                                         |
| Location             | The location is West US2—this is the location where Datadog's US3 site is hosted in Azure. This has no impact on your use of Datadog. Like all [Datadog sites][1], the US3 site is entirely SaaS and supports monitoring all Azure regions as well as other cloud providers and on-premises hosts. |
| Datadog organization | After the authentication step is completed, the Datadog organization name is set to the name of the Datadog organization being linked. The Datadog site is set to US3.                                                                                                                                |

Click **Link to Datadog organization** to open a Datadog authentication window, then sign in to Datadog.

By default, Azure links your current Datadog organization to your Datadog resource. If you want to link to a different organization, select the appropriate organization in the authentication window:

{{< img src="integrations/azure/azure-us3-select-org.png" alt="Azure US3 select Datadog organization" responsive="true" style="width:90%;">}}

When the OAuth flow is complete, verify the Datadog organization name is correct.

#### Install

You can install the Datadog Agent directly in Azure with the VM Extension. To install the Datadog Agent: 

1. Select the appropriate VM.
2. Click **Install Extension**. 
3. The portal asks for confirmation to install the Agent with the default key. Select **OK** to begin installation. Azure shows the status as `Installing` until the Agent is installed and provisioned. After the Datadog Agent is installed, the status changes to `Installed`.

#### Uninstall

If the Datadog Agent was installed with the Azure VM extension:

1. Select the appropriate VM.
2. Click **Uninstall Agent**.

If the Agent was installed using a different method, you cannot use the Datadog resource to deploy or remove the Agent, but information about the Agent is still reflected on this page.

{{% /tab %}}
