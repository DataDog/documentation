## Overview

This page walks you through how Prometheus or OpenMetrics check metrics map to existing Datadog metric types.

## Prometheus and OpenMetrics metric types

* `counter`: A cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter, whose value can only increaseâ€”or be reset to zero.
* `gauge`: A metric that represents a single numeric value, which can arbitrarily go up and down.
* `histogram`: Samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets; also provides a sum of all observed values.
* `summary`: Similar to `histogram`; samples observations, provides a sum of all observed values, and calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.

## How Prometheus/OpenMetrics metrics map to Datadog metrics

| Metric Type | OpenMetrics | Datadog | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [counter][110] | `counter` | `count` |
| [gauge][111] | `gauge` | `gauge` |
| [histogram][112] | `_count`, `_sum`, `_bucket` | The `_count`, `_sum`, and `_bucket` values of the histogram are each mapped to Datadog's `count` type and include a `.count`, `.sum`, and `.bucket` suffix, respectively. |
| [summary][113] | `_count`, `_sum`, `_created` | The `_count` and `_sum` values are mapped to Datadog's `count` type and include a `.count` and `.sum` suffix in their name, respectively. Quantile samples are mapped to a metric of type `gauge` with the `.quantile` suffix. | 

### Histogram

For [Prometheus/OpenMetrics `histogram`][104], the `_count`, `_sum`, and `_bucket` values of the histogram are each mapped to Datadog's `count` type and include a `.count`, `.sum`, and `.bucket` suffix in their names, respectively.

If the `histogram_buckets_as_distributions` parameter is `true`, `_bucket` samples are aggregated into a Datadog `distribution`. [Datadog distribution metrics][108] are based on the [DDSketch algorithm][109] and allow for more advanced statistical aggregations such as quantiles. For more information, see the Datadog Engineering Blog [post on OpenMetrics and distribution metrics][105].

`collect_counters_with_distributions` can be used to send `_count` and `_sum` values as `count`s alongside the distribution.


### Summary

For [Prometheus/OpenMetrics `summary`][107], `_count` and `_sum` values are mapped to Datadog's `count` type and include a `.count` and `.sum` suffix in their name, respectively. Quantile samples are mapped to a metric of type `gauge` with the `.quantile` suffix.

### Counter

By default, [Prometheus/OpenMetrics `counter`][101] maps to Datadog's `count`.

However, if the parameter `send_monotonic_counter` is `false`, then this metric is sent as `gauge`.

### Gauge

[Prometheus/OpenMetrics `gauge`][103] maps to Datadog's `gauge`.

### Histogram

For [Prometheus/OpenMetrics `histogram`][104], the `_count` and `_sum` values of the histogram are each mapped to Datadog's `gauge` type and include a `.count` and `.sum` suffix in their name, respectively.

If the `send_histograms_buckets` parameter is `true`, `_bucket` samples are sent to Datadog with a `.bucket` suffix, and are also mapped to Datadog's `gauge` by default.

Setting the `send_distribution_counts_as_monotonic` parameter to `true` causes the `_count` and `_bucket` metrics to be sent as type `count` instead. Setting `send_distribution_sums_as_monotonic` does the same for `_sum` metrics.

If the `send_distribution_buckets` parameter is `true`, `_bucket` samples are aggregated into a Datadog `distribution`. [Datadog distribution metrics][108] are based on the [DDSketch algorithm][107], and allow for more advanced statistical aggregations such as quantiles. For more information, see the Datadog Engineering Blog [post on OpenMetrics and distribution metrics][106].


### Summary

For [Prometheus/OpenMetrics `summary`][105], `_count` and `_sum` values are mapped to Datadog's `gauge` type by default, and include a `.count` and `.sum` suffix in their names, respectively. Quantile samples are mapped to a metric of type `gauge` with the `.quantile` suffix.

Setting the `send_distribution_counts_as_monotonic` parameter to `true` causes the `_count` and `_sum` metrics to be sent as type `count` instead. Setting `send_distribution_sums_as_monotonic` does the same for `_sum` metrics.

<div class="alert alert-info">All <code>count</code> metrics are processed by the Agent as <em>monotonic counts</em>, meaning the Agent actually sends the difference between consecutive raw values.
