The Software Delivery tab in Service Catalog provides several ways to assess and improve the pre-production status of your services. This includes understanding the status of your CI pipelines and viewing your static analysis violations. You can:

- View performance of the CI pipelines related to your services.
- Find security and code quality issues from Static Analysis.
- Easily pivot from Service Catalog to troubleshoot pre-production slowdowns and failures.
- See your Change Lead Time by integrating with DORA Metrics.

By default, your service is associated with CI pipeline(s) through a repository URL. You can edit the pipelines associated with each service by modifying the ci-pipeline-fingerprints field in your service metadata.

To add or remove a pipeline associated with your service, click Edit Metadata in your service page, and go to Software Delivery. Please note that this is only available for Service Catalog schema v2.2.

There are two ways to add or remove an associated pipeline:

1. Search for and select the pipelines you want to associate.

2. Add the pipeline fingerprint directly to the service metadata. You can locate a pipelineâ€™s fingerprint by clicking on a pipeline in the Pipelines page, then click the gear icon:
