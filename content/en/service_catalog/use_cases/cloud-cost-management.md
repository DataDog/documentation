Datadogâ€™s [Service Catalog][4], [Scorecards][2], and [Workflow Automation][5] enable organizations to monitor and optimize cloud costs with team-level granularity, ensuring appropriate cost allocation and protocol compliance.

## Proactively monitor cost spikes

[Datadog's Cloud Cost Management][1] integrates with the Service Catalog to detect and alert on cost anomalies in real time. Teams can quickly investigate spikes by correlating them with service-level changes like traffic fluctuations, deployments, or PR merges.

## Ensure cost compliance and transparency

Teams can monitor and optimize cost allocation by tagging cloud resources and tracking compliance with [Scorecards][2]. 

For example, you can enable team-level cost tracking by applying the tag "team" to infrastructure components and setting a custom scorecard rule to enforce this practice. 

Datadog offers preconfigured [Workflow blueprints][3] to help you build cost management processes. You can use the blueprints as-is or modify the evaluation logic to fit your use case.
