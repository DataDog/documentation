Clicking on a service opens a side panel with details including:

- **Ownership information** from the service definition such as links to team contacts, source code, and supplemental information like documentation and dashboards.
- **Reliability information** including deployment status, SLOs, ongoing incidents, and error information.
- **Performance graphs** showing requests, errors, latency, and time spent by downstream services.
- **Security information** including known vulnerabilities exposed in the service's libraries, the timeline and type of attacks, identity of attackers, security threats impacting your services, and the ability to download the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from the libraries tab. 
- **Pre-production information** regarding your software delivery process, such as the average build duration and success rate of CI pipelines related to your service, along with static analysis results from CI.

- **Configuration completeness status** for Datadog products that can collect data for the service.
- **Service definition** in YAML with a link to the service's source code.
- An interactive service map displaying services upstream and downstream from this service.
- **Beta: Active library configuration** for Java and .NET services with the latest Agent configured with [Remote Configuration][1] enabled, you can adjust the [trace sampling rate][3] (from 0.0 to 1.0), enable [Log Injection][2] to correlate traces and logs data, and specify HTTP header tags to be applied to all traces coming into Datadog from this service. In the Setup Guidance tab, beside **Active Library Configuration**, click **Edit** to change these settings and immediately apply them without restarting the service.

Click **View Related** and select a page from the dropdown menu to navigate into related pages in Datadog, such as the APM Service page and service map for this service, or related telemetry data pages, such as Distributed Tracing, Infrastructure, Network Performance, Log Management, RUM, and Continuous Profiler.
