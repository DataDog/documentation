## Overview

The Service Catalog's [Endpoints list][12] consolidates everything you need to know about your API endpoints. It provides a comprehensive view of performance, reliability, and ownership across all your APIs, whether they serve internal teams or external users. This helps you and your teams effectively monitor mission-critical, API-driven features and ensure they meet performance expectations.

## Use cases

The Endpoints list combines data from across Datadog to provide opinionated workflows. You can do the following:

- **Discover APIs automatically**: Maintain a complete inventory of your public, private, and partner APIs, organized by endpoint.
- **Surface correlated data**: Navigate from endpoints to traces, logs, and metrics from different Datadog sources.
- **Identify performance issues**: Use metrics such as *Last Seen*, *Requests*, *Latency*, and *Errors* to track API health.
- **Receive alerts**: Define performance expectations and thresholds that trigger alerts.
- **Assign ownership information**: Set teams, on-call, and communication channel information to each endpoint so you know whom to reach when errors occur.
- **Ensure comprehensive coverage**: Track the status of API monitors, synthetic tests, and security signals, with direct links to detailed information for investigations.

## Getting started

Your endpoints automatically populate in the Endpoints list if you use [Datadog APM][8] to monitor HTTP services.

### Exploring endpoints

Browse and query properties and metrics that are related to your endpoints.

Read [Exploring Endpoints][11] for more information.

### Monitoring endpoints

Manage and monitor your APIs and endpoints to:

- Find and fix underperforming endpoints.
- Track their reliability against standards and objectives.
- Watch for anomalies.
- Investigate errors.
- Ensure test coverage.
- Close security gaps.

Read [Monitoring Endpoints][7] for more information.

### Assigning owners to endpoints

Add ownership information to endpoints to streamline investigations and team communication.

Read [Assigning Owners][6] for more information.

### Adding endpoints to the list

Assign automatically detected endpoints to API groups to track usage, define ownership, and configure monitoring policies from a centralized location. Alternatively, upload an OpenAPI or Swagger file to unlock the full capabilities of the Endpoints list.

Read [Adding Entries][9] for more information.

### Adding metadata to APIs

Add metadata to APIs through the Datadog UI or API, or use automated pipelines through the GitHub integration or Terraform.

Read [Adding Metadata to APIs][10] for more information.

## Key terminology

| Term         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API          | A set of protocols and tools that allows two applications to communicate.                                                                                                                                                      |
| API endpoint | The address (URL) of a resource of a server or service that implements the rules defined in the API, often through an HTTP or RESTful interface. The API endpoint processes requests and provides the corresponding responses. |
| Public APIs  | Customer-facing API endpoints that are accessible from the internet.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Private APIs | Also called *internal APIs*. These are designed exclusively for internal use within an organization and are used mainly for backend service communication. These are the most common type of API.                                                   |
| Partner APIs | Also called *third-party APIs*. These are public endpoints provided by another organization (for example, Stripe, Google, or Facebook) that your organization uses to provide its services.                                             |
