## Automatic discovery

Datadog Service Catalog is pre-populated with entries detected through [APM][2], eBPF-based autodiscovery with [Universal Service Monitoring][1], and RUM applications.

With APM, Datadog can automatically discover the dependencies for an instrumented service, such as a database, a queue, or a third-party dependencies, even if that dependency hasn't been instrumented yet. These uninstrumented dependencies are categorized as separate *services*. Datadog changed service names of client spans (span.kind:client) to represent dependencies of your instrumented services. For example, a span representing a client call from a service auth-dotnet to a PostgreSQL database would be tagged with service:auth-dotnet-postgres. 

If you are using APM and would like to remove the automatically named *services* from your Service Catalog and Service Map, you can opt in to new [inferred entities experience][7], which allows you to filter Service Catalog entries by entity type, such as database, queue, or third-party dependencies. You can optionally [remove][8] any [service overrides][9] like service:my-service-http-client from your catalog or map. 

## Enrich auto-detected services with metadata 
To specify on-call, source code, or documentation for your services, you can add metadata to any existing services using the UI, APIs, or [other automation][10]. 2.2 is the recommended version. To try experimental features like enhanced relationship mapping and precise code location, opt in to the beta program for [schema 3.0][3] by [submitting a request][4].

### Service Definition Schema (v2.2) (Recommended)

The Service Definition Schema is a structure that contains basic information about a service. See the [full schema on GitHub][5].

## Find Service Catalog actions
To explore the complete set of actions specifically related to Service Catalog, navigate to the [Datadog Action Catalog][6]. Filter for the actions you need:

1. **Access the Action Catalog**: Look for the Action Catalog within your Datadog Workflow Automation environment.
2. **Search Functionality**: Use the search bar to search for keywords like "Service Catalog" or more specific terms related to desired actions (for example, "get service dependencies").

### Available Service Catalog Actions

Below is a comprehensive list of actions available for Service Catalog in Datadog Workflow Automation. Note that this list may evolve as new actions are added. 

- **Retrieve Service Information**
  - "Get service definition" for a single service
  - "List service definitions" to get all definitions from Datadog Service Catalog
  - "Get service dependencies" to get a service's immediate upstream and downstream services
- **Incident Triage**
  - "Get service PagerDuty on call"
  - When integrated with other actions, you can trigger workflows based on critical events (for example, execute runbooks). 

## Change the service color
The service color is used in trace visualizations. Click the service type icon to change it.

{{< img src="tracing/service_catalog/change_service_color.png" alt="Click the service icon to select a different icon color." style="width:80%;" >}}

## Update the service type and language
With [Service Catalog metadata schema 2.2][5], you can specify the type and language for user-defined services or overwrite the auto-detected type and language for instrumented services. Correctly label the service type and language to help other teams further understand what your services do and how to interact with them.
