## Automate developer workflows
Use [App Builder][2] to create dynamic, user-friendly forms to collect inputs from developers. Call Datadog's [Actions][7] from your app to initiate API calls to external services, perform custom logic, or data transformations. Orchestrate end-to-end processes of multiple actions using [Workflow Automation][1]. Integrate them with Datadog's Service Catalog to enable dynamic and self-service workflows.

  Software Templates are in Preview. Complete the form to request access.

### Create software template workflows
To use software templates in Datadog, create a Git repository with the desired template. You can start from scratch or use our quickstart blueprints to learn from an example.

#### Start from a blueprint
Navigate to [App Builder Blueprints][9] and select one of the following blueprints:

##### Scaffold New Service

The [Scaffold New Service blueprint][11] shows an example of scaffolding a new lambda function from a template. The form captures inputs from a developer that will be passed into the corresponding Git repo.

1. From the app, customize the form to include the parameters you want to capture from your developers.
2. Click **Save as New App** to save the app. This will also create a corresponding templating workflow.

##### Create S3 Bucket with Terraform

The [Create S3 Bucket with Terraform blueprint][10] shows an example of creating the terraform for an S3 bucket from a form in Github.

#### Start from scratch
Navigate to the [Workflow Automation][3] page to configure the template in Datadog.

1. [Create a workflow][6] for your template:
   - From the [Workflow Automation][3] page, click **New Workflow**. 
   - Enter a name, add relevant tags, and define the input parameters you want to collect from users.
  
2. Configure the templating workflow:
   - Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [actions][7] to retrieve your template files.
   - Use Cookiecutter to generate the project files from the template.
   - Use the Apply Template [action][7] to manipulate your template repository and pass in your input parameters.
   - Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [actions][7] to upload the project files to the repository.
   - Save the workflow.

3. Create the form for your template:
   - Navigate to **Service Mgmt** > **App Builder** and select **New App**.
   - Enter a name and description, and use the drag-and-drop editor to create a form that collects the required parameters for your template.
   - Select **New Query**, and use the **Trigger workflow** action to call your templating workflow and pass in the relevant parameters.
   - Create a **Button** that submits the form, triggers your workflow, and passes in the parameters for the template.
   - Save and publish the app.

4. Run your application and workflow:
   - Click **View App** to view the app on a standalone page, or **Add to a Dashboard** to place the app in a dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Service Mgmt** > **App Builder**, and select your app. Fill out the template form, and click the submit button.
   - Track the success of the workflow templating process in [Workflow Automation][3].
