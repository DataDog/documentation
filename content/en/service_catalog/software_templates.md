## Automate common workflows
Use [Workflow Automation][1] and [App Builder][2] to automate end-to-end processes. Integrate them with Datadog's Service Catalog to enable dynamic and self-service workflows.

### Create software template workflows using Cookiecutter
To use software templates in Datadog, create a git repository with the desired template. Then, navigate to the [Workflow Automation][3] page to configure the template in Datadog. A common choice for templating is [Cookiecutter][4], an open source project for project templates and auto-generating new projects. Check out [this gist][5] for a quick-start guide, or complete the following steps.

1. [Create a workflow][6] for your template:
   - From the [Workflow Automation][3] page, click **New Workflow**. 
   - Enter a name, add relevant tags, and define the input parameters you want to collect from users.
  
2. Configure the templating workflow:
   - Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [workflow actions][7] to retrieve your template files.
   - Use Cookiecutter to generate the project files from the template.
     - Tip: Create and invoke an [AWS lambda function][8] to generate the project with Cookiecutter.
   - Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [workflow actions][7] to upload the project files to the repository.
   - Save the workflow.

3. Create your templating app:
   - Navigate to **Service Mgmt** > **App Builder** and select **New App**.
   - Enter a name and description, and use the drag-and-drop editor to create a form that collects the required parameters for your template.
   - Select **New Query**, and use the **Trigger workflow** action to call your templating workflow and pass in the relevant parameters.
   - Create a **Button** that submits the form, triggers your workflow, and passes in the parameters for the template.
   - Save and publish the app.

4. Run your application and workflow:
   - Click **View App** to view the app on a standalone page, or **Add to a Dashboard** to place the app in a dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Service Mgmt** > **App Builder**, and select your app. Fill out the template form, and click the submit button.
   - Track the success of the workflow templating process in [Workflow Automation][3].

### Find Service Catalog actions
To explore the complete set of actions specifically related to Service Catalog, navigate to the [Datadog Action Catalog][7]. Filter for the actions you need:

1. **Access the Action Catalog**: Look for the Action Catalog within your Datadog Workflow Automation environment.
2. **Search Functionality**: Use the search bar to search for keywords like "Service Catalog" or more specific terms related to desired actions (for example, "get service dependencies").

### Available Service Catalog Actions

Below is a comprehensive list of actions available for Service Catalog in Datadog Workflow Automation. Note that this list may evolve as new actions are added. 

- **Retrieve Service Information**
  - "Get service definition" for a single service
  - "List service definitions" to get all definitions from Datadog Service Catalog
  - "Get service dependencies" to get a service's immediate upstream and downstream services
- **Incident Triage**
  - "Get service PagerDuty on call"
  - When integrated with other actions, you can trigger workflows based on critical events (for example, execute runbooks).
