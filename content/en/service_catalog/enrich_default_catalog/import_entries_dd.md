## Manual Service Discovery through other Datadog telemetries

To discover additional services through existing Datadog telemetry such as infrastructure metrics, navigate to the [**Setup & Config** tab][3] on the top of the page and click on the **Import Entries** tab. You can import services from other Datadog telemetry containing the `DD_SERVICE` [tag][5].

After you have imported some entries, they appear in the **Explore** tab. Entries may expire unless you add metadata such as the owner or contacts by [using the API][1] or the [GitHub integration][6].

To remove your imported services from the default **Explore** view, click **Clear Previously Imported Services**. This removes all services that do not have metadata or do not have APM, Universal Service Monitoring (USM), or Real User Monitoring (RUM) telemetry.
