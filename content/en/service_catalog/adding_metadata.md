## Overview

You can add metadata to existing Service Catalog entries through the Datadog UI, API, or use automated pipelines through the GitHub integration or Terraform.

## Metadata structure and supported versions

Service Catalog uses service definition schemas to store and display relevant metadata about your services. The schemas have built-in validation rules to ensure that only valid values are accepted and you can view warnings in the **Definition** tab on the side panel for any selected services. 

There are three supported versions of the schema:

- V2 is the earliest version, and contains some experimental features, such as `dd-team`, which are removed from v2.1.
- V2.1 supports additional UI elements such as service groupings and fields like `application`, `tier`, and `lifecycle`. `Application`, along with Teams, can be used as grouping variables in Service Catalog. `Lifecycle` helps you differentiate between `production`, `experimental`, or `deprecated` services to indicate development stages and apply different reliability and availability requirements. `Tier` indicates the criticality of services, to prioritize during incident triage. For example, `tier 1` typically represents the most critical services whose failure would result in severe customer impact, whereas `tier 4` services typically have no impacts on actual customer experience.
- V2.2 supports user annotation and overwriting auto-detected service type and languages using the fields `type` and `languages`. It also adds support for associating CI pipelines with a service using the field `ci-pipeline-fingerprints`. This version also includes less restrictive validation logic for `contact.type` and `link.type`, so users should expect fewer warnings while submitting YAML.
- V3.0 adds a `kind` field that supports schemas for additional component types including applications, internal and external libraries, queues, and datastores. Any components within an `application` implicitly inherit its metadata. Furthermore, this version supports manually declaring dependency relationships, in addition to the auto-detected topology through Distributed Tracing and Universal Service Monitoring.

For more information about the latest updates, see the schemas on GitHub.

## Add metadata from the Datadog UI 

If your service is listed in Service Catalog and already has metadata associated with it, the original source is listed in the **Metadata Source** column on the **Ownership** view. Return to that source to make any updates you need to make.

If the service has not been assigned any service definition metadata, or if the service isn't listed in the Service Catalog yet, you can add it:

1. On the [Service Catalog][10] page, click **Setup & Config**. The **Manage Entries** tabs shows you how many services are without metadata.

2. Click **Create New Entry**.

3. Specify which service you are adding metadata to. This can be the name of a service already listed in the Service Catalog that doesn't have service definition metadata defined for it yet, or it can be the name of a service not sending any data.

4. Enter details for Team, On-call, Contacts, Documentation, Code repo, and Other links.

4. Switch to the **Code** view to see the JSON and cURL generated for the metadata you've entered. You can copy this code as a jumping off point for programmatically providing service definitions by API, Terraform, or GitHub, without having to learn the schema for service definitions.

5. If you have the [Service Catalog Write][13] permission, you can submit the metadata by clicking **Save Entry**, or by running the cURL command provided on the **Code** view.

## Automation options for adding metadata

### Store and edit service definitions in GitHub

Configure the [GitHub integration][6] to directly link from where you view the service's definition in the Service Catalog to where it's stored and editable in GitHub.

To install the GitHub integration, navigate to the [integration tile][7] and click **Link GitHub Account** in the **Repo Configuration** tab. 

#### Service definition YAML files

Datadog scans for the `service.datadog.yaml` file at the root of each repository with read permissions. You can register multiple services in one YAML file by creating multiple YAML documents. Separate each document with three dashes (`---`).

#### Modify service definition

When the GitHub integration is set up for your service definitions, an **Edit in Github** button appears in the service's **Definition** tab and links you to GitHub to commit changes.

{{< img src="tracing/service_catalog/svc_cat_contextual_link.png" alt="An Edit in Github button appears in the Definition tab of a service in the Service Catalog" style="width:90%;" >}}

After you update the YAML files for your repositories, your changes propagate to the Service Catalog. 

To prevent accidental overwriting, create and modify your service definition files with either the GitHub integration or the [Service Definition API endpoints][3]. Updating the same service using both the GitHub and the API may result in unintended overwriting.  

### Automate service definition updates with Terraform

The Service Catalog provides a service definition as a [Terraform resource][14]. Creating and managing services in the Service Catalog through automated pipelines requires [Datadog Provider][8] v3.16.0 or later.

For more information, see the [Datadog Provider documentation][9].

### Open-source metadata provider

As an alternative to the GitHub integration and Terraform, you can use an open-sourced GitHub Action solution named [Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider][12]. 

This GitHub Action allows you to register your services with the Service Catalog using a GitHub Action, with full control over when this information is sent to Datadog, and implement other compliance checks unique to your organization.

## Build custom extensions 

The `extensions` field is supported in all versions including v2. You can incorporate this custom field into deployment processes to standardize and codify best practices.
