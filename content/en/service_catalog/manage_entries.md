## Automatic service discovery

Datadog Service Catalog includes both eBPF-based autodiscovery with [Universal Service Monitoring][17] and distributed tracing based detection with [APM][18]. RUM applications are included in the Service Catalog as well. If you are using any of these products, your catalog is pre-populated with entries.

## Enrich auto-detected services with metadata 
To specify on-call, source code, or documentation for your services, you can add metadata to any existing services via the UI, APIs, or other automation. 2.2 is the recommended version. To try experimental features, you can opt into the beta program for [schema 3.0][21] by [submitting a request][22].

### Service Definition Schema (v2.2) (Recommended)

The Service Definition Schema is a structure that contains basic information about a service. See the [full schema on GitHub][19].

## Automate common workflows
Use [Workflow Automation][14] and [App Builder][24] to automate end-to-end processes. Integrate them with Datadog's Service Catalog to enable dynamic and self-service workflows.

{{< callout url="https://forms.gle/6Er52qd3BCERhotg7" d_target="#signupModal" btn_hidden="false">}}
  Software Templates are in private beta. Complete the form to request access.

### Create software template workflows using Cookiecutter
To use software templates in Datadog, create a git repository with the desired template. Then, navigate to the [Workflow Automation][26] page to configure the template in Datadog. A common choice for templating is [Cookiecutter][25], an open source project for project templates and auto-generating new projects. Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/enbashi/366c62ee8c5fc350d52ddabc867602d4#file-readme-md) for a quick-start guide, or complete the following steps.

1. [Create a workflow][27] for your template:
   - From the [Workflow Automation][26] page, click **New Workflow**. 
   - Enter a name, add relevant tags, and define the input parameters you want to collect from users.
  
2. Configure the templating workflow:
   - Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [workflow actions][28] to retrieve your template files.
   - Use Cookiecutter to generate the project files from the template.
     - Tip: Create and invoke an [AWS lambda function][29] to generate the project with Cookiecutter.
   - Use GitHub, Gitlab, or HTTP [workflow actions][28] to upload the project files to the repository.
   - Save the workflow.

3. Create your templating app:
   - Navigate to **Service Mgmt** > **App Builder** and select **New App**.
   - Enter a name and description, and use the drag-and-drop editor to create a form that collects the required parameters for your template.
   - Select **New Query**, and use the **Trigger workflow** action to call your templating workflow and pass in the relevant parameters.
   - Create a **Buttom** that submits the form, triggers your workflow, and passes in the parameters for the template.
   - Save and publish the app.

4. Run your application and workflow:
   - Click **View App** to view the app on a standalone page, or **Add to a Dashboard** to place the app in a dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Service Mgmt** > **App Builder**, and select your app. Fill out the template form, and click the submit button.
   - Track the success of the workflow templating process in [Workflow Automation][26].

### Find Service Catalog actions
To explore the complete set of actions specifically related to Service Catalog, navigate to the [Datadog Action Catalog][23]. Filter for the actions you need:

1. **Access the Action Catalog**: Look for the Action Catalog within your Datadog Workflow Automation environment.
2. **Search Functionality**: Use the search bar to search for keywords like "Service Catalog" or more specific terms related to desired actions (for example, "get service dependencies").

### Available Service Catalog Actions

Below is a comprehensive list of actions available for Service Catalog in Datadog Workflow Automation. Note that this list may evolve as new actions are added. 

- **Retrieve Service Information**
  - "Get service definition" for a single service
  - "List service definitions" to get all definitions from Datadog Service Catalog
  - "Get service dependencies" to get a service's immediate upstream and downstream services
- **Incident Triage**
  - "Get service PagerDuty on call"
  - When integrated with other actions, you can trigger workflows based on critical events (for example, execute runbooks). 

## Change the service color
The service color is used in trace visualizations. Click the service type icon to change it.

{{< img src="tracing/service_catalog/change_service_color.png" alt="Click the service icon to select a different icon color." style="width:80%;" >}}

## Update the service type and language
With [Service Catalog metadata schema 2.2][19], you can specify the type and language for user-defined services or overwrite the auto-detected type and language for instrumented services. Correctly label the service type and language to help other teams further understand what your services do and how to interact with them.
