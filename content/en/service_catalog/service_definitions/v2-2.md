## Overview

Schema v2.2 introduces support for user annotations, overwriting auto-detected service types and languages, and associating CI pipelines with services.

## Key features

- User annotations
- Overwriting auto-detected service type and languages using `type` and `languages`
- Associate CI pipeline with a service using `ci-pipeline-fingerprints`
- Less restrictive validation logic for `contact.type` and `link.type`

## Schema structure

The [full schema is available on GitHub][1].
