## Key features

- New UI elements such as service groupings and fields for `application`, `tier`, and `lifecycle`
- `Application` and `Teams` can be used as grouping variables in Service Catalog
- `Lifecycle` field indicates development stage to differentiate between `production`, `experimental`, or `deprecated` services
- `Tier` field indicates service criticality for prioritizing during incident triage

## Schema structure

The [full schema is available on GitHub][1].
