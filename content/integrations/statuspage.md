## Overview

Capture incidents from the StatusPage of your third-party services to correlate incidents with your own metrics and events. This integration does not require having your own StatusPage.io account.

## Configuration

After you activate the integration tile, enter the StatusPage.io page for whichever service you want to monitor. For instance, the PagerDuty status page can be found at https://status.pagerduty.com. Enter any custom tags you wish to associate with the page and click on **Update Configuration**.
