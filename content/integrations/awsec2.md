Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your EC2 metrics, and additional events like scheduled maintenances.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). There are no other installation steps that need to be performed.

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that EC2 is checked under metric collection.
