## Overview

Any Cloud Foundry deployment can send metrics and events to Datadog. The data helps you track the health and availability of all nodes in the deployment, monitor the jobs they run, collect metrics from the Loggregator Firehose, and more.
Use this page to learn how to monitor your [application on Cloud Foundry](#monitor-your-applications-on-cloud-foundry) and your [Cloud Foundry cluster](#monitor-your-cloud-foundry-cluster).

For Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you have the option to install the Datadog integration tiles with Ops Manager:

* [Datadog Cluster Monitoring for PCF][23]
* [Datadog Application Monitoring for PCF][24]

## Monitor Your Applications on Cloud Foundry

Use **Datadog Cloud Foundry Buildpack** to monitor your Cloud Foundry application. This is a [supply buildpack][1] for Cloud Foundry that installs a [Datadog DogStatsD binary][2] and [Datadog Trace Agent][3] in the container your app is running on.

### Setup

#### Cloud Foundry < 1.12

Our buildpack uses Cloud Foundry [multi-buildpack][4] feature that was introduced in version `1.12`.

For older version, Cloud Foundry provides a back-port of this feature in the form of a [buildpack][25]. You must install and configure this backport in order to use our buildpack:

1. **Upload the multi-buildpack back-port.**
  Download the latest [multi-build pack release][25] and upload it to your Cloud Foundry environment.

    ```shell
    cf create-buildpack multi-buildpack ./multi-buildpack-v-x.y.z.zip 99 --enable
    ```

2. **Add a multi-buildpack manifest to your application.**
  As detailed [on the multi-buildpack back-port repo][26], create a `multi-buildpack.yml` file at the root of your application and configure it for your environment.
  Add a link to the Datadog Cloud Foundry Buildpack and to your regular buildpack:

      ```yaml
      buildpacks:
        - "https://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack-3.1.0.zip"
        - "https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack#v1.7.18" # Replace this with your regular buildpack
      ```

    The URLs for the Datadog Buildpack are :

    - `https://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack-latest.zip`
    - `https://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack/datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack-x.y.z.zip`

    You should not use the `latest` here but instead pin it to a specific version (replace `x.y.z` by the specific version you want to use).

    **Important**: Your regular buildpack should probably be the last in the manifest to act as a final buildpack. To learn more refer to [cloud foundry documentation][27] about buildpacks.

3. **Push your application with the multi-buildpack**
  Ensure that the `multi-buildpack` is the buildpack selected by Cloud Foundry for your application :

    ```shell
    cf push <YOUR_APP> -b multi-buildpack
    ```

#### Cloud Foundry >= 1.12

1. **Upload the Datadog Cloud Foundry Buildpack.**
  Download the latest Datadog [build pack release][5] and upload it to your Cloud Foundry environment.

    ```shell
    cf create-buildpack datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack ./datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack-latest.zip
    ```

2. **Push your application with the Datadog buildpack and your buildpacks.**
  The process to push your application with multiple buildpack is described in the [cloud foundry documentation][27].
  This process is likely to change in the close future so please check the link above.

    ```shell
    cf push <YOUR_APP> --no-start -b binary_buildpack
    cf v3-push <YOUR_APP> -b datadog-cloudfoundry-buildpack -b YOUR-BUILDPACK-1 -b YOUR-FINAL-BUILDPACK
    ```

  **Important**: If you were using a single buildpack before, it should probably be the last one to be loaded in order for it to act as a final buildpack. To learn more refer to [cloud foundry documentation][27] about buildpacks.

#### Meta-Buildpack **(deprecated)**

If you are a [meta-buildpack][28] user, our buildpack can be used as a decorator out of the box.

**Note**: The [meta-buildpack][28] has been deprecated by pivotal in favor of the [multi-buildpack][25] and that we might drop the support for it in a future release.

### Configuration

#### Metric Collection

**Set an API Key in your environment to enable the buildpack**:

```shell
# set the environment variable
cf set-env <YOUR_APP> DD_API_KEY <DD_API_KEY>
# restage the application to get it to pick up the new environment variable and use the buildpack
cf restage <YOUR_APP>
```

#### Log Collection (closed beta)

To start collecting logs from your application in CloudFoundry, the Agent contained in the buildpack needs to be activated and log collection enabled.

```
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME RUN_AGENT true
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_LOGS_ENABLED true
# Disable the Agent core checks to disable system metrics collection
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_ENABLE_CHECKS false
# restage the application to get it to pick up the new environment variable and use the buildpack
cf restage $YOUR_APP_NAME
```

By default, the Agent collects logs from `stdout`/`stderr` and listens to TCP port 10514.
It is possible to ask the Agent to listen on a different TCP port if you are streaming logs from your application in TCP.
To disable log collection from `stdout`/`stderr`, use the following configuration:

```
# override the TCP port
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DD_LOGS_CONFIG_TCP_FORWARD_PORT 10514
# disable log collection on stdout/stderr
cf set-env $YOUR_APP_NAME DISABLE_STD_LOG_COLLECTION true
```

### Build

To build this buildpack, edit the relevant files and run the `./build` script. If you want to upload it, run `./upload`.

### DogStatsD

See [the DogStatsD documentation][6] for more information. We maintain [a list of DogStatsD libraries][7] compatible with a wide range of applications.

## Monitor Your Cloud Foundry Cluster

There are two points of integration with Datadog, each of which achieves a different goal:

* **Datadog Agent BOSH release** — Install the Datadog Agent on every node in your deployment to track system, network, and disk metrics. Enable any other Agent checks you wish.
* **Datadog Firehose Nozzle** — Deploy one or more Datadog Firehose Nozzle jobs. The jobs tap into your deployment's Loggregator Firehose and send all non-container metrics to Datadog.

These integrations are meant for Cloud Foundry deployment administrators, not end users.

### Prerequisites

You must have a working Cloud Foundry deployment and access to the BOSH Director that manages it. You also need BOSH CLI to deploy each integration. You may use either major version of the CLI—[v1][8] or [v2][9].

### Install the Datadog Agent BOSH Release

Datadog provides tarballs of the Datadog Agent packaged as a BOSH release. Upload the latest release to your BOSH Director and then install it on every node in your deployment as an [addon][11] (i.e. the same way a Director deploys the BOSH Agent to all nodes).

#### Upload Datadog's release to your BOSH Director

```
# BOSH CLI v1
bosh upload release https://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-agent/datadog-agent-boshrelease-latest.tgz

# BOSH CLI v2
bosh upload-release https://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-agent/datadog-agent-boshrelease-latest.tgz
```

If you'd like to create your own release, see the [Datadog Agent BOSH Release repository][12].

#### Configure the Agent as an addon in your BOSH Director

Add the following to your BOSH Director's runtime configuration file (e.g. `runtime.yml`):

```
---
releases:
  - name: datadog-agent
    version: <VERSION_YOU_UPLOADED> # specify the real version, i.e. x.y.z, not 'latest'

addons:
- name: datadog
  jobs:
  - name: dd-agent
    release: datadog-agent
  properties:
    dd:
      use_dogstatsd: yes
      dogstatsd_port: 18125               # Many CF deployments have a StatsD already on port 8125
      api_key: <DD_API_KEY>
      tags: ["cloudfoundry_deployment_1"] # any tags you wish
      generate_processes: true            # to enable the process check
```

To see which `datadog-agent` release version you uploaded earlier, run `bosh releases`.

If you don't have a local copy of the runtime configuration, create a `runtime.yml` with the current runtime configuration (`bosh runtime-config`) and add the above YAML to it. If the Director's runtime configuration is empty, create a new `runtime.yml` containing only the above YAML.

#### Enable extra Agent checks

For each extra Agent check you want to enable across your deployment, add its configuration under the `properties.dd.integrations` key, e.g.:

```
  properties:
    dd:
      integrations:
        directory:
          init_config: {}
          instances:
            directory: "."
        #process:
        #  init_config: {}
        #...
```

The configuration under each check name should look the same as if you were configuring the check in its own file in the Agent's conf.d directory.

You shouldn't configure a check for a subset of nodes in your deployment; everything you configure in `runtime.yml` applies to every node.

To customize configuration for the default checks—system, network, disk, and ntp—see the [full list of configuration options][13] for the Datadog Agent BOSH release.

#### Sync the runtime configuration to the Director

```
# BOSH CLI v1
bosh update runtime-config runtime.yml

# BOSH CLI v2
bosh update-runtime-config runtime.yml
```

#### Redeploy your Cloud Foundry deployment

```
# BOSH CLI v1
bosh deployment yourDeploymentManifest.yml
bosh -n deploy

# BOSH CLI v2
bosh -n -d yourDeployment deploy yourDeploymentManifest.yml
```

Since runtime configuration applies globally, BOSH will redeploy every node in your deployment. If you have more than one deployment, redeploy those, too, to install the Datadog Agent everywhere.

#### Verify the Agent is installed everywhere

The easiest way to check that Agent installs were successful is to filter for them in the [Host map page][14] in Datadog. The Agent BOSH release tags each host with a generic `cloudfoundry` tag, so filter by that, and optionally group hosts by any tag you wish (e.g. `bosh_job`), as in the following screenshot:

{{< img src="integrations/cloud_foundry/cloud-foundry-host-map.png" alt="cloud-foundry-host-map" responsive="true" >}}

Click on any host to zoom in, then click **system** within its hexagon to make sure Datadog is receiving metrics for it:

{{< img src="integrations/cloud_foundry/cloud-foundry-host-map-detail.png" alt="cloud-foundry-host-map-detail" responsive="true" >}}

### Deploy the Datadog Firehose Nozzle

As with the Datadog Agent, Datadog provides a BOSH release of the Datadog Firehose Nozzle. After uploading the release to your Director, add the Nozzle to an existing deployment, or create a new deployment that only includes the Nozzle. The instructions below assume you're adding it to an existing Cloud Foundry deployment that has a working Loggregator Firehose.

#### Upload Datadog's release to your BOSH Director

```
# BOSH CLI v1
bosh upload release http://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-firehose-nozzle/datadog-firehose-nozzle-release-latest.tgz

# BOSH CLI v2
bosh upload-release http://cloudfoundry.datadoghq.com/datadog-firehose-nozzle/datadog-firehose-nozzle-release-latest.tgz
```

If you'd like to create your own release, see the [Datadog Firehose Nozzle release repository][15].

#### Configure a UAA client

In the manifest that contains your UAA configuration, add a new client for the Datadog Nozzle so the job(s) can access the Firehose:

```
uaa:
  clients:
    datadog-firehose-nozzle:
      access-token-validity: 1209600
      authorities: doppler.firehose
      authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
      override: true
      scope: doppler.firehose
      secret: <MAKE_IT_A_GOOD_ONE>
```

And redeploy the deployment to add the user.

#### Add Nozzle jobs

Configure one or more Nozzle jobs in your main Cloud Foundry deployment manifest (e.g. cf-manifest.yml):

```
jobs:
#- instances: 4
#  name: some_other_job
#  ...
- instances: 1            # add more instances if one job cannot keep up with the Firehose
  name: datadog_nozzle_z1
  networks:
    - name: cf1           # some network you've configured elsewhere in the manifest
  resource_pool: small_z1 # some resource_pool you've configured elsewhere in the manifest
  templates:
    - name: datadog-firehose-nozzle
      release: datadog-firehose-nozzle
  properties:
    datadog:
      api_key: <YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY>
      api_url: https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/series
      flush_duration_seconds: 15 # seconds between flushes to Datadog. Default is 15.
    loggregator:
      # do NOT append '/firehose' or even a trailing slash to the URL; 'ws://<host>:<port>' will do
      traffic_controller_url: <LOGGREGATOR_URL> # e.g. ws://traffic-controller.your-cf-domain.com:8081
    nozzle:
      deployment: <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>    # tags each firehose metric with 'deployment:<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>'
      subscription_id: datadog-nozzle  # can be anything (firehose streams data evenly to all jobs using the same subscription_id)
      # disable_access_control: true   # for development only
      # insecure_ssl_skip_verify: true # for development only; enable if your UAA does not use a verifiable cert
    uaa:
      client: datadog-firehose-nozzle # client name you just configured
      client_secret: <SECRET_YOU_JUST_CONFIGURED>
      url: <UAA_URL> # e.g. https://uaa.your-cf-domain.com:8443
```

To see all available configuration options, check the [Datadog Firehose Nozzle repository][16].

In the same manifest, add the Datadog Nozzle release name and version:

```
releases:
# - name: some-other-release
#   version: x.y.z
# ...
  - name: datadog-firehose-nozzle
    version: <VERSION_YOU_UPLOADED> # specify the real version, i.e. x.y.z, not 'latest'
```

To see which `datadog-firehose-nozzle` release version you uploaded earlier, run `bosh releases`.

#### Redeploy the deployment

```
# BOSH CLI v1
bosh deployment cf-manifest.yml
bosh -n deploy

# BOSH CLI v2
bosh -n -d cf-manifest deploy cf-manifest.yml
```

#### Verify the Nozzle is collecting

On the [Metrics explorer][17] page in Datadog, search for metrics beginning `cloudfoundry.nozzle`:

{{< img src="integrations/cloud_foundry/cloud-foundry-nozzle-metrics.png" alt="cloud-foundry-nozzle-metrics" responsive="true" >}}

## Data Collected

### Metrics

The following metrics are sent by the Datadog Firehose Nozzle (`cloudfoundry.nozzle`). The Datadog Agent release does not send any special metrics of its own, just the usual metrics from any Agent checks you configure in the Director runtime config (and, by default, [system][29], [network][20], [disk][21], and [ntp][22] metrics).

The Datadog Firehose Nozzle only collects CounterEvents (as metrics, not events) and ValueMetrics; it ignores LogMessages, Errors, and ContainerMetrics.
