# Overview

Amazon Billing allows you to track your AWS infrastructure billing forecasts and costs.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your Billing metrics.

# Installation

In order to see AWS Budget metrics, the requirement for this integration is the permission `budgets:ViewBudget`.

You must also enable billing metrics within the [AWS Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html#turning_on_billing_metrics).

Note: AWS Budget metrics can only be collected from the AWS master account.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git() %>

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
