# Overview

![S3 Dashboard](/static/images/s3_db_screenshot.png)

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a highly available and scalable cloud storage service.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your S3 metrics.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws).

* **Daily Storage Metrics**

	The only requirement to monitor daily metrics is the permission `s3:GetBucketTagging`.

* **Request Metrics**

	[Enable Requests metrics][1] on your Amazon S3 buckets from the AWS console.

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that S3 is checked under metric collection.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git() %>

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
