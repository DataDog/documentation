Zendesk is a customer service and support ticket platform that allows you to receive, track and respond to inquiries and requests from customers. Enable this integration to see ticket metrics in Datadog and to create and update tickets from Datadog.

Integrate with Zendesk to:

* Monitor and graph ticket count metrics by status, user, and satisfaction rating
* Receive a Datadog event each time a new Zendesk ticket is opened
* Create and update tickets using @zendesk mentions
