# Overview

![Fastly Graph](/static/images/fastlygraph.png)

Connect to Fastly to see key Fastly metrics (like cache coverage and header size) in context with the rest of your Datadog metrics.

# Installation

No installation steps required.

# Configuration

Create a Read-only access API Token on Fastly's token management page, get your Service ID from the Dashboard and enter them in the [Fastly integration tile](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/fastly).

Note: The ServiceID is the alphanumerical code, e.g. 5VqE6MOOy1QFJbgmCK41pY (example from https://docs.fastly.com/api/auth).

If using multiple Service IDs from one account, please enter an API token on each line.
