# Overview

Connect Jenkins to Datadog in order to discuss build failures with your team.

The integration in the Datadog agent for Jenkins has been deprecated in favor of the open-source Jenkins plugin. For more details about setting up the plugin, [refer to it's page on GitHub](https://github.com/DataDog/jenkins-datadog-plugin).
