## Overview

This Jenkins plugin sends your build and deployment events to Datadog. From there, you can overlay them onto graphs of your other metrics so you can identify which deployments really affect your application's performance and reliabilityâ€”for better or worse.

The plugin also tracks build times (as a metric) and statuses (as a service check), so you'll know when your builds aren't healthy.

**Note: The Jenkins check for the Datadog Agent is deprecated.** Use the [Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/DataDog/jenkins-datadog-plugin).

## Installation

_This plugin requires [Jenkins 1.580.1](http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war/1.580.1/jenkins.war) or newer._

[This plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/datadog-plugin) can be installed from the [Update Center](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins#Plugins-Howtoinstallplugins) (found at **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Plugins**) in your Jenkins installation.

1. Navigate to the web interface of your Jenkins installation.

2. From the [Update Center](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins#Plugins-Howtoinstallplugins) (found at Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins), under the Available tab, search for **Datadog Plugin**.

3. Check the checkbox next to the plugin, and install using one of the two install buttons at the bottom of the screen.

4. To configure the plugin, navigate to the **Manage Jenkins** -> **Configure System** page, and find the *Datadog Plugin* section.

5. Copy/Paste your API Key from the [API Keys](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api) page on your Datadog account, into the `API Key` textbox on the configuration screen.

6. Before saving your configuration, test your API connection using the *Test Key* button, directly below the `API Key` textbox.

7. Optional: Set a custom Hostname
You can set a custom hostname for your Jenkins host via the Hostname textbox on the same configuration screen. Note: Hostname must follow the [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123#section-2) format.
