# Overview

![ELB default dashboard](/static/images/elb.png)

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is an AWS service used to dispatch incoming web traffic from your applications across your Amazon EC2 backend instances, which may be in different availability zones. ELB helps ensure a smooth user experience and provide increased fault tolerance, handling traffic peaks and failed EC2 instances without interruption.

To start collecting ELB metrics, the only thing you need to do is to set up our integration with AWS CloudWatch by following [these instructions](http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/aws/).

Learn more about how to monitor ELB performance metrics thanks to [our series of posts](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/top-elb-health-and-performance-metrics/). We detail the key performance metrics, how to collect them, and how to use Datadog to monitor ELB.

# Configuration

1.  Enable the [Amazon Web Services integration](/integrations/aws).
1.  Open the [AWS integration tile](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/amazon_web_services) and ensure the **ELB checkbox** on the left is checked.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git()%>

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
