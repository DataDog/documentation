# Overview
The Python integration enables you to monitor any custom metric by instrumenting a few lines of code. For instance, you can have a metric that returns the number of page views or the time of any function call. For additional information about the Python integration, please refer to the guide on submitting metrics. For advanced usage, please refer to the documentation in the repository. You can also review [the API docs](/api) for details on how to use the API with Python.

# Installation

1.  To install from pip:

        pip install datadog

2.  Start instrumenting your code:

        # Configure the module according to your needs
        from datadog import initialize

        options = {
            'api_key':'api_key',
            'app_key':'app_key'
        }

        initialize(**options)

        # Use Datadog REST API client
        from datadog import api

        title = "Something big happened!"
        text = 'And let me tell you all about it here!'
        tags = ['version:1', 'application:web']

        api.Event.create(title=title, text=text, tags=tags)


        # Use Statsd, a Python client for DogStatsd
        from datadog import statsd

        statsd.increment('whatever')
        statsd.gauge('foo', 42)

        # Or ThreadStats, an alternative tool to collect and flush metrics,using Datadog REST API
        from datadog import ThreadStats
        stats = ThreadStats()
        stats.start()
        stats.increment('home.page.hits')

# Configuration

There is nothing that you need to do in the Datadog application to configure Python.

# Validation

Go to the [Metrics explorer page](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/explorer) and see that it just works!
