## Overview

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your SES metrics.

## Setup
### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). The only requirement for this integration is the permission `ses:get`.

### Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that SES is checked under metric collection.

## Data Collected
### Metrics

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
