# Overview

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a cost-effective, outbound-only email-sending service.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your SES metrics.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). The only requirement for this integration is the permission `ses:get`.

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that SES is checked under metric collection.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git()%>

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
