# Overview

Connect MySQL to Datadog in order to:

  * Visualize your database performance
  * Correlate the performance of MySQL with the rest of your applications

# Installation

1.  Create a ```datadog``` user with replication rights on your MySQL server with the following command, replacing ```<UNIQUEPASSWORD>``` with a unique password:

        sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'datadog'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<UNIQUEPASSWORD>';"
        sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"

    If you'd like to get the full metrics catalog please also grant the following privileges:

        sudo mysql -e "GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';"
        sudo mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';"

2.  Verify that the user was created successfully using the following command, replacing ```<UNIQUEPASSWORD>``` with the password above:

        mysql -u datadog --password=<UNIQUEPASSWORD> -e "show status" | \
        grep Uptime && echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL user - OK\033[0m" || \
        echo -e "\033[0;31mCannot connect to MySQL\033[0m"
        mysql -u datadog --password=<UNIQUEPASSWORD> -e "show slave status" && \
        echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL grant - OK\033[0m" || \
        echo -e "\033[0;31mMissing REPLICATION CLIENT grant\033[0m"

# Configuration

1. Edit the mysql.yaml file in your agent's conf.d directory, replacing ```<UNIQUEPASSWORD>``` with the password used above.

       init_config:

       instances:
         - server: localhost
           user: datadog
           pass: <UNIQUEPASSWORD>

           tags:
               - optional_tag1
               - optional_tag2
           options:
               replication: 0
               galera_cluster: 1

# Validation

To validate your installation and configuration, restart the agent and execute the info command. The output should contain a section similar to the following:
