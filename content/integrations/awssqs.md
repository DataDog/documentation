# Overview

![SQS Dashboard](/static/images/sqsdashboard.png)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service.

Enable this integration to see all your SQS metrics in Datadog.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). There are no other installation steps that need to be performed.

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that SQS is checked under metric collection.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git()%>

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
