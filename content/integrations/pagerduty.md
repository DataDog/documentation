## Overview

Connect PagerDuty to Datadog in order to:

  * Trigger and resolve incidents from your stream by mentioning @pagerduty in your post
  * See incidents and escalations in your stream as they occur
  * Get a daily reminder of who's on-call

You can also check out [this documentation][1] from Pagerduty.

Once you have Pagerduty integrated, you can check out our custom [Pagerduty Incident Trends][2].

## Troubleshooting
### How do I automatically resolve a PagerDuty service when a monitor recovers?

You must include the PagerDuty notification in the `{{is_resolve}}` context of your **Say what's happening** section of your monitor as follows:
```
{{#is_resolve}} 

    This notification will only occur if the monitor resolves. 
    If  @pagerduty-trigger was triggered for the alert, it'll be resolved as well 

{{/is_resolve}}
```

### How do I send a message/notification to a specific Pager Duty service when multiple are integrated ?

Use "@pagerduty-[serviceName]" in your monitor message. If you start typing it in your monitor **Say what's happening** section, you should see it autocomplete.
