## Overview

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your Polly metrics.

## Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). There are no other installation steps that need to be performed.

## Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that Polly is checked under metric collection.

## Metrics



Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
