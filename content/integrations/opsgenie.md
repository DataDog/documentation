## How to Use Datadog and OpsGenie Together

### Create, acknowledge and close OpsGenie alerts from Datadog

Create an OpsGenie alert by putting @opsgenie-service_name or @opsgenie in the *Say Whatâ€™s Happening* field, section 5, in the Edit Metric Alert. When this alert is triggered in Datadog, an alert will be sent to the recipients in your OpsGenie service.

### Receive, acknowledge and close Datadog alerts created by OpsGenie

Set-up alerts in OpsGenie. When that alert is triggered, an event will be created in Datadog. The tags and description field from the OpsGenie alert will be carried over to Datadog.
