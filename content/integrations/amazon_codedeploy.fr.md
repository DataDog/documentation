## Overview

AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployment to instances in the cloud and on-premise.

Enable this integration to see AWS CodeDeploy deployment events and metrics in Datadog.

## Setup
### Installation

1. If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/).

### Configuration 

1. Add those permissions to your [Datadog IAM policy](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/#installation) in order to collect Amazon CodeDeploy metrics: 

    * `codedeploy:ListApplications` : Used to list all CodeDeploy applications
    * `codedeploy:ListDeploymentGroups`: Used to list all deployment groups within an application (edited)
    * `codedeploy:ListDeployments`: Used to list deployments in a deployment group within an application (edited)
    * `codedeploy:BatchGetDeployments` : Gets detailed descriptions of deployments (edited)
    * `codedeploy:BatchGetDeploymentGroups`: Gets detailed descriptions of deployment groups

    For more information on CodeDeploy policies, review [the documentation on the AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_codedeploy.html).

2. Install the [Datadog - AWS CodeDeploy integration](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/amazon_codedeploy).

## Data Collected
### Metrics

* Successful deployments
* Failed deployments
* Stopped deployments

### Service Checks
The AWS Codedeploy integration does not include any service check at this time.
