### Overview

Capture etcd metrics in Datadog to:

* Monitor the health of your etcd cluster.
* Know when host configurations may be out of sync.
* Correlate the performance of etcd with the rest of your applications.

Furthermore, etcd metrics are tagged with `etcd_state:leader` or `etcd_state:follower`, depending on the node status, so you can easily aggregate metrics by status.
