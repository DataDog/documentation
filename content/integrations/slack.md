## Overview

Connect Slack to Datadog in order to help your team collaborate by:

* Sharing graphs with your colleagues in your team's channels.
* Receiving alerts and notifications from Datadog within Slack.


## Installation

The Slack integration is installed via its [integration tile](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/slack) in the Datadog application.

## Configuration
1. In your Slack account go to the [Applications page](https://slack.com/apps) and search for Datadog.
2. Click Install, followed by Add Integration.
3. Copy the Slack Service Hook and paste in the [service hook field for Slack in Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/slack).
4.  Add the channels you want to be able to post to.
5. If you would like to be notified for every comment on a graph, tick the check box "Transfer all user comments" by each channel. If left unchecked (default) you will need to use the @slack-channel_name syntax for comments to be posted to slack.

If you wish to integrate with multiple Slack accounts, repeat the above steps and populate the Secondary Slack Account fields.
