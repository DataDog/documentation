<div> <h3 id="subtitle">Java, Cassandra, Tomcat, ActiveMQ, Solr</h3> <h2
id="introduction">Introduction</h2> JMX Checks are agents checks that collect
metrics from applications that expose them using <a
href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html'>
JMX</a>.

In order to collect these metrics, a lightweight Java plugin named JMXFetch is
called by the Datadog Agent to connect to the MBean Server and to collect these
metrics. This plugin sends metrics to the Datadog Agent using the Dogstatsd
server running with the Agent.

JMX Checks have a limit of 350 metrics per instance which should be enough to
satisfy your needs as it's really easy to customize which metrics you want to
collect.  We are going to see how to do so.

<h3>Enabling JMX checks</h3>
<p>The instructions to set up these integrations from within the Datadog Agent can be found here:</p>
<ul><li><a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/activemq' target='_blank'>Active MQ</a></li>
<li><a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/cassandra' target='_blank'>Cassandra</a></li>
<li><a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/java' target='_blank'>Java</a></li>
<li><a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/solr' target='_blank'>Solr</a></li>
<li><a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/tomcat' target='_blank'>Tomcat</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2> JMX Checks have a default configuration that will collect 13 metrics from your 
JMX application. A few of these metrics are: jvm.heap_memory, jvm.non_heap_memory, jvm.gc.cms.count...
So seeing these metrics is a sign that JMXFetch is properly running.
They also allow you to specify a configuration in the yaml file that will be read by JMXFetch to filter which
metrics it should send back to the Agent.
<br>
<h4>Commands to view the metrics that are available:</h4>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    The <code>datadog-agent jmx</code> command ws added in version 4.1.0.
</div>

<ul>
<li>
List attributes that match at least one of your instances configuration: <br><code>sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_matching_attributes</code>
</li>
<li>
List attributes that do match one of your instances configuration but that are not
being collected because it would exceed the number of metrics that can be
collected:<br> <code>sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_limited_attributes</code>
</li>
<li>
List attributes that will actually be collected by your current instances configuration:<br> <code>sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_collected_attributes</code>
</li>
<li>
List attributes that don't match any of your instances configuration:<br> <code>sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_not_matching_attributes</code>
</li>
<li>List every attributes available that has a type supported by JMXFetch:<br> <code>sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_everything</code> </li>
<li>
Start the collection of metrics based on your current configuration and display them in the console:<br> <code>sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx collect</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to customize what metrics to collect:</h4>
Like every other Agent Check, JMX Checks have 2 main sections:
<ul>
<li><code>init_config</code>: Settings that will be applied to every instances</li>
<li><code>instances</code>: Settings used to configure instances</li>
</ul> See <a href='http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/agent_checks/#config'>this page for more information</a>.<br><br>

JMX checks require a <code>conf</code> section that has to be placed within either the <code>init_config</code> section or the <code>instances</code> section.<br><br>

The <code>conf</code> section will be used to determine what JMX attributes should be collected and sent as metrics to Datadog.

<br /><br /> The configuration section looks like this: <%=snippet_code_block "jmx-basic-conf.yaml" %>

The <code>conf</code> parameter is a list of dictionaries. Only 2 keys are
allowed in this dictionary: <br /> <ul> <li><code>include</code>
(<b>mandatory</b>): Dictionary of filters, any attribute that matches these
filters will be collected unless it also matches the "exclude" filters (see
below)</li> <li><code>exclude</code> (<b>optional</b>): Another dictionary of
filters. Attributes that match these filters won't be collected</li> </ul>

<p>
For a given bean, metrics get tagged in the following manner:
<pre><code>mydomain:attr0=val0,attr1=val1</code></pre>

Your metric will be mydomain (or some variation depending on the attribute
inside the bean) and have the tags <code>attr0:val0, attr1:val1, domain:mydomain</code>.
</p>


<h3>Description of the filters</h3> These dictionaries have some specials keys:
<br><ul> <li><code>domain</code>: The domain of the attribute (e.g.
java.lang)</li> <li><code>bean</code> or <code>bean_name</code>: A <a href="#update-note">list</a> of full bean
names (e.g. java.lang:type=Compilation)</li> <li><code>attribute</code>: A <a href="#update-note">list</a>
or a dictionary of attribute names (see below for more details)</li> </ul> On
top of these parameters, the filters support "custom" keys which means that you
can filter by bean parameters.

	Example: Let's say you want to collect metrics regarding the Cassandra
cache. You could use the <code>type:</code> <code>  - Caches</code> filter: <br /> <br /> <%=snippet_code_block "jmx-cassandra-cache.yaml" %>

<h4>The <code>attribute</code> filter</h4>

<ul>The <code>attribute</code> filter can accept two types of values: <br /><br />
<li>A dictionary whose keys are attributes names:</li> <%=snippet_code_block "jmx-attribute-dict.yaml" %> </ul> In that case you can
specify an alias for the metric that will become the metric name in Datadog.
You can also specify the metric type either a gauge or a counter. If you choose
counter, a rate per second will be computed for this metric.

<br><br><li>A list of attributes names:</li><%= snippet_code_block "jmx-attribute-list.yaml" %>
In that case:<ul>
    <li>The metric type will be a gauge</li>
    <li>The metric name will be jmx.[DOMAIN_NAME].[ATTRIBUTE_NAME]</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is another filtering example:

<pre><code>instances:
  - host: 127.0.0.1
    name: jmx_instance
    port: 9999

init_config:
  conf:
    - include:
        bean: org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=ClientRequest,scope=Write,name=Latency
        attribute:
          - OneMinuteRate
          - 75thPercentile
          - 95thPercentile
          - 99thPercentile
</code></pre>


</p>

</div>
<h4 id="update-note">Note</h4>
List of filters is only supported in Datadog Agent > 5.3.0. If you are using an older version, please use singletons and multiple `include` statements instead.
<pre><code># Datadog Agent > 5.3.0
conf:
    - include:
       domain: domain_name
       bean:
         - first_bean_name
         - second_bean_name
...
</code></pre>
<pre><code># Older Datadog Agent versions
conf:
    - include:
        domain: domain_name
        bean: first_bean_name
    - include:
        domain: domain_name
        bean: second_bean_name
...
</code></pre>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h4>The 350 metric limit</h4> Due to the nature of
these integrations, it is possible to submit an extremely high number of
metrics directly to Datadog. What we've found in speaking with many customers
is that some of these metrics are not needed; thus, we've set the limit at 350
and below you'll find the tools to both see what you're collecting and to get
below the limit.
<p>Begin by using the commands seen <a href='#customization'>above</a> to investigate what metrics are available.
Once you have seen all metrics that are available, we recommend creating filters to refine what metrics are collected.
If you believe you need more than 350 metrics, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@datadoghq.com">support@datadoghq.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Java Path</h4> The agent does not come with a bundled JVM, but will use the one installed on your system. Therefore you must make sure that the Java home directory is present in the path of the user running the agent. 
<br>Alternatively, you can specify the JVM path in the integration's configuration file:

<pre><code>java_bin_path: /path/to/java
</code></pre>
