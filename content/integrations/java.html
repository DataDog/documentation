<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
JMX Checks are agents checks that collect metrics from applications that expose them using <a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/javamanagement-140525.html'> JMX </a>

In order to collect these metrics, a lightweight Java plugin named JMXFetch is called by the Datadog Agent to connect to the MBean Server and to collect these metrics. This plugin sends metrics to the Datadog Agent using the dogstatsd server running with the agent.

JMX Checks have a limit of 100 metrics per instance which should be enough to satisfy your needs as it's really easy to customize which metrics you want to collect.
We are going to see how to do so.

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
JMX Checks allow you to specify a configuration in the yaml file that will be read by JMXFetch to filter which metrics it should send back to the agent.

<br /><br />
The configuration sections is looking like this:
<%= snippet_code_block "jmx-basic-conf.yaml" %>

The <code>conf</code> parameter is a list of dictionaries. Only 2 keys are allowed in this dictionary:
<br />
<ul>
	<li><code>include</code> (<b>mandatory</b>): Dictionary of filters, any attribute that matches these filters will be collected unless it also matches the "exclude" filters (see below)</li>
	<li><code>exclude</code> (<b>optional</b>): Another dictionary of filters. Attributes that match these filters won't be collected</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description of the filters</h3>
These dictionaries have some specials keys: 
<br><ul>
		<li><code>domain</code>: The domain of the attribute (e.g. java.lang)</li>
		<li><code>bean</code> or <code>bean_name</code>: The full bean name (e.g. java.lang:type=Compilation)</li>
		<li><code>attribute</code>: A list or a dictionary of attribute names (see below for more details)</li>
	</ul>
	On top of these parameters, the filters support "custom" keys which means that you can filter by bean parameters. 

	Example: Let's say you want to collect metrics regarding the Cassandra cache. You could use the <code>type: Caches</code> filter:
	 <br /> <br />
	<%= snippet_code_block "jmx-cassandra-cache.yaml" %> 

<h4>The <code>attribute</code> filter</h4>

The <code>attribute</code> filter can accept two types of values:
<br /><br />
<ul>
	<li>A list of attributes names:</li> 
<%= snippet_code_block "jmx-attribute-list.yaml" %> 

<br /><br />
	<li>A dictionary whose keys are attributes names:</li>
<%= snippet_code_block "jmx-attribute-dict.yaml" %> 
</ul>
	In that case you can specify an alias for the metric that will become the metric name in Datadog. You can also specify the metric type either a gauge or a counter. If you choose counter, a rate per second will be computed for this metric.
