<h3>Overview</h3>

Capture Bitbucket commits and Pull Request events in Datadog to:
<ul>
<li> Track new features from code changes</li>
<li> Identify when new code changes lead to system alerts or build failures</li>
<li> Discuss code changes with your team in the Datadog Event Stream</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="int-configuration">

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Select 'Bitbucket' <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings">here</a> and link your account.
You can then select which repos you would like to integrate, and if you'd like to
receive commits and/or pull requests.

</div>

<h3>What to Expect</h3>
Once the integration is complete, whatever you select (commits and/or pull requests) will populate
into your Datadog Event Stream.
<ul>
    <li>When commits are made</li>
    <li>When a PR is created</li>
    <li>When a comment is made/deleted on a PR</li>
</ul>

If you view a dashboard, in the top left search bar you can type <code>sources:bitbucket</code> to see bitbucket
events overlayed over your the graphs on that dashboard.

<h3>Limitations</h3>
Bitbucket knows an issue (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/8340/pull-request-post-hook-does-not-include">#8340</a>) with some data they send via their PR POST hook:<br/>
Other Pull Request events can't be used for now
<ul>
    <li>Update</li>
    <li>Decline</li>
    <li>Approve/Unapprove</li>
    <li>Merge</li>
    <li>Close</li>
    <li>Comment update</li>
</ul>
