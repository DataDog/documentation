<h3>Overview</h3>
Track all Pingdom downtime events and user-centric performance metrics in Datadog, 
for correlation with other relevant events and metrics

<h3>Questions and Troubleshooting</h3>
<span class="question">Q: How do I get uptime?</span>
<br> A: Pulling uptime from Pingdom, their API requires passing an interval for each query. 
For a given point in time, the value of uptime depends on how large the interval 
is so we can't record a unique value per check per point in time.

<span class="question">Q: Does Datadog support transaction checks?</span>
<br>A: Pingdom does not provide an API for transaction checks, 
so weâ€™re not able to show them in Datadog. The transaction monitor 
feature was in beta until recently, so if it becomes available we will look to support it.
