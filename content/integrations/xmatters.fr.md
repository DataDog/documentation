## Overview

xMatters IT Alerting integrates people into your toolchains spanning across teams and silos. xMatters automates communications so you can proactively prevent outages, rapidly engage resolvers, manage major incidents, and keep stakeholders informed.

Connect Datadog to xMatters to:

* Trigger xMatters notifications with responses integrated into all your IT tools

* Notify resolvers based on escalation rules, on-call schedules, skills, and location

* Look up the current xMatters on-call schedule from within Datadog

* Configure response options that trigger other xMatters integrations and drive workflow for tasks such as creating tickets, updating consoles, sending additional notifications, and initiating chat & conference-call collaboration

* Add additional reporting and analytics to your operational processes

## Setup
