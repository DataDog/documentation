<h3>Overview</h3>

Capture Nagios activity in Datadog to:
<ul>
<li> Identify trends in service failures at a glance.</li>
<li> Recall issue resolutions with a single click.</li>
<li> Discuss service failures with your team.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Set up information collection for Nagios by editing the given YAML configuration file <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/5.1.1/conf.d/nagios.yaml.example">nagios.yaml.example</a> and renaming it as nagios.yaml

After having Nagios reporting to Datadog for a week, an interactive report on alerting checks can be found
<a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/report/nagios">here</a>.

To integrate with Icinga, because it is a fork of Nagios, you should be able to use the Nagios integration to pull in Icinga events. Just link to the Icinga configuration instead of the Nagios one.
