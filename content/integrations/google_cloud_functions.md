# Overview

Get metrics from Google Functions to:

* Visualize the performance of your Functions
* Correlate the performance of your Functions with your applications

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Google Cloud Platform integration first](/integrations/google_cloud_platform). There are no other installation steps that need to be performed.
