title: Can I install the agent on my Kubernetes master node(s)
kind: faq

Yes!

Since Kubernetes 1.6, the concept of [Taints and Tolerances](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/03/advanced-scheduling-in-kubernetes.html) was introduced. Now rather than the master being off limits, it's tainted. If you add the required tolerance to the pod, it runs. 

Add the following to your Deployment (or Daemonset if you are running a multi-master setup):
```
spec:
 tolerations: 
 - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
   effect: NoSchedule
```
