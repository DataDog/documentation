[The Datadog Agent](/agent) assumes that the kubelet API is available at the default gateway of the container. If that's not the case because you are using a software defined network like Calico or Flannel, override the kubelet host with the KUBERNETES_KUBELET_HOST environment variable.

```
          - name: KUBERNETES_KUBELET_HOST
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: spec.nodeName
```
