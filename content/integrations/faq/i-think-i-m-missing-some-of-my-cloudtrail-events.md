Assuming you've configured the [CloudTrail integration](/integrations/amazon_cloudtrail) appropriately and are at least seeing some of your events, then what you're experiencing is likely by design.

We filter and aggregate events to show what’s most important and to reduce noise, in [our doc](/integrations/amazon_web_services/#cloudtrail) you can see the list of the events we currently post and if you’d like to add additional events just let us know and we'll add them to your account.
