title: How can I gather metrics from the UNIX shell?
kind: faq
---

To gather metrics from the UNIX command line, we can use the unannounced shell integration.

This integration has not yet been merged into the master branch, install this check as a custom Agent check in the appropriate Datadog Agent [directories][1].

You can find the integration files on GitHub:

* [Shell YAML Example][2]
* [Shell checks.d][3]

This solution is a good alternative to creating a custom Agent check for data you can easily gather directly from the UNIX shell. For example, sending a metric with a value of the number of files in a certain directory.

Caveat: 

The user that the Agent runs as may need sudo access for the shell command. Sudo access is not required when running the Agent as root (not recommended).
