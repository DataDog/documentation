title: Troubleshooting JMX Integrations

To verify you have access to JMX, test using JConsole or equivalent if possible. If you're unable to connect using JConsole [this article][1] may help to get you sorted. Also, if the metrics listed in your YAML aren't 1:1 with those listed in JConsole you'll need to correct this.

If you're able to connect using JConsole, run the following:

```
java -jar /opt/datadog-agent/agent/checks/libs/jmxterm-1.0-DATADOG-uber.jar -l localhost:PORT -u USER -p PASSWORD
```

If you're able to connect using the command above, run: `beans` and send us a copy of the results from above along with the following information:

For Agent v6:

* Content of `/var/log/datadog/agent.log`
* Output of the [info command][3]
* Output of: `ps aux | grep jmxfetch`
* A copy of the YAML integration (send the file)

For Agent v5:

* [Agent logs][2]
* Output of the [info command][3]
* Output of: `ps aux | grep jmxfetch`
* Content of `/var/log/datadog/jmxfetch.log`
* Output of: `sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent jmx list_everything`
* A copy of the YAML integration (send the file)

**Note**: if you're able to see some metrics (`jvm.heap_memory`, `jvm.non_heap_memory`, etc.) it is a sign that JMXFetch is properly running. If you're targeting another application and not seeing related metrics, the likely issue is a misconfiguration in your YAML.

## Agent v6 troubleshooting

### Agent versions >=6.2

These commands are available since v6.2.0:

| Command                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------------              | :---                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list matching`     | List attributes that match at least one of your instances configuration.                                                                                                |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list limited`      | List attributes that do match one of your instances configuration but that are not being collected because it would exceed the number of metrics that can be collected. |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list collected`    | List attributes that are actually collected by your current instances configuration.                                                                                    |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list not-matching` | List attributes that donâ€™t match any of your instances configuration.                                                                                                   |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx list everything`   | List every attributes available that has a type supported by JMXFetch.                                                                                                  |
| `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent jmx collect`           | Start the collection of metrics based on your current configuration and display them in the console.                                                                    |

By default theses commands run on all the configured jmx checks. If you want to use them for specific checks, specify them using the `--checks` flag :

`sudo datadog-agent jmx list collected --checks tomcat`

### Agent versions [6.0;6.2[

The Agent 6 ships JMXFetch and supports all of its features, except those listed below. For agents version bellow v6.2 the `jmxterm` JAR is not shipped. If you wish to download and use `jmxterm`, please refer to the [upstream project][4].

The agent doesn't have a full featured interface to JMXFetch, so you may have to run some commands manually to debug the list of beans collected, JVMs, etc. A typical manual call will take the following form:

```shell
/usr/bin/java -Xmx200m -Xms50m -classpath /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/lib/tools.jar:/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch-0.18.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.datadog.jmxfetch.App --check <CHECK_LIST> --conf_directory /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d --log_level INFO --log_location /var/log/datadog/jmxfetch.log --reporter console <COMMAND>
```

where `<COMMAND>` is any of:

- `list_everything`
- `list_collected_attributes`
- `list_matching_attributes`
- `list_not_matching_attributes`
- `list_limited_attributes`
- `list_jvms`

and `<CHECK_LIST>` corresponds to a list of valid `yaml` configurations in
`/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/`. For instance:

- `cassandra.d/conf.yaml`
- `kafka.d/conf.yaml`
- `jmx.d/conf.yaml`

Example:

```
/usr/bin/java -Xmx200m -Xms50m -classpath /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/lib/tools.jar:/opt/datadog-agent/bin/agent/dist/jmx/jmxfetch-0.18.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.datadog.jmxfetch.App --check cassandra.d/conf.yaml jmx.d/conf.yaml --conf_directory /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d --log_level INFO --log_location /var/log/datadog/jmxfetch.log --reporter console list_everything
```

Note: the location to the JRE tools.jar (`/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/lib/tools.jar` in the example) might reside elsewhere in your system. You should be able to easily find it with `sudo find / -type f -name 'tools.jar'`.

**Note**: you may wish to specify alternative JVM heap parameters `-Xmx`, `-Xms`, the values used in the example correspond to the JMXFetch defaults.
