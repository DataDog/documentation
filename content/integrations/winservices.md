![Windows Service Event](/static/images/windows-service.png)

# Configuration

Configure the Agent using the Agent Manager

1.  Edit the "Windows Service" configuration in the Agent Manager.

        init_config:

        instances:
          # For each instance you define what host to connect to (defaulting to the
          # current host) as well as a list of services you care about. The service
          # names should match the Service name in the properties and NOT the display
          # name in the services.msc list.
          #
          # If you want to check services on a remote host, you have to specify a
          # hostname and (optional) credentials
          #
          #-  host: MYREMOTESERVER
          #   username: MYREMOTESERVER\fred
          #   password: mysecretpassword
          #   tags:
          #     - fredserver
          #
          # The sample configuration will monitor the WMI Performance Adapter service,
          # named "wmiApSrv" in the service properties.
          #
          - host: . # "." means the current host
            services:
              - wmiApSrv # service names are not case-sensitive
    {:.language-yaml}

1.  Restart the agent.

# Validation

After you restart the agent, check the info page in the Agent Manager and verify that the integration check has passed. It should display a section similar to the following:
