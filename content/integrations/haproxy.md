# Overview

![HAProxy default dashboard](/static/images/haproxydash.png)

Capture HAProxy activity in Datadog to:

* Visualize HAProxy load-balancing performance.
* Know when a server goes down.
* Correlate the performance of HAProxy with the rest of your applications.

# Installation

Make sure that stats are enabled on your HAProxy configuration. See [this post for guidance on doing this](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/how-to-collect-haproxy-metrics/).

# Configuration

1.  Configure the Agent to connect to HAProxy. Edit conf.d/haproxy.yaml:

        init_config:

        instances:
            -   username: username
                password: password
                url: https://localhost/admin?stats

1.  Restart the Agent

# Validation

1.  Execute the info command and verify that the integration check has passed. The output of the command should contain a section similar to the following:

        Checks
        ======

        [...]

        haproxy
        -------
            - instance #0 [OK]
