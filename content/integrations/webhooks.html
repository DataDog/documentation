<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>To create a webhook, just enter the URL and a name. Then to use your
webhook in Datadog, just add @webhook-name_of_the_webhook in the
text of the metric alert you want to trigger the webhook. It will
trigger a POST request to the URL you set with the following content in JSON format.</p>

<p>You can also specify your own payload in order to add your own fields to the request.
Check the "Use Custom Payload" checkbox and specify your own custom payload, using the
following variables.
If you want your payload to be url-encoded, check the "Encode as form" payload and
specify your payload in a json format.</p>
