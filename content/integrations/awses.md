# Overview

Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch in the AWS Cloud.

Enable this integration to see custom tags and metrics for your ES clusters in Datadog.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). This integration requires the permissions `es:ListTags`, `es:ListDomainNames`  and `es:DescribeElasticsearchDomains` to be fully enabled.

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that ES is checked under metric collection.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git()%>

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
