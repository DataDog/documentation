# Overview

Amazon Lambda is a compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources required by that code.

Enable this integration to begin collecting Cloudwatch & custom metrics from your Lambda functions.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws).

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that Lambda is checked under metric collection.

To send custom metrics to Datadog, you must print a log line from your Lambda, using the following format:
`MONITORING|unix_epoch_timestamp|value|metric_type|my.metric.name|#tag1:value,tag2`

Please ensure the `unix_epoch_timestamp` is in seconds (not milliseconds).

For example, here is sample snippet for printing a valid custom metric, from your Lambda function (in Python):

~~~
unix_epoch_timestamp = int(time.time())
value = 42
metric_type = 'count'
metric_name = 'my.metric.name'
tags = ['tag1:value', 'tag2']
print('MONITORING|{0}|{1}|{2}|{3}|#{4}'.format(
    unix_epoch_timestamp, value, metric_type, metric_name, ','.join(tags)
))
~~~

Note: This integration requires the AWS permissions `logs:DescribeLogGroups`, `logs:DescribeLogStreams`, and `logs:FilterLogEvents` to be fully enabled. Also, counts and gauges are the only metrics types currently supported.

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git()%> 

Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
