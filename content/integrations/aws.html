The recommended way to configure Cloudwatch in Datadog is to create a
new user via the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#s=Home">IAM Console</a>
and grant that user (or group of user) Amazon EC2 and Cloudwatch *read-only*
access.

These can be set via policy templates in the console.

Alternatively they can set via Amazon's API according to the following
specifications:

## Amazon Read-Only Access

          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }


<h4>Do you believe you're seeing a discrepancy between your data in Cloudwatch and Datadog?</h4> 
<p>There are two important distinctions to be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>In AWS for counters, a graph that is set to 'sum' '1minute' shows the total number of occurrences
in one minute leading up to that point, i.e. the rate per 1 minute.  Datadog is
displaying the raw data from AWS normalized to per second values, regardless of the 
timeframe selected in AWS, which is why you will probably see our value as lower.</li>

<li>Overall, min/max/avg have a different meaning within AWS than in Datadog. 
In AWS, average latency, 
minimum latency, and maximum latency are three distinct metrics that AWS collects.
When Datadog pulls metrics from AWS Cloudwatch, we only get the average latency as a single time 
series per ELB.
Within Datadog, when you are selecting 'min', 'max', or 'avg', you are
controlling how multiple time series will be combined. For example, requesting
<code>system.cpu.idle</code> without any filter would return one series for each host that
reports that metric and those series need to be combined to be graphed. On the
other hand, if you requested <code>system.cpu.idle</code> from a single host, no aggregation
would be necessary and switching between average and max would yield the same
result.</li>
</ol>
