[AWS OpsWorks](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/ops-works/) is a configuration management service that helps you configure and operate applications of all shapes and sizes using Chef. You can define the applicationâ€™s architecture and the specification of each component including package installation, software configuration and resources such as storage. Start from templates for common technologies like application servers and databases or build your own to perform any task that can be scripted. AWS OpsWorks includes automation to scale your application based on time or load and dynamic configuration to orchestrate changes as your environment scales.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your Ops Works metrics. You can select the Opsworks check box in the [AWS integration tile](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/amazon_web_services).
