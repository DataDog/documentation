### Overview
{:#int-overview}

Capture GitHub commits in Datadog to:

  * Track new features from code changes
  * Identify when new code changes lead to system alerts or build failures
  * Discuss code changes with your team in the Datadog Event Stream



### Configuration
{:#int-configuration}

Select 'Github' [on the account settings screen][1] and link your account. You can then select which repos you would like to integrate, which branches, and if you'd like to receive commits and/or issues.

### What to Expect
{:#int-whattoexpect}

Once the integration is complete, whatever you select (commits and/or issues) will populate into your Datadog Event Stream. If you view a dashboard, in the top left search bar you can type `sources:github` to see github events overlayed over your the graphs on that dashboard.
