# Overview

Connect Memcached to Datadog in order to:

* Visualize its performance
* Correlate the performance of Memcached with the rest of your applications

<%= insert_example_links(conf:"mcache", check:"mcache")%>

# Configuration

1.  Configure the Agent to connect to the Memcached server. Edit conf.d/mcache.yaml:

        init_config:

        instances:
          - url: localhost  # url used to connect to the memcached instance
          #   socket: /socket/path # if url missing; 'dd-agent' user must have read/write permission
          #   port: 11211 # If this line is not present, port will default to 11211
            tags:
              - optional_tag

            options:
              items: false  # set to true if you wish to collect items memcached stats.
              slabs: false  # set to true if you wish to collect slabs memcached stats.
    {:.language-yaml}

1.  Restart the Agent

# Validation

Execute the info command and verify that the integration check has passed. The output of the command should contain a section similar to the following:

    Checks
