Connect your Ruby applications to Datadog to:

* Visualize their performance
* Correlate their performance with the rest of your applications
* Monitor any relevant metric

Datadog offers two libraries to assist you with the implementation of Ruby application metrics:

* [dogstatsd-ruby](https://github.com/DataDog/dogstatsd-ruby) A client for DogStatsD, an extension of the StatsD metric server for Datadog.
* [dogapi-rb](https://github.com/DataDog/dogapi-rb) The Ruby client is a library suitable for inclusion in existing Ruby projects or for development of standalone scripts. It provides an abstraction on top of Datadog's raw HTTP interface for reporting events and metrics.
