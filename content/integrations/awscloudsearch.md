# Overview

Amazon CloudSearch is a managed service in the AWS Cloud that makes it simple and cost-effective to set up, manage, and scale a search solution.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your CloudSearch metrics.

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first](/integrations/aws). There are no other installation steps that need to be performed.

# Configuration

In the Amazon Web Services integration tile, ensure that CloudSearch is checked under metric collection.

# Metrics



Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS will be assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.
