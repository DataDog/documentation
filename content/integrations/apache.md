# Overview

![Apache Graph](/static/images/apachegraph.png)

Get metrics from Apache in real time; graph them and correlate them with other relevant system metrics and events.

  * Visualize your web server performance
  * Correlate the performance of Apache with the rest of your applications


# Installation

Make sure that [`mod_status`][3] is installed on your Apache server with `ExtendedStatus` set to `on`

# Configuration

*To capture Apache metrics you need to install the Datadog agent.*

1.  Configure the agent to connect to Apache. Edit `/etc/dd-agent/conf.d/apache.yaml`

        init_config:

        instances:
          - apache_status_url: http://example.com/server-status?auto
            # apache_user: example_user
            # apache_password: example_password
            tags:
              - instance:foo
            disable_ssl_validation: true # if you want to disable SSL cert validation
    {:.language-yaml}

2. Restart the agent

        sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent restart

<%= insert_example_links %>

# Validation

To ensure the integration is installed correctly, run the agent info command.

    sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent info

You should see something similar to the following if everything is working correctly:
