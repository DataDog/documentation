## Overview

Once you have [created your monitor][1], the Monitor Status page gives you a bird's eye view of your monitor status over time.
This page is split in 3 main sections:

* **[Properties](#properties)**
* **[Status and History](#status-and-history)**
* **[Events](#events)**

These sections are open by default, and can be closed by using the little `>` icon to the left of the section name.

### Monitor status options
Some options are available in the upper right corner of the page:

* **Mute a monitor**:
    Choose to mute a monitor directly on its status page. Use the *Scope* field to narrow your downtime.
    Refer to the [dedicated downtime documentation][2] to learn how to mute multiple scopes or multiple monitors at the same time.

    NOTE: muting or unmuting a monitor via the UI deletes all scheduled downtimes associated with that monitor.

* **Resolve a monitor**:
    Resolve your monitor manually.

* **Configuration options**:
  Use the *cog* icon to display options available:
    * [Edit][1]
    * Clone
    * [Export][3]
    * Delete

## Properties

{{< img src="monitors/monitor_status/status_monitor_properties.png" alt="status monitor properties" responsive="true" style="width:80%;" >}}

The *Properties* section is the overview of your monitor:

- The status of your monitor
- The monitor creator
- The monitor ID ([for the monitor API][4])
- Tags attached to your monitor. *Edit the tag list by clicking on the pencil icon*.
- The monitor [query][5]
- The monitor message

Use the *cog* icon in the upper right corner of the page to [edit][1] your monitor properties.

## Status and History

The *Status and History* section reflect the query and state changes over time, while the **Evaluation Graph** represents the exact query behavior within the timeframe bracket *on the history graph*. The Evaluation Graph has a fixed zoomed window that corresponds to your monitor evaluation timesteps, to ensure the displayed points are not [incorrectly aggregated][6]. Slide this bracket over the timeline in order to view previous monitor evaluation results:

For further investigation into your metrics evolution, use the [Metric Explorer][7] or a dedicated [Notebook][8].

**Note**: For the *Status* graph, if you see `None` or `no groups found` as group names, this is usually because:  
- The monitor is newly created and has not evaluated yet.  
- The monitor's query was recently changed.  
- A host's name previously included in query has changed. Host name changes age out of the UI within 24 hours.

## Events

All events generated from your monitor are aggregated in this section. Those events are also displayed in your [event stream][9].
