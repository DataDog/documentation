## Overview

Notifications are a key component of any monitor. You want to make sure the
right people get notified so the problem can be resolved as soon as possible.

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/notification.png" alt="notification" responsive="true">}}

1. Give your monitor a **title**. It is often useful to use a succinct
   explanation of the monitor so a notified team member can quickly understand
   what is going on.

2. Enter a **message** for the monitor. This field allows standard
   [markdown formatting](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
   as well as Datadog's @-notification syntax. Note: you can notify any
   non-Datadog users via email by simply adding `@their-email` to the
   message. A common use-case for the monitor message is to include a step-by-step way to resolve the problem. For example if you are monitoring a database then you might want to include steps for failing over to a standby node. All in all, you should attempt to give as much context to the monitor as possible.

3. Optionally enable **monitor renotification**. This option is useful to remind your team that a problem is not solved until the monitor is marked as resolved. If enabled, you can configure an escalation message to be sent anytime the monitor renotifies. The original message will be included as well.


## Message template variables

Message template variables can be used to customize your monitor notifications.
This feature is supported in all monitor types. There are two primary use cases
for template variables: 1) displaying a different message depending on the
notification type (e.g. triggered, recovered, no data) and 2) incorporating the
triggering scope into the message of multi alerts.

### Conditional variables for different notification types
You can have a monitor event display a different message depending on whether the event is a trigger, warning, recovery, or no data notification. These variables use simple if-else logic with the following syntax:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/conditionalvars.png" alt="conditional vars" responsive="true">}}

Here is an example of how you can set it up in the editor:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/templateconditionaleditor.png" alt="template conditional editor" responsive="true">}}

The corresponding trigger event notification will look like this:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/templateconditionaltrigger.png" alt="template condiional trigger" responsive="true" >}}

and the recovery notification:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/templateconditionalrecover.png" alt="template conditional recover" responsive="true">}}


The conditional variables available are:

* `is_alert`, 
* `is_alert_recovery`,
* `is_warning`, 
* `is_warning_recovery`, 
* `is_recovery`, 
* `is_no_data`.

These can also be seen in the "Use message template variables" help box in
Step 3 of the monitor editor.

### Tag variables for multi alerts
When your monitor is a multi alert, instead of having a generic message (and finding the triggering tag scope in the alert query definition), a variable can be used in the message for explicitly identifying the triggering scope.

Here is an example of how you can use template variables for a multi alert:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/templatevareditor.png" alt="template var editor" responsive="true">}}

and the corresponding event notification:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/templatevar.png" alt="template var" responsive="true">}}


The tag template variables available depend on the tag group selected in Step 1 of the monitor editor. The possible options will automatically populate at the bottom of the "Use message template variables" help box in Step 3 of the editor.
These variables can also be used in the monitor titles (names), but note that the variables are only populated in the text of Datadog child events (not the parent, which displays an aggregation summary).

Some tags identifying your triggering scope will automatically be inserted into the title of your multi alert. If your scope is defined by a lot of tags, your alert title may end up being undesirably long. If you've used template tag variables to include this information in the body of your alert, you can uncheck

### Include triggering tags in notification title

In order to save some space, you can Include triggering tags in notification title. This will make your notification title look like this:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/templatevar_short.png" alt="template var short" responsive="true">}}

Note that template variable content is escaped by default. If your variable
contains JSON or code that you would NOT like to be escaped, then use triple braces instead of double braces (e.g. `{{{event.text}}}`).

### Conditional variables for different triggering scopes
You can have a monitor event display a different message depending on the group that's causing a notification.

The `{{is_match}}` conditional lets you match the triggering context to some
string. For example, you might want to notify your db team if a triggering
host has `role:db` but notify your app team if the host has `role:app`.

You can use any of the available tag variables in your condition. A match
will be made if the comparison string is anywhere in the resolved variable.

The variable uses the following format:

  {{#is_match "tag_variable" "comparison_string"}}
  This will show if comparison_string is in tag_variable.
  {{/is_match}}

Here is an example of how you can give a different message depending on the triggering context:

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/scope_match_editor.png" alt="scope match editor" responsive="true" >}}

## Variable availability

We provide a number of different types of monitors and not all variables are available for each type of monitor. Integration monitor variables are largely dependent on the specific integration and monitor configuration.

Note that some monitors offer addtional contextual variables based on what you are monitoring. For example, host monitors may provide variables for `host.availability-zone` and `host.cloud_provider`. You can see a complete list of contextual template variables available to your monitor by clicking the "Use message template variables" link or in the list of suggestions that appears when you type `{{` to begin a template variable name.
## Monitor Template Variable Explained 
### {{comparator}}

The {{comparator}} template variable's value is always a relational operator. It will correlate to the relational value selected in the monitor's "Set alert conditions" section:
{{< img src="monitors/notifications/comparator_alert.png" alt="comparator_alert" responsive="true">}}

For example, when an alert set to trigger when a value rises "above" 50, this syntax:
```
  {{value}} {{comparator}} {{threshold}}
```
would yield a notification message like the following:
```
    51.47 > 50
```

### {{is_match}}

This template variable allows you to trigger an alert based on the tags defined in your scope.

 The variable uses the following format:
```
{{#is_match "tag_variable" "comparison_string"}}
This will show if comparison_string is in tag_variable.
{{/is_match}}
```

### {{is_recovery}} or {{is_alert_recovery}} 

* {{is_recovery}} will trigger and a monitor recovers indifferently either from a **WARNING** state or an **ALERT** state. 
* {{is_alert_recovery}} will trigger when a monitor recovers directly from an **ALERT** state to **OK** state. 
* {{is_warning_recovery}} will trigger when a monitor recovers from a **WARNING** state to **OK** state

This means that if the monitor switches from ALERT to WARNING then OK state:

* the {{is_recovery}} would trigger
* the {{is_alert_recovery}} wouldn't trigger 
* the {{is_warning_recovery}} would trigger. 

The @ notification inside the template variables will follow the same rules. 

## Include links to appropriate dashboards in your Monitor Notifications

Many organizations today would like to include additional context to their Alerts.  Quick links to relevant dashboards as a part of the Alert has proven to reduce the overall time it takes during the break fix process to reduce time to resolution. 

Datadog makes message template variables available to each defined monitor.  Using these variables, you can dynamically build a URL that will link Datadog Users to an appropriate dashboard using the scope of the monitor.

The are a few examples of providing links to items like System Dashboards, Integration Dashboards, HostMaps and Managed Monitors pages. 

First example to review is the most common.  Let’s say you would like to provide a link to a System Dashboard when a monitor for a specific system metric has exceeded your defined threshold.  The message template variable that can be leveraged in this instance would be {{host.name}}.  Include the following URL as a part of your Monitor “Say What’s Happening” section: 

```
https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/system_overview?tpl_var_scope=host:{{host.name}}
```

As you can see, `{{host.name}}` will be replaced with the offending host of the monitor in question. 

{{< img src="monitors/notifications/system_dashboard_url.png" alt="system_dashboard_url" responsive="true">}}

Below you will find additional examples of links that could be added to Monitors to provide Datadog Users quick access to common pages leveraged during the break fix and triage process.

* **Hostmaps** - If you would like to include a HostMap to compare metrics with other similar hosts, you can use a link like below to be included in your Monitor: 
```
https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map?fillby=avg%3Acpuutilization&sizeby=avg%3Anometric&filter=cassandra 
```
The above link has more customizable options than your standard System Dashboard.  Here you have additional variables to define.  Most common variables passed into this URL are the following: 

**Fillby, sizeby, filter**: Fill by can be defined by adding fillby:avg:<MetricName>.  Size by can be defined by adding sizeby:avg:<SecondMetricName>.  Filter can be used to specify a specific integration (i.e. Cassandra, mysql, apache, snmp, etc) by adding filter=<integration_name>
{{< img src="monitors/notifications/hostmap_url.png" alt="hostmap_url" responsive="true">}}

The above will color fill the hexagons by system.cpu.system, it will size the hexagons by system.cpu.stolen and add a filter to only include Cassandra hosts. 

**Integration Dashboards**- If you are building Application or Integration specific Monitors, you can link to that specific Integration Dashboard as well as adding a scope for the host that triggered the monitor.  In the example below all that is necessary to populate is the <integration_name> section for something like Cassandra, apache, snmp, etc as well as providing the scope for the offending host:

```
https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/integration/<integration_name>?tpl_var_scope=host:{{host.name}}
```
{{< img src="monitors/notifications/integration_url.png" alt="integration_url" responsive="true">}}

**Manage Monitors Page** – If you would like to link to a Manage monitors page that displays all of the monitors for the host in question, you can define a link like below:  
```
https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage?q=scope:host:{{host.name}}
```

The above will link to all monitors for this host.  You have other options available to further refine the link.  For example, if you would only like monitors that are in an Alert State, you can add the following status:Alert (other statuses that can be leveraged are WARN, NO%20DATA, OK and MUTED).  Below is an example link:
```
https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage?q=scope:host:{{host.name}}&status:Alert
```
{{< img src="monitors/notifications/monitor_url.png" alt="monitor_url" responsive="true">}}

If you would like all monitors for a specific application or integration, you can add the following query to the URL q=<integration_name> : 
```
https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage?q=cassandra
```

## Using message template variables to dynamically create @-mentions 

Use message template variables within a monitor message to dynamically build **@-mentions**.  

For example, if the rendered variable is setup as a channel in the Slack integration: 

* `@slack-{{owner.name}}` post a slack DM message directly the owner of this monitor.

* `@slack-{{host.name}}` post a slack message to the #host.name channel in Slack.
