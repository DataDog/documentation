* Yes, this can be done! Here is an example for creating a disk space in use
alert when at 80% or above:
  1. Select a metric like "system.disk.in_use".
  2. Select the "threshold alert" type.
  3. For set alert grouping, select "simple alert".
  4. Set alert conditions: Select Above and for the value put 0.8.
  5. Add a custom message for alert if you'd like.
