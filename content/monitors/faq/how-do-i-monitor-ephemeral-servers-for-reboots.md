title: How do I monitor ephemeral servers for reboots?

Ephemeral environments spin up and terminate hosts constantly which can make it challenging to distinguish new hosts from rebooted hosts.

A metric monitor on the system.uptime metric can be used to address this. The uptime metric is an ever increasing timer which resets to 0 when a host boots up and can be evaluated using the diff() [function](/graphing/miscellaneous/functions), to distinguish between a start at 0 (new server) and a change (diff) of a running uptime value to a 0 value.

The example shown below captures how this can be setup:
