title: I have a downtime scheduled on my monitor, why did it still alert?!

When you [schedule a downtime](/monitors/downtimes) over a specific tag scope, the downtime will apply "AND" logic to those tags. So if you wanted to set up a downtime over host:A and host:B, then the downtime will silence only those monitors that alert on evaluation groups that contain both tags host:A and host:B (and such a downtime would likely not silence any alerts).

If you want to schedule a downtime over a subset of hosts, a good way to do so is to find a host-tag common to all those hosts and scope the downtime by that tag. One easy way you can take advantage of to create new host-tags directly in the Datadog UI from your [Infrastructure List](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure) and [Host Map](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map) by selecting a host and hitting the "Edit Tags" button (shown below), or via [our API](/api/#tags-add).
