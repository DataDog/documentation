For the AWS No Data errors, the issue here has to do with how frequently we
receive AWS metrics. Because our crawlers are rate-limited by the Cloudwatch
APIs, data is often delayed by 10 or more minutes, so we generally recommend
that an alert for an AWS metric be set to have a threshold window of at least
30 minutes or an hour (you can see this in step 3 of alert creation, “during
the last…”). Switching the time frame on this alert will resolve this issue, or
you can install the agent on some AWS hosts to get more up-to-date data to
alert on. Overall, we’re always working towards getting data more efficiently
from AWS.
