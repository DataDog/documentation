We offer reporting in a variety of ways so far, which include:

* The ability to [embed any chart anywhere](/graphing/faq/is-there-a-way-to-share-graphs). Pick a graph on a dashboard, click on the cog to edit it and you’ll find the “share” tab that will generate an iFrame.
* For certain sources (e.g. PagerDuty), you’ll get a report in your mailbox once a week to go over past alerts.
* Metric alerts provide a way to report changes that are outside of what you define as **normal**.
