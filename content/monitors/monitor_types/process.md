A process monitor will watch the status produced by the `process.up` service
check reported by the check in the Agent. At the Agent level you can configure
thresholds based on the number of matching processes.

Read more about configuration on the [Process Check](/integrations/process/)
page.

For each process, a single service check status will be produced. Through this
creation interface, you can choose which of those checks to monitor and at what
point they should notify.

1. Pick the **process** to monitor. You will see the names configured in any
   Agent with an active process check.

2. Pick the **monitor scope**. You will only see hosts or tags that
   are reporting a status for the selected process.

3. Select **alerting options**. Please refer to the
   [custom monitors](#custom-monitors) section for details on the available options.

4. Configure your **notification options** Refer to the
   [Notifications](#monitor-notifications) section of this guide for a detailed
   walkthrough of the common notification options.
