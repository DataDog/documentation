Network monitors cover the TCP and HTTP checks available in the Agent. Read
the [guide to network checks](/integrations/tcp_check) for details on Agent
configuration.

## Network Status

1. Choose a **network check**. You will be able to choose from all HTTP and TCP
   checks being submitted by your Agents.

2. Pick **monitor scope**. You will only see hosts or tags reporting
   the check you have chosen.

3. Select **alerting options**.

4. Configure your **notification options** Refer to the
   [Notifications](/monitors/notifications) section of this guide for a detailed
   walkthrough of the common notification options.

## Network Metric

1. Choose a **network metric**. You will be able to choose either the TCP or
   HTTP response time metric.

2. Pick **monitor scope**. You will only see hosts or tags reporting
   the metric you have chosen.

3. Select **alerting options**. Please refer to the
   [alert-conditions](#metrics-monitors) section for details on the available
   options.

4. Configure your **notification options** Refer to the
   [Notifications](/monitors/notifications) section of this guide for a detailed walkthrough of the common notification options.


##  Built a network monitor on an http check.

[Once you have created an HTTP check](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/http_check/) with your Datadog Agent, you might want to monitor it on your Datadog application

To build a Network monitor on an http check you need to:
1 - Create a network monitor: Monitor > New monitor
​2 - Enter your network monitor setting:

​{{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/network/network_monitor_settings.png" alt="alert type"  responsive="true" >}}

Don't forget to select the threshold values for your monitor

3 - Configure the 4 - "Say what's happening" section to receive the correct notification.

Note: Contrary to metric monitor it's not possible to get alerted after the endpoint is unavailable for X min. Instead you can only be alert after 5 max consecutive bad statuses. Unless a high timeout value is used in the agent config, if a site goes down this translates into 5 * ~15-20 seconds (agent collection period) i.e. 1min30 without data.
