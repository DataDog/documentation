*Requires Datadog Agent version >= 5.0.0.*

## Overview

Every Datadog Agent collection reports a heartbeat called `datadog.agent.up`
with a status `UP`. You can monitor this heartbeat across one or more hosts.

## Configuration

1. Select your **host by name or tag(s)**. Providing a tag monitors every host that has that tag or tag combination.

2. Select the **no-data timeframe**: If the heartbeat stops reporting for more than the number of minutes you have selected, then you get notified.

3. Configure your **notification options**:  
    Refer to the [Notifications](/monitors/notifications) dedicated documentation page for a detailed walkthrough of the common notification options.
