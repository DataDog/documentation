Every Datadog Agent collection reports a heartbeat called `datadog.agent.up`
with a status `UP`. You can monitor this heartbeat across one or more hosts.

1. Select your **host by name or tag(s)**. Providing a tag will monitor every
   host that has that tag or tag combination.

2. Select the **no-data timeframe**. If the heartbeat stops reporting for more
   than the number of minutes you have selected, then you will get notified.

3. Configure your **notification options** Refer to the
   [Notifications](monitors/notifications) section of this guide for a detailed
   walkthrough of the common notification options.
