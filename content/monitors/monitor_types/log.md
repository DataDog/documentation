## Overview

Log monitors alert when a specified type of log exceeds a user-defined threshold over a given period of time. Common use cases for this monitor include:

* Code exception errors monitoring 
* Build job notifications

## Setup

1. Define the search query:
    {{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/log/define_the_search_query.png" alt="Define the search query" responsive="true" style="width:50%;" >}}
    The search query has the same behavior as [the log explorer search][1]

2. (Optional) Define the alert grouping:
  {{< img src="monitors/monitor_types/log/log_monitor_group_by.png" alt="Set alert conditions" responsive="true" style="width:50%;" >}}
    With or without alert grouping defined, you get one alert when the aggregated value meets the conditions set below. Even if you split the query by host, a single notification is sent if several hosts meet the conditions set below. This is done to reduce notification noise.

3. Set alert conditions. The following options can be used:

* Above
* Above or equal

Then configure the Alert and/or Warning threshold depending on the chosen condition:

4. Configure your **notification options**:  
    Refer to the [notifications][2] dedicated documentation page for detailed options.
    

## Notifications and log samples

It is possible to add up to 10 samples of logs that triggered the monitor in the notification message.
This is available for Slack and email notifications.

Samples are not available for multi-alerts.

 **Enable log samples in notification message**
