[Administrators](http://localhost:1313/account_management/team/#datadog-user-roles) can access the [organization account settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing) by clicking Plan & Usage from the Account menu in the left side navigation or from the "Go to organization settings" button at the top of the Account Settings page.

## Plan settings

Upgrade or downgrade your account from the Plan tab on the Organization Account Settings page. 
**Note**: Contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com](mailto://success@datadoghq.com) to add or remove paid features that are not part of standard plans.

## Usage reports

View hourly usage of your account across all billable parameters as well as the top 500 custom metrics submitted. If your organization is the parent-organization in a [multi-org account](/account_management/multi_organization/), you will also be able to view the usage of child-organization accounts. Individual child-organization accounts are isolated and will only be able to view their own usage and custom metrics.

Further detailed usage reports can also be created [on request](mailto://success@datadoghq.com) by your account representative.

## Billing history

Your account billing history is available from the Billing History tab on the [Organization Account Settings page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing). For specific billing questions, contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com](mailto://success@datadoghq.com).

## Change your organization name

To rename your organization, enter the new name, then click save. 
**Note**: **Your organization name may not exceed 32 characters**.
