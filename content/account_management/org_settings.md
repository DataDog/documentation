[Administrators](http://localhost:1313/account_management/team/#datadog-user-roles) can access the [organization account settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing) by clicking Plan & Usage from the Account menu in the left side navigation or from the "Go to organization settings" button at the top of the Account Settings page.

## Plan settings

You can upgrade or downgrade your account from the Plan tab on the Organization Account Settings page. Note that in order to add or remove paid features that are not part of standard plans, you will have to contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com](mailto://success@datadoghq.com).

## Usage reports

You can view hourly usage of your account across all billable parameters as well as the top 500 custom metrics submitted. If your organization is the parent-organization in a [multi-org account](/account_management/multi_organization/), you will also be able to view the usage of child-organization accounts. Individual child-organization accounts are isolated and will only be able to view their own usage and custom metrics.

Further detailed usage reports can also be created on request by your account representative.

## Billing history

Your account billing history is available from the Billing History tab on the Organization Account Settings page. For specific billing questions, contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com](mailto://success@datadoghq.com).

## Change your organization name

To rename your organization, enter the new name, then click save. Note that your organization name may not exceed 32 characters.
