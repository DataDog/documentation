The admin of the account should enter the email addresses of team members
[here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/team). Some team best practices are as follows:

* When the team member receives the confirmation email, they will be provided with a link to log in directly. The user should not click ‘sign up’ during this process.
* If multiple users from the same organization sign up separately, it will create multiple organizations which do not share data. If your team has created multiple organizations and would like to merge them, support can assist in doing so. However, please note that only users are transferred. Data such as metrics or monitors created in the account being merged will not be transferred.
* Users can be placed in one of three permissions categories which include Read Only, Standard, and Administrator. Learn more about those roles [here](/account_management/team/#datadog-user-roles)

* To disable a team member's access to an organization, an admin user must click the “disable” button by a given user's avatar on the team page. Disabled users will remain visible on the [team page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/team), but in the disabled state. Disabled users/team members will disappear from the admin's team page UI automatically after one month.
