Yes. Onboarding a new sub-organization with a set of baseline dashboards and monitors can be done programmatically via our [API](/api) with tools such as Terraform (see our [blog](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/managing-datadog-with-terraform/) for details) or via [scripts](/developers/faq/can-i-backup-dashboards-or-monitors)) to backup existing dashboards and monitors as code.

This enables version control within a sub-organization as well as streamlines provisioning of new Datadog sub-organizations. Each integration (such as AWS, GCP & Azure) comes with multiple out of the box templated dashboards that can be cloned and edited as well.
