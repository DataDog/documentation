It is! There is the [multi-account feature][1]  to help creating new organizations that is not currently enabled by default so the first thing you'll have to do is send a note to support@datadoghq.com asking them to enable new account creation for your organization.

Once this feature has been enabled you'll be able to access [this organization creation page][2] to define new orgs:

Note: your new organization name must be **32 characters or fewer**.

Administrators users can access this organization creation page from the menu that appears when hovering over their avatar in the lower lefthand corner, and then clicking on "Create New Organization":

After creating your organizations, you'll be able to switch between any Datadog accounts you're associated with from this same menu.

Once the new organization has been set up, you can invite people to your new org from the Team page the same as you would your regular account.
