All data coming from Datadog Webhooks and integrations, such as those with ticketing systems like ServiceNow and JIRA, are coming from the following set of static IPs.
 
* 52.20.96.17
* 34.192.254.186
* 34.204.102.208

More information on network traffic and security can be found [on the agent proxy dedicated documentation page](/agent/proxy).
