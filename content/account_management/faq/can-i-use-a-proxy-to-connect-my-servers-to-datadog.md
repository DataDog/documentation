title: Can I use a proxy to connect my servers to Datadog?
kind: faq

If your network configuration restricts outbound traffic, [proxy all Agent traffic][1] through one or several hosts that have more permissive outbound policies.

You have a few options to send traffic to Datadog over SSL/TLS for hosts that are not directly connected to the Internet: 

* [Using the Agent as a proxy][2] (for up to 16 Agents per proxy)
* [Using a web proxy][3] (e.g. Squid, Microsoft Web Proxy) that is already deployed in your network
* [Using HAProxy][4] (High volume solution. A single HAProxy instance can accommodate traffic from ~1000 Datadog Agents)

Here is a common scenario with an Amazon VPC:

In the above, the six EC2 instances in the VPC aren't Internet facing, however, they have communication to a single instance that is and are using it to route local traffic to Datadog via 443 TCP.

In the above, the six physical servers in the data center aren't Internet facing, however, they have communication to a single instance acting as a proxy that is open and may be used to route local traffic (one way) from the hosts out to Datadog via 443 TCP/HTTPS for external communication.
