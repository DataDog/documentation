Datadog offers 3 ways to quickly provision users to their respective organizations:

* Batches of users can be added via UI within the [Team tab](/account_management/team)
* [API user creation](/api/#user)
* Use an authentication service like [SAML](/account_management/saml). [Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning](/account_management/saml/#just-in-time-provisioning-jit-provisioning) can be enabled allowing users with valid single sign-on credentials to have their Datadog organization automatically created when they attempt to log in.
