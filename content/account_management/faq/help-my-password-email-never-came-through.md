When a new user creates an account, your login email (or "handle") defaults to your email address. This can cause some confusion when a user wants to update their email. 

A user can update their communications email independently in the UI, but they aren't able to update their handle without help from support. This means that after updating their communication email address on their own, they will still need to sign in with their old email address.

When attempting to reset your password please check if you previously changed your email in the Datadog platform.

You can confirm this from the team page as shown here:

You will need to enter your email address in the password reset link:

https://app.datadoghq.com/account/forgot_password 

If you have confirmed your email address is correct and you still have not received your password reset email please check your spam and filtered emails. 
Once you have confirmed that you have not received your email please contact [us](/help)
