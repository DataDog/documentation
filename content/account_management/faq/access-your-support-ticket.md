If you already have opened at least one ticket to support@datadoghq.com follow this process to access all your Datadog support tickets:

* Get a password from Zendesk by clicking this link on the sign in page of this website: `https://help.datadoghq.com`
    {{< img src="help/sign_in.png" alt="sing in" responsive="true" >}}

Once you received the password, when you log in, you should be then directed to this location: `https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/requests`

From here, you should be able to see your requests:
    {{< img src="help/my_activities.png" alt="my activities" responsive="true" >}}

However, if you don't see this after logging in, click on your name in the upper right hand corner, and then select "My Activities" from there.

If you would like to view your entire organization's tickets, please reach out to our support team at support@datadoghq.com directly.
