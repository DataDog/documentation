Users can access the Create New Organization feature in the settings (reach out to your account rep. to enable this feature). This feature allows all admin users in the parent account to create new sub-organizations. New sub-organizations will be treated as completely separate entities, allowing users to be part of multiple Datadog organizations, each with data accessible only to users within those organizations.
