title: As a parent account admin, how do I create new sub-organizations?

Users can access the [Create New Organization][1] feature in the settings (reach out to your account rep. to enable this feature).  
This feature allows all administrator users in the parent account to create new sub-organizations. New sub-organizations are treated as completely separate entities, allowing users to be part of multiple Datadog organizations, each with data accessible only to users within those organizations.
