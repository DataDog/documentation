## Overview

Datadog has many pricing plans to fit your needs. Visit the [Pricing][1] page for more details.

## Hourly

Datadog supports hourly pricing. The standard hourly rate for Datadog Pro is $0.03 per host, per hour.

Choose to pay for all of your hosts hourly, or commit to a subset of hosts on a monthly or annual plan and pay any additional hosts on an hourly basis (billed at the end of each month). This could be less expensive for extra hosts that are up for a short time, but more than monthly rates if the hosts are up for extended periods of time.

Contact [Sales][2] or your Customer Success Manager to discuss hourly pricing for your account.
