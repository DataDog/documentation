The new user will receive an email with a link to login.

## Datadog User roles
Datadog provides 3 user roles:

* **Admins** have access to billing information, the ability to revoke API keys, removing users, and can configure read-only dashboards. They can also promote standard users to Admins.

* A **standard user** has access to view and modify all monitoring features that Datadog offers such as dashboards, monitors, events, and notebooks.

* **Read only users** are created by admins and do not have access to edit within Datadog. This comes in handy when you'd like to share specific read-only views with a client or where a member of one business unit needs to share a dashboard with someone outside their unit.

## Disable Existing Members

**NOTE:** You must be an Admin of the team to disable members

1. Go to the [Team Page][1].
2. Hover over the avatar for the user you wish to disable. Choose **Disable** from the menu.
