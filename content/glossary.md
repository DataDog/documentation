**Multiple-organization accounts (multi-org accounts)**. Multi-org accounts allow a parent-organization to create multiple child-organizations. This is most often used with Managed Service Providers (MSPs) that have many customers. Each customer requires their own organization that is not accessible by other customers. All billing for multi-org accounts will be performed on the parent-organization and usage reports for the parent-organization will include usage information for all child-organizations.
