Trace Agent packages are available for:

* Linux — packaged with the Datadog Agent since v5.11.0
* Mac OS — packaged separately, see the [Trace Agent releases](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/releases/)
* Docker — included in the [docker-dd-agent](https://github.com/DataDog/docker-dd-agent) container

For other platforms, you must install from source.

## Can I deploy the Trace Agent to any PaaS providers?

Yes, you can deploy it to Heroku via the [Datadog Heroku Buildpack](https://github.com/DataDog/heroku-buildpack-datadog).
