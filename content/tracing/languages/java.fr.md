## Compatibility

We officially support the Java JRE 1.7 and higher of both Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.  Other JVM compatible languages (Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, etc) should work, but may be missing the instrumentation needed to be useful.  To see what web frameworks, libraries, and datastores we support, see the [Integrations section](#integrations).

To improve visibility into applications using unsupported frameworks, consider:

* Adding custom instrumentation (with OpenTracing or the `@Trace` annotation).
* [Submitting a pull request](https://github.com/DataDog/documentation#outside-contributors) with instrumentation for inclusion in a future release.
* [Contact support](/help) and submit a feature request.



## Installation and Getting Started

To begin tracing applications written in any language, first [install and configure the Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing#installing-the-agent).

Next, download `dd-java-agent.jar` that contains the agent class files:

```shell
wget -O dd-java-agent.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=com.datadoghq&a=dd-java-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Finally, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, your Maven or Gradle application script, or your `java -jar` command:

```
-javaagent:/path/to/the/dd-java-agent.jar
```

## Configuration

The tracer is configured using System Properties and Environment Variables as follows:

| Config             | System Property       | Environment Variable      |  Default           | Description |
|:------------------ |:--------------------- |:------------------------- |:------------------ |:----- |
| service.name       | dd.service.name       | DD_SERVICE_NAME           | `unnamed-java-app` | The name of a set of processes that do the same job. Used for grouping stats for your application.|
| writer.type        | dd.writer.type        | DD_WRITER_TYPE            | `DDAgentWriter`    | Default value sends traces to the trace agent. Configuring with `LoggingWriter` instead writes traces out to the console. |
| agent.host         | dd.agent.host         | DD_AGENT_HOST             | `localhost`        | Hostname for where to send traces to. If using a containerized environment, configure this to be the host ip.  See our [docker docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/docker/) for additional detail. |
| agent.port         | dd.agent.port         | DD_AGENT_PORT             | `8126`             | Port number the agent is listening on for configured host. |
| priority.sampling  | dd.priority.sampling  | DD_PRIORITY_SAMPLING      | `false`            | Changes how the client and agent sample traces. See [Sampling / distributed tracing](#sampling-distributed-tracing) section for details. |

**Note**: If the same key type is set for both, the system property configuration takes priority.

## Manual Instrumentation

Before instrumenting your application, review Datadog’s [APM Terminology](/tracing/terminology/) and familiarize yourself with the core concepts of Datadog APM. If you aren't using a [supported framework instrumentation](#integrations), or you would like additional depth in your application’s traces, you may want to to manually instrument your code.
Do this either using the [Trace annotation](#trace-annotation) for simple method call tracing or with the [OpenTracing API](#opentracing-api) for complex tracing.

### Trace Annotation

Add the `dd-trace-api` dependency to your project. For Maven, add this to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.datadoghq</groupId>
    <artifactId>dd-trace-api</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add:

```gradle
compile group: 'com.datadoghq', name: 'dd-trace-api', version: {version}
```

Now add `@Trace` to methods to have them be traced when running with `dd-java-agent.jar`.  If the agent is not attached, this annotation will have no effect on your application.

### OpenTracing API

Use the [OpenTracing API](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java) and the Datadog Tracer (dd-trace-ot) library to measure execution times for specific pieces of code. This lets you trace your application more precisely than you can with the Java Agent alone.

#### Setup

For Maven, add this to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- OpenTracing API -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentracing-api</artifactId>
    <version>0.31.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- OpenTracing Util -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentracing-util</artifactId>
    <version>0.31.0</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Datadog Tracer (only needed if you do not use dd-java-agent) -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.datadoghq</groupId>
    <artifactId>dd-trace-ot</artifactId>
    <version>${dd-trace-java.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add:

```
compile group: 'io.opentracing', name: 'opentracing-api', version: "0.31.0"
compile group: 'io.opentracing', name: 'opentracing-util', version: "0.31.0"
compile group: 'com.datadoghq', name: 'dd-trace-ot', version: "${dd-trace-java.version}"
```

Configure your application using environment variables or system properties as discussed in the [configuration](#configuration) section.

#### Custom Instrumentation Examples

Use a combination of these if the automatic instrumentation isn’t providing you enough depth or detail.

Using try-finally:

```java
import datadog.trace.api.DDTags;

import io.opentracing.Scope;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import io.opentracing.util.GlobalTracer;

class InstrumentedClass {

    void method0() {
        /*
         * 1. Configure your application using environment variables or system properties
         * 2. Using dd-java-agent (-javaagent:/path/to/dd-java-agent.jar),
         *    GlobalTracer is automatically instantiated.
         */
        Tracer tracer = GlobalTracer.get();

        Scope scope = tracer.buildSpan("operation-name").startActive(true);
        try {
            scope.span().setTag(DDTags.SERVICE_NAME, "my-new-service");

            // The code you're tracing
            Thread.sleep(1000);

        // If you don't call close(), the span data will NOT make it to Datadog!
        } finally {
            scope.close();
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, wrap the code you want to trace in a `try-with-resources` statement:

```java
import datadog.trace.api.DDTags;

import io.opentracing.Scope;
import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import io.opentracing.util.GlobalTracer;

class InstrumentedClass {

    void method0() {
        Tracer tracer = GlobalTracer.get();

        try (Scope scope = tracer.buildSpan("operation-name").startActive(true)) {
            scope.span().setTag(DDTags.SERVICE_NAME, "my-new-service");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, you dont need to call `scope.close()`.

If you’re not using `dd-trace-java.jar`, you must register a configured tracer with `GlobalTracer`. This can be easily done by calling `GlobalTracer.register(new DDTracer())` early on in your application startup (ie, main method).

```java
import datadog.opentracing.DDTracer;
import datadog.trace.api.sampling.AllSampler;
import datadog.trace.common.writer.DDAgentWriter;

import io.opentracing.Tracer;
import io.opentracing.util.GlobalTracer;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Initialize the tracer from environment variables or system properties
        Tracer tracer = new DDTracer();
        GlobalTracer.register(tracer);

        // OR from the API
        Writer writer = new DDAgentWriter();
        Sampler sampler = new AllSampler();
        Tracer tracer = new DDTracer(writer, sampler);
        GlobalTracer.register(tracer);

        // ...
    }
}
```

Notice the above examples only use the OpenTracing classes. Please reference the [OpenTracing API](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java) for more details and information.

## Sampling / distributed tracing

Priority sampling ensures that distributed traces are complete by assigning and propagating a priority value along each trace.

Current Priority Values (more may be added in the future):

|Sampling Value | Effect                                                                                                     |
|---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|SAMPLER_DROP   | The sampler automatically decided to not keep the trace. The Agent will drop it.                           |
|SAMPLER_KEEP   | The sampler automatically decided to keep the trace. The Agent will keep it. Might be sampled server-side. |
|USER_DROP      | The user asked to not keep the trace. The Agent will drop it.                                              |
|USER_KEEP      | The user asked to keep the trace. The Agent will keep it. The server will keep it too.                     |


Priority sampling is disabled by default. To enable it, configure the `priority.sampling` flag to `true` ([see how to configure the client above](#configuration)).

Once enabled, the sampler automatically assigns a priority to traces, depending on their service and volume.

You can also set this priority manually to either drop a non-interesting trace or to keep an important one.
```java
import datadog.opentracing.DDSpan;
import datadog.trace.api.Trace;
import datadog.trace.common.sampling.PrioritySampling;
import io.opentracing.util.GlobalTracer;

public class MyClass {
    @Trace
    public static void myMethod() {
        // grab the active span out of the traced method
        DDSpan ddspan = (DDSpan) GlobalTracer.get().activeSpan();
        // ask the sampler to keep the current trace
        ddspan.setSamplingPriority(PrioritySampling.USER_KEEP);
        // method impl follows
    }
}
```

## Integrations

### Web Frameworks

`dd-java-agent` includes support for automatically tracing the following web frameworks.

| Server | Versions |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| Java Servlet Compatible | 2.3+, 3.0+ |

*Note:* Many application servers are Servlet compatible, such as Tomcat, Jetty, Websphere, Weblogic, etc.
Also, frameworks like Spring Boot and Dropwizard inherently work because they use a Servlet compatible embedded application server.
