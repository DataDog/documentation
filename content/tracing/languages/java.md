## Installation and Getting Started

To begin tracing applications written in any language, first [install and configure the Datadog Agent][1], see the additional documentation for [tracing Docker applications][2] or [Kubernetes applications][3].

Next, download `dd-java-agent.jar` that contains the Agent class files:

```shell
wget -O dd-java-agent.jar 'https://search.maven.org/classic/remote_content?g=com.datadoghq&a=dd-java-agent&v=LATEST'
```

Finally, add the following JVM argument when starting your application in your IDE, Maven or Gradle application script, or `java -jar` command:

```
-javaagent:/path/to/the/dd-java-agent.jar
```

## Automatic Instrumentation

Automatic instrumentation for Java uses the `java-agent` instrumentation capabilities [provided by the JVM][4]. When a `java-agent` is registered, it has the ability to modify class files at load time.
The `java-agent` uses the [Byte Buddy framework][5] to find the classes defined for instrumentation and modify those class bytes accordingly.

Instrumentation may come from auto-instrumentation, the OpenTracing api, or a mixture of both. Instrumentation generally captures the following info:

* Timing duration is captured using the JVM's nanotime clock unless a timestamp is provided from the OpenTracing api
* Key/value tag pairs
* Errors and stacktraces which are unhanded by the application
* A total count of traces (requests) flowing through the system

## Compatibility

Datadog officially supports the Java JRE 1.7 and higher of both Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.

**Web Framework tracing provides:** timing HTTP request to response, tags for the HTTP request (status code, method, etc), error and stacktrace capturing, linking work created within a web request and Distributed Tracing.

*Note:* Many application servers are Servlet compatible and are automatically covered by that instrumentation, such as Tomcat, Jetty, Websphere, Weblogic, etc.
Also, frameworks like Spring Boot inherently work because it uses a Servlet compatible embedded application server.

## Trace Reporting

To report a trace to Datadog the following happens:

* Trace completes
* Trace is pushed to an asynchronous queue of traces
  * Queue is size-bound and doesn't grow past a set limit of 7000 traces
  * Once the size limit is reached, traces are discarded
  * A count of the total traces is captured to ensure accurate throughput
* In a separate reporting thread, the trace queue is flushed and traces are encoded via msgpack then sent to the Datadog Agent via http
* Queue flushing happens on a schedule of once per second

To see the actual code, documentation, and usage examples for any of the
libraries and frameworks that Datadog supports, check the full list of auto-
instrumented components for Java applications in the [Integrations](#integrations) section.

### Trace Annotation

Add the `dd-trace-api` dependency to your project. For Maven, add this to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.datadoghq</groupId>
    <artifactId>dd-trace-api</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, add:

```gradle
compile group: 'com.datadoghq', name: 'dd-trace-api', version: {version}
```

Now add `@Trace` to methods to have them be traced when running with `dd-java-agent.jar`.  If the Agent is not attached, this annotation has no effect on your application.

## JMX Metrics

Datadog's Java Tracer provides support for 'in-process' JMX metrics collection. This is enabled with `jmxfetch.enabled` configuration parameter. Additional JMX metrics are configured using configuration files that are passed to `jmxfetch.metrics-configs`. Contents of those configuration files are equivalent to contents of the `conf` section for external jmxfetch. See [JMX Integration][8] for further details on configuration.
By default, when JMX metrics collection is enabled it monitors JVM heap memory, thread count, and garbage collection. Use it in conjunction with APM for a broader view into your Java application's performance.

## Performance

Java APM has minimal impact on the overhead of an application:

* No collections maintained by Java APM grow unbounded in memory
* Reporting traces does not block the application thread
* Java APM typically adds no more than a 3% increase in CPU usage
* Java APM typically adds no more than a 3% increase in JVM heap usage
