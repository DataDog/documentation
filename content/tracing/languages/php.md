The APM tracer for PHP applications is in Open Public Beta.
</div>

## Installation and Getting Started

To begin tracing applications written in PHP, first [install and configure the Datadog Agent][1], see additional documentation for [tracing Docker applications][2] or [Kubernetes applications][3].

Next, install the Datadog PHP extension using one of the precompiled packages for supported distributions. The latest packages can be found on GitHub's [releases page][4]. If you don't find your distribution, you can install the PHP extension [from source][5]

```bash
# using RPM package (RHEL/Centos 6+, Fedora 20+)
rpm -ivh datadog-php-tracer.rpm

# using DEB package (Debian Jessie+ , Ubuntu 14.04+)
deb -i datadog-php-tracer.deb

# using APK package (Alpine)
apk add datadog-php-tracer.apk --allow-untrusted

# using tar.gz archive (Other distributions using libc6)
tar -xf datadog-php-tracer.tar.gz -C /
/opt/datadog-php/bin/post-install.sh
```

Finally, install the Datadog tracing library using composer:

```bash
composer config minimum-stability beta # required to install opentracing 1.0.0-beta5
composer require opentracing/opentracing
composer require datadog/dd-trace
```

**Note:** You can [install the Datadog library without changing minimum-stability][6]

## Compatibility

PHP APM includes support for the following PHP versions:

| Version | Support type |
| -----   | ------------ |
| 7.0.x   | Public Beta  |
| 7.1.x   | Public Beta  |
| 7.2.x   | Public Beta  |
| 5.6.x   | Public Beta  |

## Automatic Instrumentation

Automatic instrumentation uses the `ddtrace` extension to modify PHP's runtime and inject custom PHP code around specific methods. When [tracing is enabled][7] the PHP tracer is able to automatically instrument all supported libraries out of the box.

Automatic instrumentation captures:

* Method execution time.
* Relevant trace data, such as URL and status response codes for web requests or SQL queries for database access.
* Unhandled exceptions, including stacktraces if available.
* A total count of traces (e.g. web requests) flowing through the system.
