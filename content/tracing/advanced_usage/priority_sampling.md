title: Priority Sampling
kind: documentation
---

Priority Sampling allows traces between two Datadog endpoints to be sampled together. This prevents trace sampling from removing segments of a distributed trace. Additionally, APM traces expose sampling flags to configure how specific traces are sampled.

Distributed Traces may sample inconsistently when the linked traces run on different hosts. To ensure that distributed traces are complete, enable priority sampling. Priority sampling automatically assigns and propagates a priority value along all traces, depending on their service and volume. Priorities can also be set manually to drop non-interesting traces or keep important ones.

Priority sampling is disabled by default. To enable it, configure the `priority.sampling` flag to `true` ([see how to configure the client here](/tracing/setup/java/#configuration)).

Current Priority Values (more may be added in the future):

| Sampling Value | Effect                                                                                                     |
| --------       | :--------------------------------------------------                                                        |
| `SAMPLER_DROP` | The sampler automatically decided to not keep the trace. The Agent will drop it.                           |
| `SAMPLER_KEEP` | The sampler automatically decided to keep the trace. The Agent will keep it. Might be sampled server-side. |
| `USER_DROP`    | The user asked to not keep the trace. The Agent will drop it.                                              |
| `USER_KEEP`    | The user asked to keep the trace. The Agent will keep it. The server will keep it too.                     |

Manually set trace priority:
```java
import datadog.trace.api.Trace;
import datadog.trace.api.interceptor.MutableSpan;
import datadog.trace.common.sampling.PrioritySampling;
import io.opentracing.util.GlobalTracer;

public class MyClass {
    @Trace
    public static void myMethod() {
        // grab the active span out of the traced method
        MutableSpan ddspan = (MutableSpan) GlobalTracer.get().activeSpan();
        // ask the sampler to keep the current trace
        ddspan.setSamplingPriority(PrioritySampling.USER_KEEP);
        // method impl follows
    }
}
```

Propagate a single trace across multiple services with distributed tracing. For more details about how to use and configure distributed tracing, check out the [godoc page][tracer godoc].

Make use of priority sampling to ensure that distributed traces are complete. Set the sampling priority of a trace by adding the `sampling.priority` tag to its root span. This is then propagated throughout the entire stack. For example:

```go
span.SetTag(ext.SamplingPriority, ext.PriorityUserKeep)
```

Possible values for the sampling priority tag are:

| Sampling Value             | Effect                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ext.PriorityAutoReject     | The sampler automatically decided to not keep the trace. The Agent will drop it.                            |
| ext.PriorityAutoKeep       | The sampler automatically decided to keep the trace. The Agent will keep it. Might be sampled server-side.  |
| ext.PriorityUserReject     | The user asked to not keep the trace. The Agent will drop it.                                               |
| ext.PriorityUserKeep       | The user asked to keep the trace. The Agent will keep it. The server will keep it too.                      |
