## What is APM?

Datadog APM provides you with deep insight into your application's performance-from automatically generated dashboards monitoring key metrics, such as request volume and latency, to detailed traces of individual requests-side by side with your logs and infrastructure monitoring.

Datadog APM is offered as an upgrade to our Pro and Enterprise plans. A free 14-day trial is available. Registered users can visit the [APM page of the Datadog application][1] to get started.
