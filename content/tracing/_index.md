## What is APM?

Datadog APM provides you deep insight into your application's performance - from automatically generated dashboards monitoring key metrics such request volume and latency, to detailed traces of individual requests - side by side with your infrastructure monitoring.

Datadog APM is offered as an upgrade to our Pro and Enterprise plans. A free 14-day trial is available. Registered users can visit the [APM page of the Datadog application](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/home) to get started.

The APM agent (also known as _trace agent_) is shipped by default with the
Agent 6 in the Linux, MacOS and Windows packages. The APM agent is enabled by default on linux. To enable the check on other platforms or disable it on linux, update the `apm_config` key in your `datadog.yaml`:

```
apm_config:
  enabled: true
```

For the Docker image, the APM agent is disabled by default. Enable it by setting the `DD_APM_ENABLED` envvar to `true`. It then listen to all interfaces by default.

## Data collected

Datadog APM collects a variety of performance data at the service and endpoint level:

* Total request volume and rate
* Error volume and rate
* Latency (max, by percentile, overview of latency distribution)
* Apdex Score
* Distributed traces for individual transactions

## Terminology

In order to get the most from tracing, itâ€™s important to understand the terms used, the data they represent and how they work together:

|Term|Definition|Note|
|:----|:-----|:---|
|[service](/tracing/services/service)| Set of processes that do the same job.| Services are displayed on the [Datadog services list](/tracing/services) and have [out of the box performances graphs](/tracing/services/service/#out-of-the-box-graphs).|
|[resource](/tracing/services/resource)|Particular action for a service|Resources are available on the [resources list for each service](/tracing/services/service/#resources) and have [out of the box performances graphs](/tracing/services/resource/#out-of-the-box-graphs)|
|[trace](/tracing/services/trace)|Representation of a request as it flows across a distributed system| A trace can be collected in [any language](/tracing/setup). Traces are found in the [traces list for each resources](/tracing/services/resource/#traces) or in the [trace search directly](/tracing/traces)|
|[span](/tracing/services/trace/#spans) |A logical unit of work in the system| Spans are associated with a [service](/tracing/services/service) and optionally a [resource](/tracing/services/resource). Each span consists of a start time, a duration, and optional tags.|
