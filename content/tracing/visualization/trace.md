View an individual trace to see all of its spans and associated metadata. Each trace can be viewed either as a flame graph or as a list (grouped by service or host).

Calculate breakdown of execution time and adjust the color scheme by either **service** or **host**.

List sorts resources by service, not chronologically. Here it's easy to see all resources at a glance and sort by count of spans, average duration, and others:

If you are analyzing an error trace, the error has a specific display if you followed the [special meaning tags rules](#traces-special-meaning-tags):

### Traces special meaning tags

When [submitting your traces][1] you may add attributes in the `meta` parameter.  
Some of them have a special meaning which lead to a dedicated display and behavior in Datadog:

* **`sql.query`**:  
    Allows specific SQL query formating and display in Datadog UI.

* **`error.msg`**:  
    Allows dedicated display for error message.

* **`error.type`**:  
    Allows dedicated display for error types. Types available are for instance for python `ValueError` or `Exception` and for Java `ClassNotFoundException` or `NullPointerException`.

* **`error.stack`**:  
    Allows a better display of the Stacktrace of an exception in Datadog UI (red boxes etc...)
