## Getting Started

For descriptions of terminology used in APM, take a look at the [official documentation][visualization docs].

For details about configuration and using the API, check out our [API documentation][2].

For details about contributing, check out the [development guide][development docs].

### Requirements

Node `^4.7`, `^6.9` and `>=8` are supported by this library. However, it benefits significantly from the performance improvements introduced in Node `>=8.3`.

### Installation

To begin tracing Node.js applications, first [install and configure the Datadog Agent][1] (see additional documentation for [tracing Docker applications][3]).

Next, install the Datadog Tracing library using npm:

```sh
npm install --save dd-trace
```

Finally, import and initialize the tracer:

```js
// This line must come before importing any instrumented module.
const tracer = require('dd-trace').init()
```

See the [tracer settings][4] for the list of initialization options.

**Note**: The tracer must be initialized before importing any instrumented module.

## Tracer Settings

## Integrations

APM provides out-of-the-box instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries by using a plugin system.

For details about how to how to toggle and configure plugins, check out the [API documentation][6].

### Compatibility
