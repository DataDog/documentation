This documentation covers Agent v6 only, to know how to setup APM tracing with Agent v5, [refer to the dedicated APM with agent v5 doc](/tracing/faq/agent-5-tracing-setup)

## Setup process

With our infrastructure monitoring, metrics are sent to the Agent, which then forwards them to Datadog. Similarly, tracing metrics are also sent to the Agent: The application code instrumentation flushes to the Agent every 1 s ([see here for the Python client](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/blob/69693dc7cdaed3a2b6a855325109fa100e42e254/ddtrace/writer.py#L159) for instance) and the Agent flushes to the [Datadog API every 10s](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/blob/master/config/agent.go#L170).  

To start tracing your application:

1. **Install the Datadog Agent**:    
  Install and configure the latest [Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) (version 6.0 or above is required). For additional information, reference the [getting started guide](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/tree/master/config#agent-configuration).

2. **Install the Trace Agent**:  

  * On **Linux**,**Windows**, and **[Docker](/tracing/setup/docker)** the Trace Agent is pre-packaged with the standard Datadog Agent and no extra configuration is needed.

  * On **macOS** , install and run the [Trace Agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent) in addition to the Datadog Agent.  
  See the [macOS Trace Agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent#run-on-osx) and [Windows Trace Agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/#run-on-windows) dedicated documentation.  

  * On Heroku, Deploy the Datadog Trace Agent via the [Datadog Heroku Buildpack](https://github.com/DataDog/heroku-buildpack-datadog).  

3. **Configure your environment**:  
  An environment is a first class dimension used to scope a whole Datadog APM application. A common use case is to disaggregate metrics from stage environments such as production, staging, and pre-production. [Learn how to configure environments](/tracing/setup/environment).  
  **Note**: if you do not configure your own environments, all data will default to `env:none`.

4. **Instrument your application**:   
  Select one of the following supported languages:

  - [Go](/tracing/setup/go)
  - [Java](/tracing/setup/java)
  - [Python](/tracing/setup/python)
  - [Ruby](/tracing/setup/ruby)

    To instrument an application written in a language that does not yet have official library support, reference the [Tracing API](/api/?lang=console#traces), or visit our list of [community tracing libraries](/developers/libraries/#community-tracing-apm-libraries).

## Agent configuration

The APM agent (also known as _trace agent_) is shipped by default with the
Agent 6 in the Linux, MacOS and Windows packages. The APM agent is enabled by default on linux. To enable the check on other platforms or disable it on linux, update the `apm_config` key in your `datadog.yaml`:

```
apm_config:
  enabled: true
```

For the Docker image, the APM agent is disabled by default. Enable it by setting the `DD_APM_ENABLED` envvar to `true`. It then listen to all interfaces by default.  

If you want to listen to non-local trafic on any other platform, set
`apm_config.apm_non_local_traffic = true` in your `datadog.yaml`.

## Example: Simple tracing

We have a Flask Python application that when called on `/doc` returns **42**

We instrumented our python code in order to generate traces from it:

```python
import time
import blinker as _

from flask import Flask, Response

from ddtrace import tracer
from ddtrace.contrib.flask import TraceMiddleware

# Tracer configuration
tracer.configure(hostname='datadog')
app = Flask('API')
traced_app = TraceMiddleware(app, tracer, service='doc_service')

@tracer.wrap(name='doc_work')
def work():
    time.sleep(0.5)
    return 42

@app.route('/doc/')
def doc_resource():
    time.sleep(0.3)
    res = work()
    time.sleep(0.3)
    return Response(str(res), mimetype='application/json')
```

Each time its called, the following code produces this **trace**:
