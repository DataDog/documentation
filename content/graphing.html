Here is a short primer to our graphing language.

## Grammar ## {#grammar}

The graph definition language is well-formed JSON and is structured in 2 parts:

1. Events
2. Time Series, a.k.a. Series

Here is how they fit together in a JSON dictionary:

    {
      "requests": [
        {
          "q": "metric{scope}"
        }
      ],
      "events": [
        {
          "q": "searchq query"
        }
      ]
    }

In other words at the highest level the JSON structure is a dictionary with 2 entries:

1. "events"
2. "requests"

### Events

You can overlay any event from Datadog. The general format is:

    "events": "search query"

For instance to indicate that you want events for machine X and tag Y:

    "events": "host:X tags:Y"


### Scope

A scope lets you define what a time series or an event applies to. It
can be a host, a device on a host or any arbitrary tag you can think
of that contains only alphanumeric characters plus colons and
underscores (`[a-zA-Z1-9:_]+`).

Examples of scope (meaning in parenthesis):

    host:my_host                      (related to a given host)
    host:my_host, device:my_device    (related to a given device on a given host)
    source:my_source                  (related to a given source)
    my_tag                            (related to a tagged group of hosts)
    my:tag                            (same)
    *                                 (wildcard for everything)

### Series

The general format of a Series is:

    function(metric{scope} [by {group}])

The `function` and `group` are optional.

Series can be further combined together via binary operators (+, -, /, *):

    metric{scope} [by {group}] operator metric{scope} [by {group}]

Series are represented in 2 representatinos:

1. as line charts
2. as stacked areas
3. as slice-n-stack areas

#### Line Charts

The representation is automatically derived from the `requests` value.

    "requests": [
        {
          "q": "metric1{scope}"
        },
        {
          "q": "metric2{scope}"
        },
        {
          "q": "metric3{scope}"
        }
      ]

#### Stacked Series

In the case of related time series you can easily draw them as stacked areas by using the following syntax:

    "requests": [
        {
          "q": "metric1{scope}, metric2{scope}, metric3{scope}"
        }
    ]

Instead of one query per chart you aggregate all queries into one and simply concatenate the queries.

#### Slice-n-Stack

Another common visualization is to represent a metric shared across
hosts and stack the results. For instance when selecting a tag that
applies to more than 1 host you will see that ingress and egress
traffic is nicely stacked to give you the sum as well as the split per
host. Useful to spot wild swings in the distribution of network
traffic.

Here's how to do it for any metric:

    "requests" [
      {
         "q": "system.net.bytes_rcvd{some_tag, device:eth0} by {host}"
      }
    ]

Note that in this case you can only have 1 query. But you can also split by device, or a combination of both:

    "requests" [
      {
         "q": "system.net.bytes_rcvd{some_tag} by {host,device}"
      }
    ]

to get traffic for all the tagged hosts, split by host and network device.

## Arithmetic and Functions ## {#functions}

Series also support simple arithmetic and a number of functions.

You can apply functions to metric queries in the graph editor, as long as you
use the JSON editor.

### Arithmetic

You can apply simple arithmetic to Series (+, -, * and /). In this
example we graph 5-minute load and its double.

    {
      "viz": "timeseries",
      "requests": [
        {
          "q": "system.load.5{intake} * 2"
        },
        {
          "q": "system.load.5{intake}"
        }
      ]
    }

You can also add, substract, multiply and divide series. Beware that
Datadog does not enforce consistency at this point so you *can* divide
apples by oranges.

    {
        "viz": "timeseries",
        "requests": [
          {
            "q": "metric{apples} / metric{oranges}"
          }
        ]
    }

### Functions

You can apply functions to the result of each query.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>dt()</td>
    <td>time delta between points</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>diff()</td>
    <td>value delta between points</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>derivative()</td>
    <td>1st order derivative, diff / dt</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>rate()</td>
    <td>1st order derivate that skips non-monotonically increasing values</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>derived()</td>
    <td>synonym for derivative</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>per_second()</td>
    <td>synonym for rate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>per_minute()</td>
    <td>60 * rate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>per_hour()</td>
    <td>3600 * rate</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>avg_5min()</td>
    <td>average over past 5 minutes</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>avg_10min()</td>
    <td>average over past 10 minutes</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>avg_30min()</td>
    <td>average over past 30 minutes</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>avg_hourly()</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>avg_daily()</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ewma_3()</td>
    <td>exponentially-moving weighted average with a span of 3</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ewma_5()</td>
    <td>... with a span of 5</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ewma_10()</td>
    <td>... with a span of 10</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ewma_20()</td>
    <td>... with a span of 20</td>
  </tr>
</table>
