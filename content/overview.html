So, you've just finished [installing](/guides/basic_agent_usage/) the Datadog 
Agent, or maybe you're just curious about [what (else) Datadog can do for you](http://www.datadoghq.com/product/).
This document gives a high level overview of Datadog's capabilities and how 
it can help you bring your infrastructure to heel.

<h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

<img src="/static/images/integrations.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

<ul>
<li>40+ integrations <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datadoghq.com/integrations/">officially listed</a>, 
always adding more.</li>
<li>Custom integrations are available <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/api/">via our API</a>, 
many documented by our active user community.</li>
<li>The Agent is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/">open source</a> and you 
can instrument your own if you'd like.</li>
<li>Once integrations have been configured, data living in a datacenter or 
in an online service is treated the same throughout Datadog.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<img src="/static/images/infrastructure.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

<ul>
<li>All machines show up in the infrastructure overview</li>
<li>Here you can see the tags applied to each machine; as they're assigned to 
perform certain roles, tagging allows you to indicate machines have 
a certain purpose</li>
<li>We do as much as possible to automatically categorize your servers 
for you, to create structure in your infrastructure with as little 
work as possible (unlike explicitly creating all your clusters). 
Thus if a new machine is tagged, you can immediately see the stats 
for that machine based on what was previously set up for that tag.</li>
<li>For more on tagging, please see <a target="_blank" href="/faq/#tagging">here</a>.

</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="events">Events</h2>

<img src="/static/images/event_stream.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

The Event Stream is based on the same conventions as a blog
<ul>
<li>Every event in the stream can be commented on.</li>
<li>Great for distributed <a target="_blank" href="/faq/#team">teams</a> and maintaining the focus of an investigation</li>
<li>You can filter by: user, source, tag, host, status, priority, incident</li>
</ul>

<img src="/static/images/event_stream_post_incident_history.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

For each incident users can:
<ul>
<li>Claim it</li>
<li>Increase/decrease priority</li>
<li>Comment</li>
<li>See similar incidents </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="/faq/#notify">@ notify team members</a>, who receive an email</li>
<li>@support to ask for assistance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dashboards">Dashboards</h2>

<img src="/static/images/dashboard_events.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

Dashboards contain <a target="_blank" href="/graphing/">graphs</a> with real-time performance metrics
<ul>
<li>Synchronous mousing across all graphs in a dashboard.	</li>
<li>Vertical bars are events in the context of the metric.</li>
<li>Click & drag on a graph to zoom-in on a particular time-frame.</li>
<li>As you hover over the graph the event stream moves with you.</li>
<li>Display by zone, host, or total usage.</li>
<li>Share a graph snapshot that will appear in the stream; clicking on 
that snapshot returns you to the original dashboard (via the camera in the upper right of a graph).</li>
<li>Graphs can be embedded in an iframe, giving a 3rd party a live graph 
without access to your data or any other information (via the cog in the upper right of a graph).</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="alerting">Alerting</h2>
<img src="/static/images/alert.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

Alerting gives you the ability to be notified if the aggregate of a specific 
metric is above or below a certain threshold:
<ul>
<li>Across your entire infrastructure</li>
<li>Per machine (average, max, min, or sum) </li>
<li>Applies to any metric you want, revenue: data center temperature, etc.</li>
<li>Multi alerts (by device, host, etc.)</li>
<li>Set alert notification message, including @ capabilities</li>
</ul>

Does the data have to be pushed to Datadog?
<ol>
Currently, yes:
<li>All integrations we have get data flowing almost automatically after 
launching the Agent (intial reporting may take a few minutes, but not longer than 10).</li>
<li>If you have custom metrics, you can indicate specifically where 
to pull the data from.</li>
</ol>
