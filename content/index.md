**Not sure where to look?** Our documentation is split into guides and references. Guides explain how to
accomplish a particular task with Datadog, while the references are more general (as you might expect).
It might be a good idea to start with the [Datadog Overview][4], which explains Datadog's
capabilities at a high level.

**Search for it!** If you know roughly what you are looking for, enter it in the search box on the top left of the sidebar.

**If you have questions, we're here to help.** You can get in touch with
our support team by mentioning [@support-datadog][5] in a comment on Datadog itself, or by
[email][6], on [Slack][7], or on our [customer service site][8].

**Find a mistake in this documentation?** [Let us know on GitHub][9]
and we'll take care of it.
