We offer reporting in a variety of ways so far, which include:

* The ability to embed any chart anywhere. Pick a graph on a dashboard, click on the pencil to edit it and you’ll find the “share” tab that will generate an IFRAME.
* For certain sources (e.g. pagerduty), you’ll get a report in your mailbox once a week to go over past alerts.
* Metric alerts provide a way to report changes that are outside of what you define as “normal”.
