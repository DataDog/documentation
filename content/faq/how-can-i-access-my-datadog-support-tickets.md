First you need to have opened at least one ticket to support@datadoghq.com 

If you already emailed us, you need to get a password from us by clicking this link on the sign in page of this website : `https://help.datadoghq.com`


{{< img src="faq/sing_in.png" alt="sing in" responsive="true" >}}

Once you received the password, when you log in, you should be then directed to this location: `https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/requests`

From here, you should be able to see your requests:
{{< img src="faq/my_activities.png" alt="my activities" responsive="true" >}}


However, if you don't see this after logging in, you can click on your name in the upper righthand corner, and then select "My Activities" from there. 

Feel free to [reach out to our support team](/help) directly if you encounter any issue!
