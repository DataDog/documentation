To reset your Datadog API keys do the following:
 
1. It isn't possible to have zero API keys so before revoking your key(s) you'll first need to create a new one. Simply go to the Integration -> APIs page and select "Create API key" (located at the bottom of the page):
    *  https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api
2. Once a new key has been added simply select "Revoke" to remove each of your old keys.

Once you've revoked your keys you'll need to update the datadog.conf file on each of your agents with this new key. To do so:
 
1. On the Integration -> APIs page, create and copy a new API key.
 
2. You'll need to navigate to your host's Datadog agent conf file:
    * Linux: /etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf
    * Windows: C:\ProgramData\Datadog\datadog.conf
    * Other OS's [reference this link](/agent/faq/where-is-the-configuration-file-for-the-agent)

3. In your conf file, replace the API key. It should look like this (leave a single space after the ":" character. Do NOT surround your key with quotations):
    * https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/datadog.conf.example#L22

4. Once done, [restart the agent](/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent):
    * Linux: sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent restart
    * Windows: Restart the Datadog Service
    * Other OS's [reference this link](/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent)
If you're using a configuration management tool such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible we suggest following the instructions [found here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) for setting the API keys.
