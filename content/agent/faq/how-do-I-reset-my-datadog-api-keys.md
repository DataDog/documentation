To reset your Datadog API keys do the following:  

1. It isn't possible to have zero API keys so before revoking your key(s) you'll first need to create a new one. Go to the Integration -> APIs page and select "Create API key" (located at the bottom of the page):
    *  https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api
2. Once a new key has been added, select "Revoke" to remove each of your old keys.

Once you've revoked your keys, update the `datadog.conf` file on each of your agents with this new key. To do so:

1. On the [Integration -> APIs page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api), create and copy a new API key.
 
2. Navigate to your host's Datadog agent configuration file:
    * Linux: /etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf
    * Windows: C:\ProgramData\Datadog\datadog.conf
    * Other OS's [reference this link](/agent/#configuration-file)

3. In your configuration file, replace the API key. It should look like this (leave a single space after the ":" character. Do NOT surround your key with quotations):
    * https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/datadog.conf.example#L22

4. Once done, [restart the agent](/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent):
    * Linux: ```sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent restart```
    * Windows: Restart the Datadog Service
    * Other OS's [reference this link](/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent)

If you're using a configuration management tool such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible we suggest following the instructions [found here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) for setting the API keys. If you need additional assistance reach out to [us](/help).
