If your Datadog account was disabled and then re-enabled your API key was likely reset, to confirm/reset this please do the following:
 
1. Go to the Integration->API's page and copy the key listed at the top: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api
 
2. Log into your host(s) and navigate to the Datadog agent's conf:
    * Linux: `/etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf`
    * Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Datadog\datadog.conf`
    * Other OS's reference [this link](/agent/faq/where-is-the-configuration-file-for-the-agent)
3. In your config, replace/update the API key, it should look like this:
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/datadog.conf.example#L22
4. Once done, restart the agent:
    * Linux: `sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent start`
    * Windows: `Recycle the Datadog Service`
    * Other OS's reference [this link](/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent)
