For Windows, it's important that the original account used to install the Agent is also used to remove it, otherwise it's possible remnants will be left behind and it will not be cleanly removed.

Uninstall the Agent using Add/Remove Programs, alternatively, it's possible to to use Powershell as well. Here is a one liner:

```
(Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product -Filter "Name='Datadog Agent'" -ComputerName . ).Uninstall()
