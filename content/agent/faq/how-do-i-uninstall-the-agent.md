## Agent v6
### Amazon Linux/Debian/Fedora/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get --purge remove datadog-agent -y
```

* For CentOS 5:

    ```
    sudo yum remove datadog-agent-base
    ```

* For CentOS 6:

    ```

    ```

### Mac OS

Stop and close the Datadog Agent: via the bone icon in the Tray.

Drag the Datadog Application from the application folder to the Trash Bin.

```
sudo rm -rf /opt/datadog-agent
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/datadog-agent
sudo rm -rf ~/.datadog-agent/**​ #to remove broken symlinks
```
If you ran the optional install commands to have the Agent run at boot time, run the following to finish uninstalling:

```
sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.datadoghq.agent.plist
sudo  rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.datadoghq.agent.plist
```

sudo yum remove datadog-agent
```

### Windows

For Windows, it's important that the original account used to install the Agent is also used to remove it, otherwise it’s possible remnants will be left behind and it will not be cleanly removed.

```
(Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product -Filter "Name='Datadog Agent'" -ComputerName . ).Uninstall()
