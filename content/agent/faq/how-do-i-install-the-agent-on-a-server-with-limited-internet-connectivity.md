The setup script provided in the in application Agent install instructions requires outbound https access to a number of different endpoints in order to function properly and might not work well with servers that have limited Internet access.

For servers with no direct Internet access, the Agent can be configured to route through a proxy. [Refer to the help article on this topic][1]

For servers with limited outbound Internet connectivity, the Agent can be installed using the relevant package for the server's OS. The in application install instructions contain instructions for this approach which can be viewed by clicking the link shown on the instructions page.

If the target system is blocked from accessing the package repository directly, download the package from the repository using another server then transfer it over to the target system for a local install.

The example below shows a user copying the [URL to the rpm package][2] for the latest version of the Agent :

**Note**: The package bundles all resources necessary to run our Agent and our checks (whether the integration is enabled or not). In terms of hard requirements, python 2.7+ and sysstat are required; other dependencies are mandatory depending on what checks are enabled.

Once the package has been transferred to the target system, it can be installed locally by using the appropriate package manager command.

For yum, using Agent 5.7.3 as an example, the command would be:
sudo yum localinstall datadog-agent-5.7.3-1.x86_64.rpm

Once installed, the `datadog.yaml` file needs to be generated from the `datadog.yaml.example` file and updated with the API key for your instance.

This can be done with a single command:
```
sudo sh -c "sed 's/api_key:.*/api_key: <API_KEY>/' /etc/dd-agent/datadog.yaml.example > /etc/dd-agent/datadog.yaml"
```

Run the command above after replacing `<API_KEY>` with [the API KEY for your Organization][3]

Next, start the Agent:

```
sudo service datadog-agent start
```
