* No, it is not. You don't have to install an agent if you only want to submit
metrics via our API. You can read more about our API [here](/api/).
* In general, most folks find a lot of value in installing an agent because
they get system metrics for free and metrics on common software like mysql,
postgres, etc. with just a little bit of configuration. Another advantage is
that there is a small statsd server built-in to the agent.
