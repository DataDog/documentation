### Infos

Running an info command displays the status of your Datadog agent, and the status of all integrations enabled for this Agent:

An Agent integration reports “OK” if it's properly configured as seen below:

```
  Checks
  ======

    network
    -------
      - instance #0 [OK]
      - Collected 15 metrics, 0 events & 1 service check
```

The `[OK]` in the Agent output implies that the check was configured/run correctly but does not refer to the value being returned by your check.  

### Mac OS X

```

```

It's also possible to run the info command using Powershell:

```
"C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\python.exe" "C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\agent\agent.py" info
```
or cmd.exe:
```
C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\embedded\python.exe" "C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog Agent\agent\agent.py" info
```

If you're running on a version older than 5.2 visit the status page in your web browser:

http://localhost:17125/status
The status page is supported in Agent version 3.9.1-5.1.1
