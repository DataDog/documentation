## What is the Agent?

The Datadog Agent is a piece of software that runs on your hosts. Its job is to faithfully collect events and metrics and bring them to Datadog on
your behalf so that you can do something useful with your monitoring and performance data.

[The source code for the Datadog Agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent).

For information on running the Agent through a proxy, see [the dedicated documentation Datadog Agent and proxy ](/agent/proxy); for which IP ranges to allow, see [the complete list of IP's and ports](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Network-Traffic-and-Proxy-Configuration#open-ports).

The Agent has three main parts: the collector, DogStatsD, and the forwarder:

* **The collector**: runs checks on the current machine for whatever [integrations](/integrations) you have and it captures system metrics such as memory and CPU.

* **DogStatsD**: It is a statsd backend server you can send [custom metrics](/getting_started/custom_metrics/) to from an application.

* **The forwarder**: retrieves data from both DogStatsD and the collector and then queues it up to be sent to Datadog.

This is all controlled by one supervisor process. We keep this separate so you don't have to have the overhead of each application if you don't want to run all parts, although we generally recommend you do.

## Configuration management tools

Manage the Datadog agent and [integrations](/integrations) using configuration management tools:

### Chef
* [Chef Github project](https://github.com/DataDog/chef-datadog)
* [Chef installation](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/chef)
* [Chef documentation](/integrations/chef)

### Puppet
* [Puppet Github project](https://github.com/DataDog/puppet-datadog-agent)
* [Puppet installation](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/puppet)
* [Puppet documentation](/integrations/puppet)

### Ansible
* [Ansible Github project](https://github.com/DataDog/ansible-datadog)
* [Ansible installation](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/ansible)
* [Ansible documentation](/integrations/ansible/)

Chef, Puppet, and Ansible [integrations](/integrations) using our public APIs so if you're interested in using another automation tool, the above could be leveraged as examples to get you started.

There is also community support for Saltstack:

## Agent Troubleshooting

If you ended up at this page and have not yet installed the Datadog Agent, go [to the dedicated agent integration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) for installation instructions. If you just installed the Agent, it might take a few moments before you start seeing metrics appear. The first place you should check for metrics is the [Metrics Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/explorer).

If you think you might be experiencing issues, the first thing to do is [run the info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) and check the [Agent logs](/agent/faq/log-locations). The [info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) and the log locations are dependent on your OS, which you can select from the navigation to the left for further information.

### Issues getting the Agent installed

If you encountered an issue during the Agent installation process that prevented installation from occurring, reach out to [Datadog support team](/help). Let us know your OS and version, as well as how you are installing the Agent. You should include any error messages you encountered along the way.

### Issues getting the Agent reporting

If you get the Agent installed but are not seeing any data in Datadog, you can troubleshoot in the following manner.
First, [run the info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information). Select your OS in the navigation column on the left of this page to see how to run this. Does running the [info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) show any errors?

If not, you should also check the logs (location of the logs again depends on OS). Errors in the logs may also reveal the cause of any issues.

If not, send both the full output of the [info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) and the logs with a flare as attachments to the [Datadog support team](mailto:support@datadoghq.com?Subject=Agent%20issues).

#### Check your machine's time
We have also seen a few cases where machines have their clock set further in the future or the past, which can sometimes cause problems with metric submission.
To check for this, run:

```shell
date -u && curl -s -v https://app.datadoghq.com 2>&1 | grep Date
```
This outputs the current system’s date, and then makes a request to our endpoint and grabs the date on our end.
If these are more than a few minutes apart, you should correct the time settings on your server.

### Issues getting integrations working

Datadog has many [integrations](/integrations/) which are set up through [YAML files in the Agent](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/tree/master/conf.d).

Here is a quick guide for troubleshooting [integrations](/integrations) installation:

1. [Run the info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information).

2. Is the integration showing up in the [info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information)?

* **No, it's not**:
    * Check the configuration file, make sure it is in the right location and named correctly.
    * Check it in a YAML parser to make sure it has the correct syntax. [Example files](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/tree/master/conf.d).
    * If you moved or changed the file, [restart the Agent](/agent/faq/start-stop-restart-the-datadog-agent) and rerun the [info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) to see if it is now showing up.

*  **Yes, it's there**:
    * Check the [Metrics Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/explorer) to see if system metrics are showing up from the host. For example, look for `system.cpu.user` from the host that is running the Agent and has that integration setup.
    * If there are still no metrics, check the logs for errors and send them along with the [info command](/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information) output, to [the Datadog support team](mailto:support@datadoghq.com?Subject=Agent%20issues).
