## What is the Agent?

The Datadog Agent is a piece of software that runs on your hosts. Its job is to faithfully collect events and metrics and bring them to Datadog on your behalf so that you can do something useful with your monitoring and performance data. The Datadog Agent is open source, view the source code on GitHub for [Agent v5][1] and [Agent v6][2]. To see all changes between Agent v5 and v6, [consult our dedicated changes documentation][3].

{{< partial name="platforms/platforms.html" >}}

The Agent has three main parts: the collector, DogStatsD, and the forwarder:

* **Collector**: Runs checks on the current machine for whatever [integrations][4] you have, and captures system metrics such as memory and CPU.
* **DogStatsD**: A StatsD-compatible backend server that you can send [custom metrics][5] to from your own applications.
* **Forwarder**: Retrieves data from both DogStatsD and the collector, and then queues it up to be sent to Datadog.

This is all controlled by one supervisor process. We keep this separate so you don't have to deal with the overhead of each application if you don't want to run all parts (although we generally recommend that you do).

## What is the Agent v6?

Agent 6 is the latest major version of the Datadog Agent. The big difference between Agent 5 and Agent 6 is that Agent 6 is a complete rewrite of the core Agent in Golang. Golang has allowed us to take advantage of concurrency. In place of the three processes the Agent v5 used to run --*the Forwarder*, *the Collector*, and *DogStatsD*-- there is now only one process: the Agent. It also comes with a number of other core improvements:

* Agent v6 has significantly improved resource usage over Agent v5:
  * It has decreased CPU usage
  * It has decrease memory usage
  * It uses fewer file descriptors
  * It has an all around decreased footprint

* [Distributions metrics][17] can be performed on the server directly to calculate real, effective global percentiles. (NOTE: this feature is currently in BETA. Contact support for details on how to have it enabled for your account.)

* [DogStatsD][6] can be used over a Unix socket instead of over udp.

* Custom build your Agent v6 and [DogStatsD][6] much easier and with much more configuration options, to include or exclude almost anything. There is also a "puppy" Agent, which is a truly minimal installation.

* Agent 6 uses ports `5000` and `5001` by default. You can specify different ports for `expvar_port` and `cmd_port` in the `datadog.yaml` file.

## Agent configuration files migration

To automatically transition Agent configuration paths and formats from Agent v5 to Agent v6, use the `import` command:

`sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent import`

The command parses an existing v5 `datadog.conf` and converts the configuration options to the new v6 `datadog.yaml` format. It also copies configuration files for checks that are currently enabled.

For Mac and Windows environments, use:

`datadog-agent import <old_configuration_dir> <destination_dir>`

With:

* `<old_configuration_dir>` is the directory containing the `datadog.conf` file
* `<destination_dir>` is the directory where the imported `datadog.yaml` is written (use the same directory as `<old_configuration_dir>` on both Mac & Windows environment).

**Note**: On Windows, `datadog.conf` is automatically upgraded to `datadog.yaml` on upgrade.

## Resource overhead

### Agent v6
* CPU: \~ 0.12% of the CPU used on average
* Memory: \~ 55Mo of RAM used
* Network bandwidth: \~ 86 B/s &#9660; | 260 B/s &#9650;

### Agent v5
* CPU: \~ 0.35% of the CPU used on average
* Memory: \~ 115Mo of RAM used
* Network bandwidth: \~ 1900 B/s &#9660; | 800 B/s &#9650;
* Disk: Linux 120MB | Windows 60MB

Caveats:

* Enabling integrations may increase the Agent's resource consumption.
* Enabling JVM checks forces the Agent to use more memory, depending on the number of beans exposed by the monitored JVMs.
* Enabling the trace/process/logging Agents may increase resource consumption.

## CLI

The new command line interface for the Agent is sub-command based:

| Command         | Notes                                                                      |

| start           | Start the Agent                                                            |
| start-service   | Starts the Agent within the service control manager                        |
| status          | Print the current status                                                   |

To run a sub-command, the Agent binary must be invoked like this:
```
<path_to_agent_bin> <sub_command> <options>
```

Some options have their own set of flags and options detailed in a help message. For example, to see how to use the `check` sub-command, run:
```
<agent_binary> check --help
```

## Using the GUI

The port which the GUI runs on can be configured in your `datadog.yaml` file. Setting the port to `-1` disables the GUI all together. By default it is enabled on port `5002` on Windows and Mac, and is disabled on Linux.

Once the Agent is running, use the `datadog-agent launch-gui` command to launch the GUI within your default web browser.

**Note**: The agent GUI isn't supported on 32-bit Windows platforms.

### Requirements

1. Cookies must be enabled in your browser. The GUI generates and saves a token in your browser which is used for authenticating all communications with the GUI server.

2. The GUI will only be launched if the user launching it has the correct user permissions. If you are able to open `datadog.yaml`, you are able to use the GUI.

3. For security reasons, the GUI can **only** be accessed from the local network interface (```localhost```/```127.0.0.1```), so you must be on the same host that the Agent is running to use it. In other words, you can't run the Agent on a VM or a container and access it from the host machine.
