## What is the Agent?

The Datadog Agent is a piece of software that runs on your hosts. Its job is to faithfully collect events and metrics and bring them to Datadog on your behalf so that you can do something useful with your monitoring and performance data. The Datadog Agent is open source: view the source code on GitHub for [Agent v6][2].

{{< partial name="platforms/platforms.html" >}}

The Agent has three main parts: the collector, DogStatsD, and the forwarder:

* **Collector**: Runs checks on the current machine for whatever [integrations][4] you have, and captures system metrics such as memory and CPU.
* **DogStatsD**: A StatsD-compatible backend server that you can send [custom metrics][5] to from your own applications.
* **Forwarder**: Retrieves data from both DogStatsD and the collector, and then queues it up to be sent to Datadog.

## CLI

The new command line interface for the Agent v6 is sub-command based:

| Command           | Notes                                                                      |

| `configcheck`     | Print all configurations loaded & resolved of a running Agent              |
| `diagnose`        | Execute some connectivity diagnosis on your system                         |
| `flare`           | Collect a flare and send it to Datadog                                     |
| `health`          | Print the current Agent health                                             |

| `hostname`        | Print the hostname used by the Agent                                       |
| `import`          | Import and convert configuration files from previous versions of the Agent |
| `installservice`  | Installs the Agent within the service control manager                      |
| `launch-gui`      | Starts the Datadog Agent GUI                                               |
| `regimport`       | Import the registry settings into datadog.yaml                             |
| `remove-service`  | Removes the Agent from the service control manager                         |
| `restart-service` | Restarts the Agent within the service control manager                      |
| `start`           | Start the Agent                                                            |
| `start-service`   | Starts the Agent within the service control manager                        |
| `status`          | Print the current status                                                   |
| `stopservice`     | Stops the Agent within the service control manager                         |
| `version`         | Print the version info                                                     |


To run a sub-command, the Agent binary must be invoked like this:
```
<path_to_agent_bin> <sub_command> <options>
```

Some options have their own set of flags and options detailed in a help message. For example, to see how to use the `check` sub-command, run:
```
<agent_binary> check --help
```

## Using the GUI

The port which the GUI runs on can be configured in your `datadog.yaml` file. Setting the port to `-1` disables the GUI all together. By default it is enabled on port `5002` on Windows and Mac, and is disabled on Linux.

Once the Agent is running, use the `datadog-agent launch-gui` command to launch the GUI within your default web browser.

**Note**: The Agent GUI isn't supported on 32-bit Windows platforms.

### Requirements

1. Cookies must be enabled in your browser. The GUI generates and saves a token in your browser which is used for authenticating all communications with the GUI server.

2. The GUI will only be launched if the user launching it has the correct user permissions. If you are able to open `datadog.yaml`, you are able to use the GUI.

3. For security reasons, the GUI can **only** be accessed from the local network interface (```localhost```/```127.0.0.1```), so you must be on the same host that the Agent is running to use it. In other words, you can't run the Agent on a VM or a container and access it from the host machine.
