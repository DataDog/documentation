## What is the Agent?

The Datadog Agent is software that runs on your hosts. It collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog, where you can analyze your monitoring and performance data. The Datadog Agent is open-source, and its source code is available on GitHub at [DataDog/datadog-agent][2].

{{< partial name="platforms/platforms.html" >}}

The Agent has three main parts: the **collector**, **DogStatsD**, and the **forwarder**:

* **Collector**: It runs checks on the current machine for configured [integrations][4], and captures system metrics, such as memory and CPU.
* **DogStatsD**: It is a StatsD-compatible backend server that you can send [custom metrics][5] to from your applications.
* **Forwarder**: It retrieves data from both DogStatsD and the collector, queues it up, and then sends it to Datadog.

## CLI

The new command line interface for the Agent v6 is sub-command based:

| Command           | Notes                                                                      |

| `hostname`        | Print the hostname used by the Agent                                       |
| `import`          | Import and convert configuration files from previous versions of the Agent |

| `remove-service`  | Removes the Agent from the service control manager                         |
| `restart-service` | Restarts the Agent within the service control manager                      |
| `start`           | Start the Agent                                                            |
| `start-service`   | Starts the Agent within the service control manager                        |
| `status`          | Print the current status                                                   |

To run a sub-command, first invoke the Agent binary.
```
<path_to_agent_bin> <sub_command> <options>
```

Some options have their own set of flags and options detailed in a help message. For example, to see how to use the `check` sub-command, run:
```
<agent_binary> check --help
```

## GUI

You can configure the port on which the GUI runs in the `datadog.yaml` file. To disable the GUI, set the port's value to `-1`.
For Windows and macOS, the GUI is enabled by default and runs on port `5002`. For Linux, the GUI is disabled by default.

When the Agent is running, use the `datadog-agent launch-gui` command to open the GUI in your default web browser.

**Note**: The Agent GUI isn't supported on 32-bit Windows platforms.

### Requirements

1. Cookies must be enabled in your browser. The GUI generates and saves a token in your browser which is used for authenticating all communications with the GUI server.

2. To start the GUI, the user must have the required permissions. If you are able to open `datadog.yaml`, you are able to use the GUI.

3. For security reasons, the GUI can **only** be accessed from the local network interface (```localhost```/```127.0.0.1```), therefore you must be on the same host that the Agent is running. That is, you can't run the Agent on a VM or a container and access it from the host machine.
