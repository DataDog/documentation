## Overview

This page outlines the basic features of the Datadog Agent.
If you haven't installed the Agent yet, instructions can be found
[in the Datadog Agent integration page][1].

The process to upgrade from the previous version of the Agent is to re-run the installation.

## Commands

Datadog Agent has some commands and only the _lifecycle commands_ (i.e. `start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status` on the Agent service) should be run with `sudo service`/`sudo systemctl`, all other commands need to be run with the `datadog-agent` command.

| Agent v5                                          | Agent v6                                               | Notes                              |
| -----------------------------------------------   | ---------------------------------------                | -----------------------------      |
| `sudo service datadog-agent start`                | `sudo service datadog-agent start`                     | Start Agent as a service           |
| `sudo service datadog-agent stop`                 | `sudo service datadog-agent stop`                      | Stop Agent running as a service    |
| `sudo service datadog-agent restart`              | `sudo service datadog-agent restart`                   | Restart Agent running as a service |
| `sudo service datadog-agent status`               | `sudo service datadog-agent status`                    | Status of Agent service            |
| `sudo service datadog-agent info`                 | `sudo datadog-agent status`                            | Status page of running Agent       |
| `sudo service datadog-agent flare`                | `sudo datadog-agent flare`                             | Send flare                         |
| `sudo service datadog-agent`                      | `sudo datadog-agent --help`                            | Display command usage              |
| `sudo -u dd-agent -- dd-agent check <check_name>` | `sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent check <check_name>` | Run a check                        |

More information about the metrics, events, and service checks for an [integrations][2] can be retrieved with the check command:
```shell
sudo service datadog-agent check [integration]
```

Add the check_rate argument to get the most recent values for rates:
```shell
sudo service datadog-agent check [integration] check_rate
```

**NB**: If `service` is not available on your system, use:

* on `systemd`-based systems: `sudo systemctl start/stop/restart datadog-agent`

## Configuration

The configuration files and folders for the Agent are located at:

| Agent v5                     | Agent v6                          |
| :-----                       | :----                             |
| `/etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf` | `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml` |

Configuration files for [integrations][2]:

| Agent v5                | Agent v6                     |
| :-----                  | :----                        |
| `/etc/dd-agent/conf.d/` | `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/` |

## Upgrade to Agent 6

1. Set up Datadog's Yum repo on your system by creating /etc/zypp/repos.d/datadog.repo with the contents:

  ```
  [datadog]
  name=Datadog, Inc.
  enabled=1
  baseurl=https://yum.datadoghq.com/suse/stable/6/x86_64
  type=rpm-md
  gpgcheck=1
  repo_gpgcheck=0
  gpgkey=https://yum.datadoghq.com/DATADOG_RPM_KEY.public
  ```

2. Update your local zypper repo and install the Agent:

  ```
  sudo zypper refresh
  sudo rpm --import https://yum.datadoghq.com/DATADOG_RPM_KEY.public
  sudo zypper install datadog-agent
  ```

3. Copy the example config into place and plug in your API key:

  ```
  sudo sh -c "sed 's/api_key:.*/api_key: <YOUR_API_KEY>/' /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml.example > /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml"
  ```

4. Re-start the Agent:

  ```
  sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent.service
  ```

## Troubleshooting

Run the info or status command to see the state of the Agent.
The Agent logs are located in the `/var/log/datadog/` directory:

* For Agent v6 all logs are in the `agent.log` file
* For Agent v5 logs are in:
    
    * `datadog-supervisord.log`
    * `collector.log`
    * `dogstatsd.log`
    * `forwarder.log`
