If you haven't installed the Agent yet, instructions can be found [in the Datadog agent integration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/docker).

For details on how to work with the agent on Docker and on CoreOS, see the [Docker integration docs](/integrations/docker_daemon).

If you're still having trouble, [our support team](/help) will be glad to provide further assistance.
