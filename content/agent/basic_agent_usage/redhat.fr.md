## Overview

This page outlines the basic functionality of the Datadog Agent.
If you haven't installed the Agent yet, instructions can be found
[in the Datadog agent integration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/centos).

The process to upgrade from the previous version of the agent is to re-run the installation.

## Starting and Stopping the Agent
To manually start the Agent:
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent start
```

To stop the Agent:
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent stop
```

To restart the Agent and reload the configuration files:
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent restart
```

## Status and Information
To check if the Agent is running: *(since 3.8.0)*
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent status
```

To receive information about the Agentâ€™s state:
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent info
```

Tracebacks for errors can be retrieved by setting the `-v` flag: *(since 3.8.0)*
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent info -v
```

More information about the metrics, events, and service checks for an [integrations](/integrations) can be retrieved with the check command:
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent check [integration]
```

Add the check_rate argument to get the most recent values for rates:
```shell
sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent check [integration] check_rate
```

## Configuration

The configuration file for the Agent is located at `/etc/dd-agent/datadog.conf`

Configuration files for integrations are located in `/etc/dd-agent/conf.d/`

## Troubleshooting
Try running the [info command](#status-and-information) to see the state of the Agent.

Logs for the subsystems are in the following files:

* `/var/log/supervisor/datadog-supervisord.log` *(since 3.8.0)*
* `/var/log/datadog/collector.log`
* `/var/log/datadog/dogstatsd.log`
* `/var/log/datadog/forwarder.log`
