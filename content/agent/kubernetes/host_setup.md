Installing the Agent directly on your host (rather than having the Agent run in a Pod) provides additional visibility into your ecosystem, independent of Kubernetes.

To gather your kube-state metrics:

1. Download the [Kube-State manifests folder][3].

2. Apply them to your Kubernetes cluster:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f <NAME_OF_THE_KUBE_STATE_MANIFESTS_FOLDER>
  ```

## Setup Kubernetes DNS
### Configuration

Since [Agent v6][4], Kubernetes DNS integration works automatically with the [Autodiscovery][5].

- Please note that these metrics are unavailable for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at this point in time.  

## Collect container logs

**Available for Agent >6.0**

Two installations are possible:

- On the node where the agent is external to the Docker environment
- Deployed with its containerized version in the Docker environment

Take advantage of DaemonSets to [automatically deploy the Datadog Agent on all your nodes][14]. Otherwise follow the [container log collection steps][15] to start collecting logs from all your containers.
