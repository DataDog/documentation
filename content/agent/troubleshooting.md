If you ended up at this page and have not yet installed the Datadog Agent, go [to the dedicated agent integration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) for installation instructions. If you just installed the Agent, it might take a few moments before you start seeing metrics appear. The first place you should check for metrics is the [Metrics Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/explorer).

If you think you might be experiencing issues, the first thing to do is [run the info command](/agent/faq/agent-commands/#agent-status-and-information) and check the [Agent logs](/agent/basic_agent_usage/#log-location).

If you're still unsure about the issue, you may reach out to [Datadog support team](/help) along with [a flare](#send-a-flare) of your agent.

## Get more logging from the agent

To enable the full debug mode:

1. Modify your local `datadog.yaml` file (see [this page](/agent/#configuration-files) to locate this configuration file on your instance)

2. Replace `# log_level: INFO` with `log_level: DEBUG` (make sure to get rid of # to uncomment the line)

3. Restart your Datadog Agent (see [that page](/agent/faq/agent-commands) to find the restart command depending on your OS)

4. Wait a few minutes to generate some logs. [Look here](/agent/basic_agent_usage/#log-location) to find the location of the logs.

### Obtaining debug logs from the container agent

This process covers agent v6 only, for agent v5 refer to [the dedicated documentation on how to collect more logs with the Datadog container agent v5](/agent/faq/agent-5-container-more-log)

**Set the `DD_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable when starting your agent.**

If your container is already running:

1. To avoid that your process is restarted by S6, run:  
    
    `rm /var/run/s6/services/agent/finish`

2. Then stop the agent:
    
    ```
    s6-svc -d /var/run/s6/services/agent/
    ```

3. Restart then the agent with debug log level by running:
    
    ```
    DD_LOG_LEVEL=debug agent start
    ```

## Send a flare

If you are running the 5.3 version (or higher) of the agent, you're able to send all necessary troubleshooting information to our Support Team, with one flare command!

`flare` gathers all of the agent's configuration files and logs into an archive file. It removes sensitive information including passwords, API keys, Proxy credentials, and SNMP community strings.  
**Confirm the upload of the archive to immediately send it to Datadog support**.  
Since the Datadog Agent is completely open source, you can [verify the code's behavior](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/utils/flare.py). You can also review the archive prior to sending as the flare prompts a confirmation before uploading it.  

In the commands below, replace `<CASE_ID>` with your Datadog support case ID, if you don't specify a case ID, the command asks for an email address that is used to login in your organization and creates a new support case.
