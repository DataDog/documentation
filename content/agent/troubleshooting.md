If you ended up at this page and have not yet installed the Datadog Agent, go [to the dedicated Agent integration page][1] for installation instructions. If you just installed the Agent, it might take a few moments before you start seeing metrics appear. The first place you should check for metrics is the [Metrics Explorer][2].

If you think you might be experiencing issues, the first thing to do is [run the info command][3] and check the [Agent logs][4].

If you're still unsure about the issue, you may reach out to [Datadog support team][5] along with [a flare](#send-a-flare) of your Agent.

## Get more logging from the Agent

To enable the full debug mode:

1. Modify your local `datadog.yaml` file (see [this page](/agent/basic_agent_usage/#configuration-files) to locate this configuration file on your instance)

2. Replace `# log_level: INFO` with `log_level: DEBUG` (make sure to get rid of # to uncomment the line)

3. Restart your Datadog Agent (see [that page](/agent/faq/agent-commands) to find the restart command depending on your OS)

4. Wait a few minutes to generate some logs. [Look here][4] to find the location of the logs.

### Obtaining debug logs from the container Agent

This process covers Agent v6 only, for Agent v5 refer to [the dedicated documentation on how to collect more logs with the Datadog container Agent v5][6]

**Set the `DD_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable when starting your Agent.**

If your container is already running:

1. To avoid that your process is restarted by S6, run:  
    
    `rm /var/run/s6/services/agent/finish`

2. Then stop the Agent:
    
    ```
    s6-svc -d /var/run/s6/services/agent/
    ```

3. Restart then the Agent with debug log level by running:
    
    ```
    DD_LOG_LEVEL=debug agent start
    ```

## Send a flare

If you are running the 5.3 version (or higher) of the Agent, you're able to send all necessary troubleshooting information to our Support Team, with one flare command!

`flare` gathers all of the Agent's configuration files and logs into an archive file. It removes sensitive information including passwords, API keys, Proxy credentials, and SNMP community strings.  
**Confirm the upload of the archive to immediately send it to Datadog support**.  
Since the Datadog Agent is completely open source, you can [verify the code's behavior][7]. You can also review the archive prior to sending as the flare prompts a confirmation before uploading it.  

In the commands below, replace `<CASE_ID>` with your Datadog support case ID, if you don't specify a case ID, the command asks for an email address that is used to login in your organization and creates a new support case.

## Status of an Agent check

Agent checks must be called by the Agent. To test an Agent check, run:

| Agent version | Command                                             |
| :------       | :----                                               |
| v5.x          | `sudo -u dd-agent dd-agent check <CHECK_NAME>`      |
| v6.x          | `sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent check <CHECK_NAME>` |

If you want to include rate metrics, add `--check-rate` to your command, for instance for Agent v6.x run:

```
sudo -u dd-agent datadog-agent check <CHECK_NAME> --check-rate
```

If your issue continues, [reach out to our Support team][5] with a [flare](#flare).

### Windows

* **For Agent version < 5.12**:
    The Agent install includes a file called `shell.exe` in your `\Program Files\` directory for the Datadog Agent which you can use to run Python within the Agent environment. Once your check (called `<CHECK_NAME>`) is written and you have the `.py` and `.yaml` files in their correct places, you can run the following in shell.exe:
    ```
    from checks import run_check
    run_check('<CHECK_NAME>')
    ```
    This outputs any metrics or events that the check returns.

* **For Agent version >= 5.12**:
    Run the following script, with the proper `<CHECK_NAME>`:
    `<INSTALL_DIR>/embedded/python.exe <INSTALL_DIR>agent/agent.py check <CHECK_NAME>`
    For example, to run the disk check:
    ```
    C:\Program' 'Files\Datadog\Datadog' 'Agent\embedded\python.exe C:\Program' 'Files\Datadog\Datadog' 'Agent\agent\agent.py check disk
    ```

* **For Agent version > 6.0**:
    Run the following script, with the proper `<CHECK_NAME>`:
    ```
    C:\Program Files\Datadog\Datadog agent\embedded\agent.exe check <CHECK_NAME>
    ```
