**Traffic is always initiated by the Agent to Datadog. No sessions are ever initiated from Datadog back to the Agent**:

* All traffic is sent over SSL
* The destination for:
    * [APM][1] data is `trace.agent.datadoghq.com`
    * [Live Containers][2] data is `process.datadoghq.com`
    * [Logs][3] data is `agent-intake.logs.datadoghq.com `
    * All other Agent data:
        * **Agents < 5.2.0** `app.datadoghq.com`
        *  **Agents >= 5.2.0** `<version>-app.agent.datadoghq.com`

This decision was taken after the POODLE problem. Versioned endpoints start with Agent v5.2.0, where each version of the Agent calls a different endpoint based on the version of the *Forwarder*. For example, Agent v5.2.0 calls `5-2-0-app.agent.datadoghq.com`. Therefore you must whitelist `*.agent.datadoghq.com` in your firewall(s).

These domains are **CNAME** records pointing to a set of static IP addresses. These addresses can be found at:  

* **[https://ip-ranges.datadoghq.com][4]**

The information is structured as JSON following this schema:

```
{
    "version": 1,                       // <-- incremented every time this information is changed
    "modified": "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS",  // <-- timestamp of the last modification
    "agents": {                         // <-- the IPs used by the Agent to submit metrics to Datadog
        "prefixes_ipv4": [              // <-- list of IPv4 CIDR blocks
            "a.b.c.d/x",
            ...
        ],
        "prefixes_ipv6": [              // <-- list of IPv6 CIDR blocks
            ...
        ]
    },
    "apm": {...},                       // <-- same structure as "agents" but IPs used for the APM Agent data
    "logs": {...},                      // <-- same for the logs Agent data
    "process": {...},                   // <-- same for the process Agent data
    "api": {...},                       // <-- not used for Agent traffic (submitting data via API)
    "webhooks": {...}                   // <-- not used for Agent traffic (Datadog source IPs delivering webhooks)
}
```

Each section has a dedicated endpoint at `https://ip-ranges.datadoghq.com/<section>.json`, for example:

* [https://ip-ranges.datadoghq.com/logs.json][10] for the IPs used to receive logs data
* [https://ip-ranges.datadoghq.com/apm.json][11] for the IPs used to receive APM data

### Note

You should whitelist all of these IPs. While only a subset are active at any given moment, there are variations over time within the entire set due to regular network operation and maintenance.

## Open Ports

**All outbound traffic is sent over SSL via TCP.**

Open the following ports in order to benefit from all the Agent functionalities: 

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Agent v6" %}}

* **Outbound**:

  * `443/tcp`: port for most Agent data. (Metrics, APM, Live Processes/Containers) 
  * `123/udp`: NTP - [More details on the importance of NTP][5].
  * `10516/tcp`: port for the [Log collection][3]
  * `10255/tcp`: port for the [Kubernetes http kubelet][8]
  * `10250/tcp`: port for the [Kubernetes https kubelet][8]

* **Inbound (used for Agent services communicating among themselves locally within the host only)**:

  * `5000/tcp`: port for the [go_expvar server][6]
  * `5001/tcp`: port on which the IPC api listens
  * `5002/tcp`: port for [the Agent browser GUI to be served][7]
  * `8125/udp`: dogstatsd. Unless `dogstatsd_non_local_traffic` is set to true. This port is available on localhost: 

      * `127.0.0.1`
      * `::1` 
      * `fe80::1`
  
  * `8126/tcp`: port for the [APM Receiver][1]

  * `8126/tcp`: port for the [APM Receiver][1]
  * `17123/tcp`: Agent forwarder, used to buffer traffic in case of network splits between the Agent and Datadog
  * `17124/tcp`: optional graphite adapter
