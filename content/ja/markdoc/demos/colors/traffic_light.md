    This test page explores everyday items that are green, yellow, or red --
    which also happen to be the colors of the common traffic light. If this

        Grass is a common plant found in many environments, from lawns and
        gardens to fields and meadows. It plays a crucial role in ecosystems by
        providing food and habitat for various animals, including insects,
        birds, and mammals.
      </p>

        Grass is also important for soil health, as its roots help prevent

        for aesthetic and recreational purposes, creating green spaces for
        relaxation and play. Its lush, green appearance is a symbol of vitality
