    This test page explores everyday items that are blue, yellow, or red --
    which also happen to be the primary colors of the color wheel. If this seems
    contrived and odd, that's only because test pages are often both of those
    things.

        of red, orange, and pink. It is home to various weather phenomena,
        including clouds, rainbows, and storms, and serves as the backdrop for
        celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars. The sky's vastness and
        ever-changing nature inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity.
