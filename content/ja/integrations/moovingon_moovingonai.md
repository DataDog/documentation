## 概要

moovingon.ai revolutionizes the way cloud operations and NOC teams manage the reliability and resilience of production systems. By merging and optimizing alerts within your observability framework, and connecting these alerts to automatic runbooks, you're fostering a simpler and more efficient operation. This method ensures your systems are under tight surveillance and that any incident is promptly resolved, cutting down on downtime and enhancing operational efficiency.

Through the [out-of-the-box integration](https://app.datadoghq.com/integrations/moovingon-ai), moovingon.ai uses Datadog's monitors, logs, and event data for alert correlation and aggregation.

All remediation actions performed in moovingon.ai are sent to Datadog as events for compliance and remediation clarity. Additionally, moovingon.ai provides analytics that allow you to derive insights from Datadog alerts within Datadog. This assists in proactive decision-making and trend analysis.
