## Overview

With [Rollbar][1], you can go beyond traditional error monitoring tools with our AI-assisted grouping that helps development teams pinpoint errors in seconds. Proactively discover errors in real time, alert the right people, automatically rollback, and fix.

### Automation grade grouping
Reduce noise in error monitoring that builds developer trust. Easier triaging by removing duplicates from error lists and faster response to errors through less manual effort and more automation.

### AI-assisted workflows
Proactive workflows with faster response to issues. Lower mean time to awareness (MTTA) and mean time to resolutions (MTTR) to maintain high-quality customer experiences.

### Link errors with each deploy
Get code context on each error to debug quickly at scale. See the stack trace with the offending line of code, retrieve `git blame` information, keep track of each deployment, and moreâ€”all in one place.

### Seamless integrations
Datadog, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, Atlassian, Google Cloud, Terraform, Heroku, Slack, CircleCI

### Security in mind
Fully compliant with stringent industry standards and builds features that help you do the same.
