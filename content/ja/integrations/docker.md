## Overview

Docker is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.

Get metrics from Docker in real time to:

- Visualize your containers' performance
- Correlate the performance of containers with the applications running inside

## Setup

If you want to run the Agent inside a container, see the [Docker Agent documentation][1].


## Data Collected

For information about metrics, events, and service checks, see [Docker Data Collected][2].
