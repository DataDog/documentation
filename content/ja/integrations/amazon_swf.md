## Overview

Amazon SWF helps developers build, run, and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your SWF metrics.

## Setup

### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration][1] first.

### Metric collection

1. In the [AWS integration page][2], ensure that `SWF` is enabled under the `Metric Collection` tab.
2. Install the [Datadog - Amazon SWF integration][3].

### Log collection

#### Enable logging

Configure Amazon SWF to send logs either to a S3 bucket or to CloudWatch.

**Note**: If you log to a S3 bucket, make sure that `amazon_swf` is set as _Target prefix_.

#### Send logs to Datadog

1. If you havenâ€™t already, set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][4].
2. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group that contains your Amazon SWF logs in the AWS console:

    - [Add a manual trigger on the S3 bucket][5]
    - [Add a manual trigger on the CloudWatch Log Group][6]

## Data Collected

### Metrics
{{< get-metrics-from-git "amazon_swf" >}}


Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS are assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.

### Events

The Amazon SWF integration does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The Amazon SWF integration does not include any service checks.
