# Overview

Connect Consul to Datadog in order to:

* Correlate the performance of Consul with the rest of your applications
* Monitor the health of your Consul cluster

# Metrics

<%= get_metrics_from_git() %>

For each service that you're monitoring we'll create the `consul.catalog.nodes_up` gauge metric tagged by `consul_service_id` that will let you know how many Consul nodes are running each service. We'll also collect `consul.catalog.service_u` tagged by `consul_node_id` that measures how many services a node is running.
Finally, we perform a service check `consul.check` that will report on the state of each service.

The other consul metrics collected are not service bound but node bound, and only `consul.peers` is tagged with `mode:leader` or `mode:follower`.
