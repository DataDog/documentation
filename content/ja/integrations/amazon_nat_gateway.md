## Overview

Use AWS NAT Gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with the instances.

Enable this integration to see all your NAT Gateway metrics in Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration][1] first.

### Metric collection

1. In the [AWS integration page][2], ensure that `NATGateway` is enabled under the `Metric Collection` tab.
2. Install the [Datadog - AWS NAT Gateway integration][3].

### Log collection

#### Enable logging

Configure AWS NAT Gateway to send logs either to a S3 bucket or to CloudWatch.

**Note**: If you log to a S3 bucket, make sure that `amazon_nat_gateway` is set as _Target prefix_.

#### Send logs to Datadog

1. If you havenâ€™t already, set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][4].
2. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group that contains your AWS NAT Gateway logs in the AWS console:

    - [Add a manual trigger on the S3 bucket][5]
    - [Add a manual trigger on the CloudWatch Log Group][6]
