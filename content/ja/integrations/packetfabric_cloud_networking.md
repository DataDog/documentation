## 概要

PacketFabric provides a global Network as a Service. It delivers dynamic, real-time network connectivity between major carrier-neutral colocation facilities and leading cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. PacketFabric operates a carrier-grade 70TB+ network that is private and secure, with a five-nines Service-Level Agreement. Customers can order network services such as hosted or dedicated cloud connections and Cloud Routers (CR) from a self-service platform and have them live in minutes, not months.

Enterprises use PacketFabric to operate their entire WAN backbone or connect their hybrid cloud and multi-cloud infrastructure, enabling application development and improving application performance.

PacketFabric customers who use Datadog can see real-time network metrics within Datadog.
