Install the Google App Engine integration in your Python project to:

* See your Google App Engine services metrics: memcache, task queues, datastores
* See metrics about requests: display percentiles, latency, cost
* Tag Google App Engine metrics by version and compare the performance of different versions

You can also send custom metrics to Datadog.
