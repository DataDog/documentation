## Overview

The Microsoft Office 365 integration monitors product activity, usage, and licensing of Exchange, Outlook, Sharepoint, OneDrive, Yammer, Teams, and Skype. The integration also runs synthetic operations in Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive to provide application performance monitoring from multiple locations worldwide. The Office 365 integration comes with a dashboard that allows you to filter based on User, OneDrive, Sharepoint URL, and more. It also uses Datadog Synthetic checks to validate that the Office 365 URLs are online and responding in an acceptable time frame.

All integrations can be toggled on and off in the ```o365.yaml``` file as part of the integration. It is recommended to disable any products you do not want to monitor in order to avoid usage of additional metrics.
