## Overview

Amazon EMR is a web service that makes it easy to quickly and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data.

Enable this integration to see EMR metrics in Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration][1] first.

### Metric collection

1. In the [AWS integration page][2], ensure that `EMR` is enabled under the `Metric Collection` tab.
2. Add the following permissions to your [Datadog IAM policy][3] to collect Amazon EMR metrics. For more information, see the [EMR policies][4] on the AWS website.

    | AWS Permission                     | Description                         |
    | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
    | `elasticmapreduce:ListClusters`    | List available clusters.            |
    | `elasticmapreduce:DescribeCluster` | Add tags to CloudWatch EMR metrics. |

3. Install the [Datadog - Amazon EMR integration][5].

### Log collection

#### Enable logging

Configure Amazon EMR to send logs either to a S3 bucket or to CloudWatch.

**Note**: If you log to a S3 bucket, make sure that `amazon_emr` is set as _Target prefix_.

#### Send logs to Datadog

1. If you havenâ€™t already, set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][6].
2. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group that contains your Amazon EMR logs in the AWS console:

    - [Add a manual trigger on the S3 bucket][7]
    - [Add a manual trigger on the CloudWatch Log Group][8]

## Data Collected

### Metrics
{{< get-metrics-from-git "amazon_emr" >}}


Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS is assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.

### Events

The Amazon EMR integration does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The Amazon EMR integration does not include any service checks.
