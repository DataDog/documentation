## Overview

Upstash is a serverless data provider enabling RedisÂ®, Kafka, and messaging/scheduling solutions for a diverse range of applications that provides speed, simplicity, and a seamless developer experience. Upstash uses the Redis and Kafka APIs, and is designed for:

* Serverless functions (AWS Lambda)
* Cloudflare Workers
* Fastly Compute@Edge
* Next.js Edge, Remix, and more
* Client-side web or mobile applications
* AI development
* WebAssembly and other environments where HTTP is preferred over TCP connections

To centralize your monitoring stack and enable a comprehensive view of your data, the Upstash integration sends the following metrics to Datadog:
    * Hit/Miss Rate
    * Read/Write Latency (p99)
    * Keyspace
    * Number of Connections
    * Bandwidth
    * Total Data Size
    * Throughput

## Setup

Once installed, navigate to the **Configure** tab and click **Connect Accounts**. This guides you through the Datadog OAuth flow to grant Upstash access to your database metrics.

## Uninstallation
