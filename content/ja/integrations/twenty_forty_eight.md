## Overview

Twenty Forty Eight is a fun game you can add to your Datadog dashboards. This extension is made possible by [Datadog apps][1] which extends the user-interface with third party content not supported natively. If you are interested in extending your Datadog experience for business or for fun, you can [build out an app or game of your own][1].

### How to play

Click on the widget to activate the app, then use your **arrow keys** to move the tiles. Tiles with the same number **merge into one** when they touch. Add them up to reach 2048 and beyond!

## セットアップ

1. In your Datadog account, navigate to Dashboards. Select the dashboard that you would like to add the game to or [create a new dashboard][2].

2. In the dashboard, click **+Add Widgets** to the right of the dashboard title. Scroll to the right through the widgets, and then drag and drop the **Twenty Forty Eight** widget into the desired position on your dashboard.
