### Overview
{:#int-overview}

Connect PagerDuty to Datadog in order to:

- Trigger and resolve incidents from your stream by mentioning @pagerduty in your post
- See incidents and escalations in your stream as they occur
- Get a daily reminder of who's on-call


You can also check out [this documentation](http://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/datadog-integration-guide/) from Pagerduty.

Once you have Pagerduty integrated, you can check out our custom [Pagerduty Incident Trends](https://app.datadoghq.com/report/pagerduty).
