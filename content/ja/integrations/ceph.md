# Overview

Enable the Datadog-Ceph integration to:

  * Track disk usage across storage pools
  * Receive service checks in case of issues
  * Monitor I/O performance metrics


# Installation

The integration is meant to be enabled on each Ceph monitor host.

# Configuration

Adjust the configuration file to match your environment. By default the check will use `/usr/bin/ceph` to retrieve metrics; this can be overriden by using the `ceph_cmd` option. If sudo access is required to run it, please enable the use_sudo flag.

Any extra tags specific to the cluster can be specified under `tags`, as usual.

# Validation

Execute the info command `/etc/init.d/datadog-agent info` and verify that the integration check was successful. The output should contain a section similar to the following:

        Checks
