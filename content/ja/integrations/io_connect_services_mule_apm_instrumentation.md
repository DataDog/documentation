## 概要

Using the Datadog Mule® Integration for APM, our engineers instrument Mule applications within your environment to create and send traces to Datadog APM, providing a 24x7 gain in end-to-end visibility.

As a Datadog Gold Partner, as well as the creator of the Datadog Mule® Integration and Datadog Mule® Integration for APM, IO Connect Services has extensive deep expertise building and implementing enterprise-grade solutions.

Our experts will:
 * Establish a strategy for tracing within your Mule applications and APIs.
 * Install the [Datadog Mule® Integration for APM][1] in up to three environments:
development, QA, and production.
 * Instrument the Mule applications with APM to create traces in Datadog.
 * Inject metadata to traces and spans to help in the creation of reports and dashboards.
 * Mark spans statuses and HTTP codes appropriately.
 * Correlate logs with APM traces.
