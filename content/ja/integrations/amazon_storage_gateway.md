## Overview

AWS Storage Gateway provides seamless and secure integration between an organization's IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure.

Enable this integration to see in Datadog all your Storage Gateway metrics.

## Setup

### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration first][1].

### Metric collection

1. In the [AWS integration page][2], ensure that `StorageGateway` is enabled under the `Metric Collection` tab.
2. Install the [Datadog - AWS Storage Gateway integration][3].

### Log collection

#### Enable logging

Configure AWS Storage Gateway to send logs either to a S3 bucket or to CloudWatch.

**Note**: If you log to a S3 bucket, make sure that `amazon_storage_gateway` is set as _Target prefix_.

#### Send logs to Datadog

1. If you havenâ€™t already, set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][4].
2. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group that contains your AWS Storage Gateway logs in the AWS console:

    - [Add a manual trigger on the S3 bucket][5]
    - [Add a manual trigger on the CloudWatch Log Group][6]

## Data Collected

### Metrics
{{< get-metrics-from-git "amazon_storage_gateway" >}}


Each of the metrics retrieved from AWS are assigned the same tags that appear in the AWS console, including but not limited to host name, security-groups, and more.

### Events

The AWS Storage Gateway integration does not include any events.

### Service Checks

The AWS Storage Gateway integration does not include any service checks.
