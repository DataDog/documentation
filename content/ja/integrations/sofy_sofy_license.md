## Overview

[Sofy][4] is a no-code testing platform for mobile apps. It enables you to run QA tests from your CI/CD pipeline on real devices without a single line of code. Sofy simplifies test planning, automation, environments, execution, reporting, and debugging. Save time, improve release quality, and deliver frictionless mobile app experiences.

The [Sofy integration][1] provides deeper insight into your testing process by visualizing key metrics and trends such as load time, network, memory utilization, and CPU. The out-of-the-box dashboard provides real-time visibility into your Sofy test results, enabling you to monitor and analyze performance over time, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall software quality.

By signing up for Sofy from the Datadog Marketplace, you get an extra 500 device minutes per month for the next 12 months.
