## Overview

### About CircleCI
The world’s best software teams use CircleCI to deliver quality code with confidence. As the largest continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) platform, CircleCI empowers engineers to seamlessly take ideas to execution, at scale. Every feature of the platform is built to fine-tune the entire development process from start to finish.

CircleCI offers the widest choices for customizing operating systems, CPUs, GPUs, memory, and images for each job. Build for Docker, Windows, Linux, ARM, macOS, or build your own compute with runners, all for free.

Teams can orchestrate complex workflows in the cloud, managed by CircleCI, or with a server plan, self-hosted by you.

### Product Overview

#### Fastest build times on the market
Build times on CircleCI are 70% faster on average than competitors.

#### The highest level of compliance and certification
CircleCI is the only CI/CD platform that’s FedRAMP and SOC 2 Type II certified. Built-in features like audit logs, restricted contexts, and LDAP give you complete control of your code.

#### Greater visibility throughout the software development process
CircleCI’s Insights dashboard gives visibility into workflow status, duration, credit consumption, and costs, for free.

#### SSH debugging
Securely access any job in CircleCI to debug builds and tests in real time.

#### Auto-test splitting
Shorten the feedback loop by automatically splitting your tests across parallel instances of the same job.

### Highlights

Your CI/CD process is the heartbeat of your engineering organization. With CircleCI, teams are never limited in their ability to grow and innovate. The expert CircleCI team is here to guide and support you every step of the way.

#### Confidence in every commit
Take control of your code and manage every source of change. CircleCI means change validation, at every step. Trust that you can release updates right when your customers need them, with the certainty they’ll work every time.

#### The power to create without limits
