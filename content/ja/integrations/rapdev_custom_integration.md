## Overview

At [RapDev][3], we are proud members of the Datadog ecosystem and winners of Partner of the Year in 2022 and 2023. In addition to our services offerings, we build marketplace integrations that help you unlock the power of observability with Datadog.

We have worked with over 100 customers on over 40 integrations designed to extend and enrich Datadog’s observability capabilities.   

### Our integrations extend and enrich Datadog observability

At RapDev, we are a Datadog Gold Partner and Partner of the Year, and we work with an industry-leading team of Datadog engineers with experience leveraging the full power of Datadog's application and infrastructure monitoring capabilities. Our integrations plug into third-party services, APIs, and data sources spanning across all varieties of environments and infrastructure to give you true end-to-end observability. With knowledge in application and web development, security, infrastructure, and more, our team can help build a custom integration tailored to the specific observability needs of your organization.

### It’s easy and quick 

Our team is available to work directly with you to ensure that we generate and satisfy a list of all requirements to meet your observability objectives. This includes (but is not limited to) the following topics:
- Outlining desired business objectives, use cases, and user stories
- Running through your specific environment and architecture
- Gathering functional and non-functional requirements
