# Overview
Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service that runs web, mobile, API and business logic applications and automatically manages the resources required by those apps.

Get metrics from Azure App Service to:

* Visualize your app performance
* Correlate the performance of your Azure Apps with the rest of your apps

# Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Microsoft Azure integration first](/integrations/azure). There are no other installation steps that need to be performed.
