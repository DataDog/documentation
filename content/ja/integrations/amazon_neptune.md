## Overview

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.

Enable this integration to see all your Neptune metrics in Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration][1] first.

### Metric collection

1. In the [AWS integration page][2], ensure that `Neptune` is enabled under the `Metric Collection` tab.
2. Install the [Datadog - Amazon Neptune integration][3].

### Log collection

#### Enable logging

Configure Amazon Neptune to send logs either to a S3 bucket or to CloudWatch.

**Note**: If you log to a S3 bucket, make sure that `amazon_neptune` is set as _Target prefix_.

#### Send logs to Datadog

1. If you havenâ€™t already, set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][4].
2. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group that contains your Amazon Neptune logs in the AWS console:

    - [Add a manual trigger on the S3 bucket][5]
    - [Add a manual trigger on the CloudWatch Log Group][6]
