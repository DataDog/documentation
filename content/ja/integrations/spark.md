# Configuration

*Install Datadog Agent on the Master Node where the ResourceManager is running*

1.  Configure the agent to connect to the ResourceManager. Edit `conf.d/spark.yaml`

        init_config:

        instances:
          #
          # The Spark check retrieves metrics from YARN's ResourceManager. This
          # check must be run from the Master Node and the ResourceManager URI must
          # be specified below. The ResourceManager URI is composed of the
          # ResourceManager's hostname and port.
          #
          # The ResourceManager hostname can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file
          # under the property yarn.resourcemanager.address
          #
          # The ResourceManager port can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file under
          # the property yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address
          #
          - resourcemanager_uri: http://localhost:8088

          # An optional friendly name can be specified for the cluster.
          #   cluster_name: MySparkCluster

            # Additional tags can be specified for the metrics.
            # tags:
            #   - optional_tag1
            #   - optional_tag2
