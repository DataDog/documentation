## Overview

AWS CodeBuild is a build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

Install the Datadog AWS CodeBuild integration to:

- Track your builds by project
- Collect metrics on your builds
- Correlate builds with the rest of your Datadog metrics

## Setup

### Installation

If you haven't already, set up the [Amazon Web Services integration][1] first.

### Metric collection

1. In the [AWS integration page][2], ensure that `CloudBuild` is enabled under the `Metric Collection` tab.

2. Install the [Datadog - AWS Codebuild integration][3].

### Log collection

#### Enable logging

Configure AWS CodeBuild to send logs either to a S3 bucket or to CloudWatch.

**Note**: If you log to a S3 bucket, make sure that `amazon_codebuild` is set as _Target prefix_.

#### Send logs to Datadog

1. If you havenâ€™t already, set up the [Datadog Forwarder Lambda function][4].
2. Once the Lambda function is installed, manually add a trigger on the S3 bucket or CloudWatch log group that contains your AWS CodeBuild logs in the AWS console:

    - [Add a manual trigger on the S3 bucket][5]
    - [Add a manual trigger on the CloudWatch Log Group][6]
