## Overview
[Twingate](https://twingate.com) is the modern replacement for insecure VPNs.

With Twingate you can easily manage network access policies tied to on-prem, cloud, and SaaS applications. The platform also integrates with your Identity provider, MDM/EDR platforms, and data observability platforms like Datadog to help recognize network access patterns at scale. 

The Twingate Business Tier includes:

- Identity provider integrations with Okta, JumpCloud, OneLogin, Google Workspace and Azure AD
- Device controls via MDM/EDR integrations (JAMF, Crowdstrike, InTune, etc.)
- Standard support

To subscribe to our Enterprise tier, purchase through the Datadog Marketplace and a member of Twingate staff can help you upgrade your account.
