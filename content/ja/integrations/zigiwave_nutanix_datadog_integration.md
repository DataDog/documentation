## Overview

ZigiOps is the most flexible, no-code integration platform. The ZigiOps product
helps your businesses identify, report, and resolve issues in your IT 
environments faster than ever. Integrate ZigiOps into your software ecosystem to connect to popular enterprise 
software tools for ITSM, ITOM, and DevOps: Jira, ServiceNow, VMware 
vROps, Micro Focus Ops Bridge, BMC, Cherwell, Splunk, and more.

### Datadog – Nutanix with ZigiOps

With the ZigiWave Datadog - Nutanix integration, you can extract alerts from Nutanix and populate them in Datadog. ZigiOps syncs all fields such as the incident summary, detection method, severity, status, and more.

### Incidents

ZigiOps offers fully customizable integration templates for the Datadog – Nutanix integration, including a template that maps Nutanix alerts to Datadog incidents. Users can modify data mappings and filters provided by the templates to make them fit with their use case. If your use case doesn’t fit within the template, you can also create an integration from scratch. Integration consultants will guide you along the way.

## Support

We at ZigiWave are dedicated to providing the best customer experience 
for our users.  If you are an existing user, you can submit a ticket from 
support.zigiwave.com or email our team at support@zigiwave.com.
