## Overview

RapDev is a Datadog Gold Partner focusing on enterprise scale Datadog implementations. With over 100 successful implementations and over 25 Datadog Marketplace integrations, RapDev's expertise with Datadog has lead us to receive the Datadog Solutions Integration Partner of the Year Award for 2022 and 2023.

With **Usage Tracker**, you can monitor any surges in usage before receiving unexpected costs. The main benefits are: 
1. **Visibility**: Get visibility into your Datadog usage and actionable insights to optimize the value you gain from your observability solution. 
2. **Convenience**: Get alerts right in your inbox and get access to the enriched data you need to diagnose usage spikes.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Use the out-of-the-box dashboards to gain the context you need to identify underlying configuration issues and usage changes.

This is a hosted service; in order to get started, RapDev will access to the following information:
- API key to your Datadog account
- Application key to your Datadog account with the following scopes:
    - `metrics_read`
    - `events_read`
    - `timeseries_query`
