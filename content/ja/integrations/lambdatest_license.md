## Overview

[LambdaTest][4] is a cloud-based test execution platform that allows users to run both manual and automated tests on websites and web applications across 2000+ browsers, browser versions, and operating systems.

LambdaTest can run manual and automated tests, and supports various automation testing frameworks like Selenium, Cypress, and TestCafe. In addition, you can log bugs with a single click while performing cross-browser testing of your websites (and web applications) from the LambdaTest platform to Datadog. LambdaTest automatically includes details from the testing environment, such as browser version, OS, resolution, comments, along with screenshots.

With LambdaTest, you have access to:  

- Live-interactive testing across 2000+ browsers and real machines hosted on cloud-based infrastructure.
- An online automation testing grid that supports Selenium and Cypress tests with any CI/CD pipeline to help QA teams validate and ship quality builds faster.
- A next-gen, developer-friendly browser that helps you build well-performing and responsive websites with speed.
- 100+ integrations with third-party tools for project management, communication, codeless automation, CI/CD, and more.
- 24/7 chat support.
- Lifetime free access to the platform with 100 free automation testing minutes.

You can purchase a subscription to LambdaTest through the Datadog Marketplace. Once you have your LambdaTest account set up (or if you're already a customer of LambdaTest), navigate to the [integration tile][1] to start sending data into Datadog.
