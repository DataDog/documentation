<h3>Overview</h3>

Capture Redmine activity in Datadog to:
<ul>
<li> Track your development cycle. </li>
<li> View open issues in the Datadog event stream.</li>
<li> Discuss projects with your team.</li>
</ul>
</div>

The Redmine configuration just requires a full URL to the desired activity feed (you can add multiple URLs).
