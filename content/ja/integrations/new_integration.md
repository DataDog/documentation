<p>Being able to
see all of your metrics from across your infrastructure is key within Datadog.
While we do have guides to submit <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/metrics/">custom metrics</a>
via our <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/api/">API</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/libraries/">code instrumentation</a>,
it's possible you might want to see a certain source become an
official integration. Overall, the largest deciding factor in what integrations
we build is what our clients request.</p>

<p>If you would like to propose an
integration, please reach out to support@datadoghq.com and tell us what metrics
you would like to see from that given source.</p>

<p>If you manage or work with a
service and would like to see Datadog integrate it, the following information
is needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How will data get into Datadog? There are currently three options:
    <ol>
      <li>Push data from the source to Datadog</li>
      <li>Crawl the data source's API</li>
      <li>Have the Datadog Agent pick up the information from the source</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What are the metrics and tags should be picked up from the source?</li>
  <li>What metrics should be included on the default dashboard that we generate for each integration?</li>
</ul>


<p>We will also need a short blurb describing the integration as well as the correct
image to use across our site. </p>
