## 概要

[IsDown][1] is a status page aggregator and outage monitoring tool that helps businesses monitor their dependencies. Using IsDown, provide your team with real-time monitoring and instant notifications for outages in all your tools and cloud providers. IsDown monitors more than 3100 status pages.

Through the [out-of-the-box integration][3], you can receive alerts from third-party dependencies in Datadog, monitor business critical services, and understand the frequency of outages all within the out-of-the-box dashboard.

### All-in-one monitoring
Monitor all official status pages and your own services in Datadog, streamlining the process and keeping your team updated in real-time on essential service health.

### Instant outage alerts
IsDown instantly alerts when there is an outage, enabling quicker response times and reducing the downtime's impact on your business operations.

### Customizable monitoring
Monitor only the vital services and components of third party dependencies, ensuring you receive relevant outage notifications and avoid unneeded alerts.

### 10 minute setup
Seamlessly integrate with Datadog. Choose the services to monitor, connect to Datadog, and immediately have access to all your cloud providers' statuses and outages.
