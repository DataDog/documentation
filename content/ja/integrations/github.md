<h3>Overview</h3>

Capture GitHub commits in Datadog to:
<ul>
<li> Track new features from code changes</li>
<li> Identify when new code changes lead to system alerts or build failures</li>
<li> Discuss code changes with your team in the Datadog Event Stream</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="int-configuration">

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Select 'Github' <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings">here</a> and link your account.
You can then select which repos you would like to integrate, which branches, and if you'd like to
receive commits and/or issues.

</div>

<h3>What to Expect</h3>
Once the integration is complete, whatever you select (commits and/or issues) will populate
into your Datadog Event Stream.

If you view a dashboard, in the top left search bar you can type <code>sources:github</code> to see github
events overlayed over your the graphs on that dashboard.
