Powerpacks are templated groups of widgets that scale graphing expertise as reusable dashboard building blocks. 

Powerpacks are either preset (created by Datadog, available to all customers) or custom (created by a user, and only available within their organization). For more information, <a href="/dashboards/widgets/powerpack/">see the documentation</a>.
