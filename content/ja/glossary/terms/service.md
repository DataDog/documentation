1. In APM, a service is a group of related endpoints, queries, or jobs that perform a piece of work for your application. A microservices-based architecture is built from multiple services, each performing part of the operation of the application.
2. In serverless computing, a service is an independently-deployed piece of functionality in your architecture. Serverless applications are powered by managed services.
