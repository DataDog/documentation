Alerts are grouped automatically based on your selection of the `group by` aggregation step when defining your metric. Any added aggregations result in a "multi alert" type, and no aggregation is a "simple alert" type. For more information, <a href="/monitors/configuration/?tab=thresholdalert#alert-grouping">see the documentation</a>.
