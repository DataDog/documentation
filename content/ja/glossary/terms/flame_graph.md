A flame graph is a visualization of a trace, where bars represent spans and show the span's execution time as well as what called it and what calls it made. 

A flame graph is also the <a href="/profiler/profile_visualizations/#flame-graph">default visualization</a> for Continuous Profiler. It shows resource consumption (such as CPU usage) per method, and how each method was called.
