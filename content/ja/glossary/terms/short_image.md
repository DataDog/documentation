A short image is a container image name that does not include the registry hostname, namespace, or tag. You can also think of a short image as a substring between the last slash (`/`) and the last colon (`:`) of a full container image string. For example: for the container image `gcr.io/datadoghq/agent:latest`, the short image is `agent`.
