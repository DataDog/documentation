The term _tail_ is derived from the `tail` command in Unix and Linux operating systems. Tailing is an alternative to printing the entire contents of a file. When you tail a file, you print the last few lines of the file to the terminal. Tailing is commonly used with log files to find the most recently logged events for a process or service. You can set the Datadog Agent up to tail a log file. For more information see [Custom log collection][1].
