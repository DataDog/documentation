## 概要

Recommended monitors are a collection of monitor templates that are pre-configured by Datadog and integration partners. Use recommended monitors to: 
- Save the time and effort of creating a new monitor from scratch.
- Have comprehensive monitoring coverage for all your critical integrations.

Recommended Monitors are available out-of-the-box, so you can get started immediately after you finish installing the Datadog Agent and add integrations. 

Navigate to the [**Monitor List**][2] page. If you have fewer than 10 monitors, Datadog automatically provides a list of recommended templates based on your installed integrations.

To browse the full list of monitor templates, navigate to the [**Monitors Templates**][1] page. Filter and search all available Recommended Monitors for your installed integrations as well as all available templates.
