## 概要

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a set of rules and regulations passed in 1996 that aims to protect and ensure the confidential handling of protected health information (PHI). It affects healthcare providers, health plans, and similar organizations known as "covered entities," as well as vendors working with these healthcare-related organizations known as "business associates."

Organizations use cloud-based solutions to manage patient data, which requires adherence to HIPAA regulations. Datadog provides HIPAA compliant observability and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.
