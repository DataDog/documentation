Tagging is used throughout the Datadog product to make it easier to subset and query the machines and metrics that you have to monitor. Without the ability to assign and filter based on tags, finding the problems that exist in your environment and narrowing them down enough to discover the true causes would be extremely difficult. [Discover our tagging best practices before going further][61].

## How to assign tags
There are four primary ways to assign tags: inherited from the [integration][1], in the configuration, in the UI, and using the API, though the UI and API only allow you to assign tags at the host level. The recommended method is to rely on the [integrations][1] or via the configuration files.

### Inheriting tags from an integration

The easiest method for assigning tags is to rely on the integration. Tags assigned to your Amazon Web Services instances, Chef recipes, and more are all automatically assigned to the hosts and metrics when they are brought in to Datadog.

The following [integrations][1] sources create tags automatically in Datadog:

### Assigning tags using the configuration files
[The Datadog integrations][1] are all configured via the yaml configuration files located in the **conf.d** directory in your Agent install. For more about where to look for your configuration files, refer [to this article][59].

Define tags in the configuration file for the overall Agent as well as for each integration.
In YAML files, there is a tag dictionary with a list of tags you want assigned at that level. Any tag you assign to the Agent is applied to every integration on that Agent's host.

Dictionaries with lists of values have two different yet functionally equivalent forms:

    tags: key_first_tag:value_1, key_second_tag:value_2, key_third_tag:value_3

or

    tags:
      - key_first_tag:value_1
      - key_second_tag:value_2
      - key_third_tag:value_3

You see both forms in the yaml configuration files, but for the `datadog.yaml` init file only the first form is valid.

Each tag can be anything you like but you have the best success with tagging if your tags are `key:value` pairs. Keys could represent the role, or function, or region, or application and the value is the instance of that role, function, region, or application. Here are some examples of good tags:

    region:east
    region:nw
    application:database
    database:primary
    role:sobotka

The reason why you should use key value pairs instead of values becomes apparent when you start using the tags to filter and group metrics and machines. That said, you are not required to use key value pairs and simple values are valid.

### Assigning host tags in the UI

You can also assign tags to hosts, but not to [integration][1] in the UI. To assign tags in the UI, start by going to the Infrastructure List page. Click on any host and then click the Update Host Tags button. In the host overlay that appears, click Edit Tags and make the changes you wish.

### Assigning host tags using the API

You can also assign tags to hosts, but not to [integration][1] using the API. The endpoints you want to work with are /tags/hosts and depending on whether you PUT, POST, or DELETE you update, add, or delete tags for the chosen host. For more details on using the Tags endpoints in the API, [review this document][60]
