<p><strong>Not sure where to look?</strong> Our documentation is split into guides and references. Guides explain how to
    accomplish a particular task with Datadog, while the references are more general (as you might expect).
    It might be a good idea to start with the <a href="/overview/">Datadog Overview</a>, which explains Datadog’s
capabilities at a high level.</p>
<p><strong>Search for it!</strong> If you know roughly what you are looking for, enter it in the search box on the top left of the sidebar.</p>
<p><strong>If you have questions, we’re here to help.</strong> You can get in touch with
    our support team by mentioning @support-datadog in a comment on Datadog itself, or by
    <a href="/help/#email">email</a>, on <a href="/help/#slack">Slack</a>, or on our <a href="https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">customer service site</a>.</p>
