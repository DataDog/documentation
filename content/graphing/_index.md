Graphs are the window onto your monitored systems. Most of the times that you visit Datadog, you will look at [dashboards][8] made up of graphs. Other times you will see email notifications that include a graph of some fluctuation in the system. And yet other times you will see graphs in your Slack, HipChat, and other chat clients documenting the changes in metrics over the course of time. Graphs are at the heart of monitoring and observability, so it is essential to understand how to define great graphs.

## The Graphing Editor
There are two ways to interact with the Graphing Editor: using the GUI (the default method) and writing JSON (the more complete method). This page covers using the GUI. To learn more about using JSON, visit the [JSON Graphing Primer Page][1]

On each graph you will find a pencil icon that opens the graph editor.


{{< img src="graphing/index/references-graphing-overview.png" alt="Graphing Overview" responsive="true" popup="true" >}}

The graphing editor has three tabs, **Share**, **JSON**, and **Edit**. **Share** will allow you to embed the graph on any external web page (Note: The share tab is only available on Timeboards.). **JSON** is the more flexible editor, but it requires knowledge of the graph definition language to make use of it. **Edit** is the default tab and will allow you to use a GUI to select the graphing options. The newest features are sometimes only available on the **JSON** tab.

## Editing graphs

When you first open the graphing editor window, you will be on the **Edit** tab. Here you can use the UI to choose most settings to tweak your graphs. Here is an example of what you might see. This example comes from the first graph in the standard Postgres Integration dashboard:

Configuring a graph is a multi-step process. 

1. Choose the metric
1. Select the visualization
1. Filter 
1. Aggregate and Rollup
1. Apply additional functions
1. Title the graph

### Choose the Metric to graph

When you create a graph, you will probably have a metric in mind that you want to show. You can select that in the first dropdown in the **Choose metrics and events** section. If you aren't sure exactly which metric to use, you might want to start with the [Metrics Explorer][2] or a [Notebook][7]. You can also look in the [Metrics Summary][3].

The Metrics Explorer will allow you to play around with different graph settings in a more ad-hoc way. The Metrics Summary will allow to learn more about the type of metric as well as setting the default unit for a metric.


### Select your visualization

Once you have a metric in mind to display in your graph, select your visualization.

Find the list of all visualizations [here][4]

### Filter and Aggregate to show what you need

#### Filter

Now that you have the metric and a visualization in place, you can filter down the hosts to be graphed. To the right of the metric is a dropdown which by default says *(everywhere)*. Click this and choose the tag(s) you want to filter by. To learn more about tags, refer to the [Guide to Tagging][5].

#### Aggregation Method

Next to the filter dropdown is the aggregation method. This defaults to **avg by** but can be changed to **max by**, **min by**, or **sum by**. In most cases, the metric will have many values for each time interval, coming from many hosts or instances. The aggregation method chosen determines how the metrics will be aggregated into a single line. So if you are graphing a metric that is from 100 hosts, **sum by** will add up all of those values and display the sum.

#### Aggregation Groups

After the aggregation method you can determine what constitutes a line or grouping in a graph. If you choose host, then you will have a line (in the case of line graphs) for each host. If you choose role, then there is a line for every role. Then that line will be made up of metrics from all the hosts in that role, aggregated using the method you chose above.

### Rollup to aggregate over time

Regardless of the options chosen above, there will always be some aggregation of data due to the physical size constraints of the window holding the graph. If a metric is updated every second and you are looking at 4 hours of data, you will need 14,400 points to display everything. Each graph we display will have about 300 points shown at any given time.

In the example above, each point displayed on the screen represents 48 data points. In practice, metrics are collected by the agent every 15-20 seconds. So one day's worth of data is 4,320 data points. You might consider a rollup function that looks at 5 or 10 minutes worth of data if you would like to have more control over the display of your data for a graph that shows 1 day.

To use the rollup function, click the plus sign to the right of the aggregation group and choose rollup from the dropdown. Now choose how you want to aggregate the data and the interval in seconds.

To create a single line that represents the total available disk space on average across all machines rolled up in 60 seconds buckets, you would use a query like this:


{{< img src="graphing/index/references-graphing-rollup-example.png" alt="rollup example" responsive="true" popup="true" >}}

When switching to the JSON view, the query will look like this:

    "q": "avg:system.disk.free{*}.rollup(avg, 60)"

For more about using the JSON view, visit the [JSON Graphing Primer page][1].

### Apply more advanced functions

Depending on your analysis needs, you may choose to apply other mathematical functions to the query. Examples include rates and derivatives, smoothing, and more. For a list of available functions [click here][6]

### Perform metric arithmetic

The Datadog UI supports the ability to graph your metrics with various arithmetic options. You can utilize any of: +, -, /, * to modify the values that are displayed on your graphs. This syntax allows for both integer values as well as arithmetic using multiple metrics.

#### Metric Arithmetic Using an Integer

You can modify how a metric value is displayed on a graph by performing an arithmetic operation on the metric. 
For example, if you would like to visualize the double of a specific metric, say `system.load.5`:


{{< img src="graphing/index/arithmetic_1.png" alt="Arithmetic 1" responsive="true" popup="true" >}}

This can be done inside a graph editor by clicking on the Graph Editor and selecting "advanced...". From there you can enter your arithmetic in the `Graph these queries as` box. In this case: a * 2. 

{{< img src="graphing/index/arithmetic_2.png" alt="Arithmetic 2" responsive="true" popup="true" >}}

#### Arithmetic between two Metrics

If you would like to visualize the percentage of `jvm.heap_memory` used, you can perform the following arithmetic across two metrics already being reported to your Datadog application: 

`jvm.heap_memory / jvm.heap_memory_max`

This can be done in the same manner as above, utilizing the "advanced..." option in the Graph Editor. From there, you can select `add a metric to this expression`. 

Once you have added all of the metrics you would like to visualize, you will notice they are each assigned a letter: the first metric is represented by a, the second metric is represented b, and so on. 
Then in the `Graph these queries as` box, you can enter the arithmetic you would like, in this case: `( a / b )`

{{< img src="graphing/index/arithmetic_3.png" alt="Arithmetic 3" responsive="true" popup="true" >}}

### Set Y-axis scale

By default, the Y-axis for your graph is set to linear with the minimum and maximum automatically set based on the values in the data and including zero. To make changes to the Y-axis, click the button **Show Y-Axis Controls**. Now you can change the scale from linear to log, pow, or sqrt. Next you can choose the minimum or maximum, and select whether zero should always be shown or not.

### Overlay events for additional context

You can repeat all the steps above to add additional metrics to your graph to add context. You can also add events from related system to add even more context. So an example would be to add github commits, Jenkins deploys, or Docker creation events. Just click the Overlay Events button and enter a query to find and display your events. To show anything from a source such as Github, use `sources:github`. For all the events with the tag role:web, use `tag:role:web`.


### Create a title

If you don't enter a title, we will automatically generate a title based on the selections you have made. But it may be more useful to the users of the dashboard to create a title that more aptly describes the purpose of the graph. Linking the technical purpose to the business benefits adds even more value.

### Save

The final step is to click Save. You can always come back in to the editor and tweak the graph further depending on your needs.

## Next Steps
Now that you know how to build graphs, look into using them in [Dashboards][8], discovering new metrics in the []
