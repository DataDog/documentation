title: Why am I unable to iFrame certain https URLs?
kind: faq
---

The issue most likely has to do with the headers set on the URL page, specifically `X-Frame-Options:`.

To allow Datadog to iFrame that URL, run a curl on that URL to check the value of that field, and modify **DENY** or **SAMEORIGIN** to **ALLOW-FROM <uri>**, which permits the specified 'uri' to frame this page.

Using `https://ozcruising.fogbugz.com/login` as an example:

```
curl -I -X GET https://ozcruising.fogbugz.com/login
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000

```

This header is set on the OzCruising side, and is a security measure that is intended to tell browsers not to allow the page to be loaded in an iframe on another site.
