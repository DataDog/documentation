There are two ways to share a graph or screenboard: 

* In a time board, pick a graph on a dashboard and click on the pencil to edit it. Under step 2, "Choose metrics and events," you’ll find the “share” tab that will generate an IFRAME of just that graph.
* In a custom screenboard, click the settings cog in the upper right of the screen, then click the "Generate public URL" option. This will create a URL which gives live and read-only access to just the contents of that screenboard.
