There are two ways to interact with the Graphing Editor: using the GUI (the default method) and writing JSON (the more complete method). This page covers using the GUI. To learn more about using JSON, visit the [JSON Graphing Primer Page][1]

## Find the Graph Editor
{: #editor}

On each graph you will find a pencil icon that opens the graph editor.

![Graphing Overview](/static/images/references-graphing-overview.png)

The graph editor has three tabs, **Share**, **JSON**, and **Edit**. **Share** will allow you to embed the graph on any external web page. **JSON** is the more flexible editor, but it requires knowledge of the graph definition language to make use of it. **Edit** is the default tab and will allow you to use a GUI to select the graphing options. The newest features are sometimes only available on the **JSON** tab.




## Graphing with the graphical editor interface

When you first open the graph editor window, you will be on the **Edit** tab. Here you can use the UI to choose most settings to tweak your graphs. Here is an example of what you might see. This example comes from the first graph in the standard Postgres Integration dashboard:

Configuring a graph in a dashboard is a multi-step process. The first two steps depend

### 1) Choose the Metric to graph

When you create a graph, you will probably have a metric in mind that you want to show. You can select that in the first dropdown in the **Choose metrics and events** section. If you aren't sure exactly which metric to use, you might want to start with the [Metrics Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/explorer). You can also look in the [Metrics Summary](https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/summary).

The Metrics Explorer will allow you to play around with different graph settings in a more ad-hoc way. The Metrics Summary will allow to learn more about the type of metric as well as setting the default unit for a metric.


### 2) Select your visualization

Once you have a metric in mind to display in your graph, select your visualization.

#### Timeseries

The Timeseries visualization is great for showing one or more metrics over time. The time window depends on what is selected on the timeboard or in the graph on a screenboard. Timeseries' can be displayed as lines, areas, and bars. To see an example of a timeseries graph, [click here](#collapseTimeseries){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTimeseries" }. Timeseries is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseTimeseries" markdown="1">
  ![Timeseries](/static/images/references-graphing-timeseries-example.png)
</div>

#### Heatmap

The Heatmap visualization is great for showing metrics aggregated across many tags, such as *hosts*. The more hosts that have a particular value, the darker that square will be. To see an example of a heatmap, [click here](#collapseHeatmap){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseHeatmap" }. Heatmap is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseHeatmap" markdown="1">
  ![Heatmap](/static/images/references-graphing-heatmap-example.png)
</div>

#### Distribution

The Distribution visualization is another way of showing metrics aggregated across many tags, such as *hosts*. Unlike the Heatmap, Distribution's x-axis is the quantity rather than time. To see an example of a distribution graph, [click here](#collapseDistribution){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseDistribution" }. Distribution is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseDistribution" markdown="1">
  ![Distribution](/static/images/references-graphing-distribution-example.png)
</div>


#### Toplist

The Toplist visualization is perfect when you want to see the list of hosts with the most or least of any metric value, such as highest consumers of CPU, hosts with the least disk space, etc. To see an example of a Toplist,  [click here](#collapseTopList){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTopList" }. Toplist is available on both timeboards and screenboards.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseTopList" markdown="1">
  ![TopList](/static/images/references-graphing-toplist-example.png)
</div>


#### Change

The Change graph will show you the change in a value over the time period chosen. To see an example of a Change graph, [click here](#collapseChangegraph){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseChangegraph" }.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseChangegraph" markdown="1">
  ![Changegraph](/static/images/references-graphing-change-example.png)
</div>

#### Hostmap

The Hostmap will graph any metric for any subset of hosts on the same hostmap visualization available from the main Infrastructure Hostmap menu. To see an example of a Hostmap, [click here](#collapseHostmap){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseHostmap" }.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseHostmap" markdown="1">
  ![Hostmap](/static/images/references-graphing-hostmap-example.png)
</div>


### 3) Filter and Aggregate to show what you need

#### Filter

Now that you have the metric and a visualization in place, you can filter down the hosts to be graphed. To the right of the metric is a dropdown which by default says *(everywhere)*. Click this and choose the tag(s) you want to filter by. To learn more about tags, refer to the [Guide to Tagging](/guides/tagging/).

#### Aggregation Method

Next to the filter dropdown is the aggregation method. This defaults to **avg by** but can be changed to **max by**, **min by**, or **sum by**. In most cases, the metric will have many values for each time interval, coming from many hosts or instances. The aggregation method chosen determines how the metrics will be aggregated into a single line. So if you are graphing a metric that is from 100 hosts, **sum by** will add up all of those values and display the sum.

#### Aggregation Groups

After the aggregation method you can determine what constitutes a line or grouping in a graph. If you choose host, then you will have a line (in the case of line graphs) for each host. If you choose role, then there is a line for every role. Then that line will be made up of metrics from all the hosts in that role, aggregated using the method you chose above.

### 4) Rollup to aggregate over time

Regardless of the options chosen above, there will always be some aggregation of data due to the physical size constraints of the window holding the graph. If a metric is updated every second and you are looking at 4 hours of data, you will need 14,400 points to display everything. Each graph we display will have about 300 points shown at any given time.

In the example above, each point displayed on the screen represents 48 data points. In practice, metrics are collected by the agent every 15-20 seconds. So one day's worth of data is 4,320 data points. You might consider a rollup function that looks at 5 or 10 minutes worth of data if you would like to have more control over the display of your data for a graph that shows 1 day.

To use the rollup function, click the plus sign to the right of the aggregation group and choose rollup from the dropdown. Now choose how you want to aggregate the data and the interval in seconds.

To create a single line that represents the total available disk space on average across all machines rolled up in 60 seconds buckets, you would use a query like this:

![rollup example](/static/images/references-graphing-rollup-example.png)

When switching to the JSON view, the query will look like this:

    "q": "avg:system.disk.free{*}.rollup(avg, 60)"

For more about using the JSON view, visit the [JSON Graphing Primer page][1].

### 5) Apply more advanced functions

Depending on your analysis needs, you may choose to apply other mathematical functions to the query. Examples include rates and derivatives, smoothing, and more. For a list of available functions, [click here](#collapseGraphicFunctionTable){: role="button" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseGraphicFunctionTable" }.

<div class="collapse" id="collapseGraphicFunctionTable" markdown="1">
<!-- The graphing functions section is a partial -->

<%= @items['/partials/graphingfunctions/'].compiled_content %>

</div>

### 6) Overlay events for additional context

You can repeat all the steps above to add additional metrics to your graph to add context. You can also add events from related system to add even more context. So an example would be to add github commits, Jenkins deploys, or Docker creation events. Just click the Overlay Events button and enter a query to find and display your events. To show anything from a source such as Github, use ```sources:github```. For all the events with the tag role:web, use ```tag:role:web```.


### 7) Create a title

If you don't enter a title, we will automatically generate a title based on the selections you have made. But it may be more useful to the users of the dashboard to create a title that more aptly describes the purpose of the graph. Linking the technical purpose to the business benefits adds even more value.

### 8) Save

The final step is to click Save. You can always come back in to the editor and tweak the graph further depending on your needs.
