## Usage metering

This API is currently in private beta. Python and Ruby clients are not yet supported.

The usage metering end-point allows you to:

* Get Hourly Usage For Hosts and Containers
* Get Hourly Usage For Custom Metrics
* Get Top Custom Metrics By Hourly Average

Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred. It is retained for the past 15 months.
