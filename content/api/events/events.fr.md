## Events
The events service allows you to programatically post events to the [event stream](/graphing/event_stream) and fetch events from the [event stream](/graphing/event_stream).

Events are limited to 4000 characters. If an event is sent out with a message containing more than 4000 characters only the 4000 first characters are displayed.
