This guide requires an Agent version >= 3.2.4. Older versions of the Agent do
not include the Service Checks.

OVERVIEW
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

In this guide, we will show you how you can setup some service checks
to monitor your service and to be notified when one goes down.

Service checks run in the Agent and are called in the main loop but will be 
processed in separate threads so they don't block the Agent.

A service check can be marked as either <b>UP</b> or <b>DOWN</b>.

Service checks will post an event on your stream when:

- The status of the service has changed.
- A service is DOWN on the first check.


<!--
======================================================
SETUP
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

If you have not already setup the Agent, then you should check out the Agent
setup instructions available at: <a href="http://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent">http://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent</a>.
This page will guide you through installing the Agent for your particular OS.

If you run into any issues during the setup, don't hesistate to pop by our
chat room, <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/datadog">#datadog on freenode</a>,
where we'll be happy to answer any questions you might have. (There's a 
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=datadog&prompt=1">
web chat client, too</a>.)

<!--
======================================================
CONFIGURATION
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="config">Configuration</h3>

There are currently two types of service checks:

- HTTP(S) checks
- TCP checks

As service checks are also Agent checks, they are configured <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/agent_checks/#config">the same way</a>.

Each check will have a configuration file that will be placed in the `conf.d`
directory. Configuration is written using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/). 

HTTP(S) Check configuration file must be named http_check.yaml
TCP Check configuration file must be named tcp_check.yaml.

<!--
======================================================
HTTP CHECK CONFIGURATION
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="http_config">HTTP Check Configuration</h3>



The HTTP(S) Check configuration file has the following structure:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-http_check-config.yaml") %>

<div class="alert alert-block">Note: Your YAML files must use spaces instead of tabs.</div>

#### init_config

The *notify* parameter (optional) in the *init_config* section allows you to 
chose which Datadog users will be notified when your service goes down 
or when your service recovers. If you have any additional integrations 
that support notifications (such as Pagerduty or Hipchat), you can notify 
them as well.

#### instances

The *instances* section is a list of instances that this check will be run
against with the needed parameters.

List of parameters:

- name <b>(mandatory)</b>: A name that must be unique across all your HTTP checks
- url <b>(mandatory)</b>: The url you want to monitor
- username (optional): If you want to test pages protected by a basic authentication.
- password (optional): If you want to test pages protected by a basic authentication.
- timeout (optional): A timeout for the request, defaulting to 10 seconds. 
A service will be marked as down if the request times out
- notify (optional): To override the global setting set in the *init_config* section.

#### Custom notifying:

You can also set-up your check to only trigger an error after a certain number of failures
have happend within a certain timeframe. Using the `window` and `threshold` parameters,
you can tell the alert to <em>only</em> trigger an alert if the check fails `x` times within
the last `y` attempts where `x` is the `threshold` and `y` is the `window`.

For example, if you have the following configuration for window and threshold:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-http_check-notify.yaml") %>

You will only be notified if the check fails 3 times within the last 5 tries.

<!--
======================================================
TCP CHECK CONFIGURATION
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="tcp_config">TCP Check Configuration</h3>

The TCP Check configuration file has the following structure:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-tcp_check-config.yaml") %>

#### init_config

The *notify* parameter (optional) in the *init_config* section allows you to 
chose which Datadog users will be notified when your service goes down 
or when your service recovers.
If you have installed the pagerduty integration or the hipchat integration, 
you can also notify them.

#### instances

The *instances* section is a list of instances that this check will be run
against with the needed parameters.

List of parameters:

- name <b>(mandatory)</b>: A name that must be unique across all your TCP checks
- host <b>(mandatory)</b>: The hostname or IP (v4 or v6) address you want to monitor
- port <b>(mandatory)</b>: The port on which the check will try to connect to
- timeout (optional): A timeout for the request, defaulting to 10 seconds. 
A service will be marked as down if the request times out
- notify (optional): To override the global setting set in the *init_config* section.

#### Custom notifying:

You can also set-up your check to only trigger an error after a certain number of failures
have happend within a certain timeframe. Using the `window` and `threshold` parameters,
you can tell the alert to <em>only</em> trigger an alert if the check fails `x` times within
the last `y` attempts where `x` is the `threshold` and `y` is the `window`.

For example, if you have the following configuration for window and threshold:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-tcp_check-notify.yaml") %>

You will only be notified if the check fails 3 times within the last 5 tries.
