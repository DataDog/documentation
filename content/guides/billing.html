<h4>Welcome to Datadog! We occasionally receive questions regarding the specifics
of our pricing; the basic plans and the most frequently seen questions can be
found below.</h4>

<br>
<h4><u>Basic Plan</u></h4>

There are three plans within Datadog:
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Free</strong> is only for 5 hosts or less. Free has a single day of data retention. The
good news is that switching from the Free plan to Pro will not affect your
setup, so anything you've begun monitoring would not be affected by that status
change.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pro</strong> is for 1-100 hosts and comes with 1 year of data retention.
Pro includes metric alerts and email support.
</li>
<li> <strong>Enterprise</strong> is for
100+ hosts or any number of hosts but needing custom adjustments to what is
offered in the Pro plan. Enterprise pricing is based on three factors:
  <ol>
   <li> Data retention requirements and number of custom metrics (base plan includes 1 year retention,
and 100 custom metrics)</li>
   <li>  Size of your environment in servers</li>
   <li>  Payment terms (month to month or annual prepaid)</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
For all plans, custom metrics and events are supported but limited to 100
metrics per host. Custom metrics refer to any metrics that are not part of our
regular integration suite, for example using custom checks or API-level metrics
in your application stack. To clarify, integrations that can potentially emit
an unlimited number of metrics to us can also count as custom metrics (e.g:
JMX / WMI / Nagios / Cacti).
</p>

<p>
Pro and Enterprise data retention is for one year at full resolution (maximum
is one point per second). For greater data retention needs, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@datadoghq.com">
sales@datadoghq.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Each invoice is determined by the high watermark of concurrently running hosts
for that month.</h5> This is per active host in Datadog, whether or not it's running
the agent.
</p>

<br>
<h4><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></h4>

<h5>Do you support hourly pricing?</h5>
<p>
We do support hourly pricing at $0.03 per hour per host or a hybrid
of monthly and hourly. Here is how that hybrid works:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
You tell us how many hosts you will run each month and we will bill you for that baseline number of
hosts at $15 per host (you can change this number at the beginning of each
month if you like). Then for any hosts beyond the committed number previously
determined, our billing system will charge you $0.03 per host per hour. This
works out to be much less expensive for extra hosts that may come up for a
short period, but a little bit more than monthly rates if you ran on an hourly
rate all the time (~$23/host/month).  The metering samples how many hosts are
reporting data once every hour, thus the minimum increment for an hourly server
is one hour. If that number exceeds your monthly commit, we just charge overage
for the excess hosts.
</p></blockquote>


<h5>Do non-reporting or inactive hosts count?</h5>
<p>
Non-reporting hosts (status '???') do not count towards billing. It might take
some time (up to 24 hours) for the hosts with the inactive status '???' to drop
out of the infrastructure view.
</p>

<p>
A transient server that you monitored in Datadog for a short period of time
will clear out of the infrastructure view after 24 hours of not reporting any
data. We will still however retain the historical data (for a paid account),
and you can graph it on a dashboard if you know the specific host by name (or
by its tags).
</p>

<h5>How will an AWS integration impact my monthly billing?</h5>
<p>
We bill for all hosts running the agent as well as any hosts picked up via the
AWS integration (not ELBs or other namespaces). You will not get double-charged
if you are running the agent on a host <b>AND</b> picking it up via AWS integration.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to control what metrics you are aggregating via AWS integration,
select 'limit metric collection for all accounts' in the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/amazon_web_services"> AWS Integration tile</a>
and customize accordingly.
</p>

<h5>How will a VMware integration impact my monthly billing?</h5>
<p>
  The base pricing is $15 per virtual machine per month. See above for more
  general information.
</p>

<h5>How do I see what I'll get charged for this current month?</h5>
<p>
There is not currently a way to see what the upcoming bill looks like; as an
admin you can check out past invoices
<a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing_history">here</a>.
</p>

<h5>Can I set a specific email address to receive invoices at?</h5>
<p>
You can set a specific email address to receive invoices, even if that address
is not a team member within Datadog (invoices@yourcompany.com)
<a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing">here</a>.
