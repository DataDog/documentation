title: Getting Started with DogStatsd
---

<p class="aside">
  This tutorial will walk you through instrumenting your application to send
  custom metrics to Datadog. If you need some help as you go, pop by our
  <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/datadog">IRC channel</a>.
</p>

The easiest way to get your custom metrics into Datadog is to send them to DogStatsd,
a metrics aggregation server bundled with the Datadog agent (in versions 3.0
and above).
DogStatsd implements the
<a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">Statsd</a>
protocol, along with a few extensions for special Datadog features.

## How It Works

DogStatsd accepts custom application metrics points over
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a>,
and then periodically aggregates and forwards the metrics to Datadog, where
they can be graphed on dashboards. Here's a pretty standard DogStatsd setup:
<p>

### Aggregation

DogStatsd's primary function is to aggregate many data points into a single
metric for a given interval of time (ten seconds by default). Let's walk through an
example to understand how this works.

Suppose you want to know how many times you are running a database query,
your application can tell DogStatsd to increment a counter each
time this query is executed. For example:

<%= python <<eof
def query_my_database():
    dog.increment('database.query.count')
    # Run the query ...
eof
%>

If this function is executed one hundred times in a flush interval (ten
seconds by default), it will send DogStatsd one hundred UDP packets that say
"increment the 'database.query.count' counter". DogStatsd will aggregate these
points into a single metric value - 100 in this case - and send it to the
server where it can be graphed.

This means expect DogStatsd to produce one point per metric per flush interval
while data is being submitted for that metric.

### Why UDP?

Like Statsd, DogStatsd receives points over UDP. UDP is good fit for application
instrumentation because it is a fire and
forget protocol. This means your application won't stop its actual work to wait for a
response from the metrics server, which is very important if the metrics
server is down or inaccessible.

## Set Up

Once you have the Datadog Agent up and running, grab a DogStatsd client for your
language and you'll be ready to start hacking. Any Statsd client will work
just fine, but using a Datadog Statsd client will give you a few extra features
(namely tags and histograms, but more on that later).

### DogStatsd Clients

- [Python](https://github.com/DataDog/dogstatsd-python)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/DataDog/dogstatsd-ruby)
- [PHP](https://github.com/anthroprose/php-datadogstatsd)

### Statsd Clients

- [Java](https://github.com/youdevise/java-statsd-client)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/sivy/node-statsd)

## Metrics

We'll walk through the types of metrics supported by DogStatsd in Python, but
the principles are easily translated into other languages.
DogStatsd supports the following types of metrics:

### Gauges

Gauges measure the value of a particular thing at a
particular time, like the amount of fuel in a car's gas tank or
the number of users connected to a system.

<%= python <<eof
dog.gauge('gas_tank.level', 0.75)
dog.gauge('users.active', 1001)
eof
%>

### Counters

Counters track how many times something happened, like the number of
database requests or page views.

<%= python <<eof
dog.increment('database.query.count')
dog.increment('page_view.count', 10)
eof
%>

### Histograms

Histograms track the statistical distribution of a set of values, like the
duration of a number of database queries or the size of files uploaded by users. Each
histogram will track the average, minimum, maximum and the 75th, 85th, 95th and
99th percentiles.

<%= python <<eof
dog.histogram('database.query.time', 0.5)
dog.histogram('file.upload.size', file.get_size())
eof
%>

Histograms are an extension to Statsd, so you'll need to use a client that
supports them.

### Timers

Statsd only supports histograms for timing, not generic values (like the size
of uploaded files or the number of rows returned from a query). Timers are
essentially a special case of histograms, so they are treated in the same manner
by DogStatsd for backwards compatibility.

## Sample Rates

The overhead of sending UDP packets can be too great for some performance
intensive code paths. To work around this, Statsd clients support sampling,
that is to say, only sending metrics a percentage of the time. For example:

<%= python <<eof
dog.histogram('my.histogram', 1, sample_rate=0.5)
eof
%>

will only be sent to the server about half of the time, but it will be
multipled by the sample rate to provide an estimate of the real data.

## Tags

Tags are a Datadog specific extension to Statsd. They allow you to tag a metric
with a dimension that's meaningful to you and slice and dice along that
dimension in your graphs. For example, if you wanted to measure the
performance of two video rendering algorithms, you could tag the rendering time
metric with the version of the algorithm you used.


Since tags are an extension to Statsd, so you'll need to use a client that
supports them.


<%= python <<eof

# Randomly choose which rendering function we want to use ...
if random() < 0.5:
    renderer = old_slow_renderer
    version = 'old'
else:
    renderer = new_shiny_renderer
    version = 'new'

start_time = time()
renderer()
duration = time() - start_time
dog.histogram('rendering.duration', tags=[version])
eof
%>

## Configuration

DogStatsd supports the following options, all of which can be tweaked in the
Agent <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/master/datadog.conf.example">
configuration file</a>:

    # The port DogStatsd runs on. If you change this, make your the apps sending to
    # it change as well.
    dogstatsd_port: 8125

    # The number of seconds to wait between flushes to the server.
    dogstatsd_interval: 10

## Datagram Format

If you want to send metrics to DogStatsd in your own way, here is the format of
the packets:

`metric.name:value|type|@sample_rate|#tag1:value,tag2`

Here's  breakdown of the fields:

- `metric.name` should be a String with no colons, bars or @ characters.
- `value` should be a number
- type should be `c` for Counter, `g` for Gauge, `h` for Histogram or `ms` for Timer.
- sample rate is optional and should be a float between 0 and 1 inclusive.
- tags are optional, and should be a comma seperated list of tags. colons are
  used for key value tags.

Here are some example datagrams and comments explaining them:

    # Increment the page.views counter.
    page.views:1|c

    # Record the fuel tank is half-empty
    fuel.level:0.5|g

    # Sample a the song length histogram half of the time.
    song.length:240|h|@0.5

    # Increment the users online counter tagged by country of origin.
    users.online:1|c|#country:china

    # An example putting it all together.
    users.online:1|c|@0.5|#country:china
