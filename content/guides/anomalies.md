Anomaly detection is an algorithmic feature that allows you to identify when a metric is behaving differently than it has in the past, taking into account day-of-week and time-of-day patterns. It's well suited for metrics with recurring patterns that are hard or impossible to monitor with threshold-based alerting. For example, anomaly detection can help you discover when your web traffic is unusually low on a weekday afternoon - even though that same level of traffic would be perfectly normal later in the evening.

## How to Use Anomaly Detection on Your Data

We've added a new query function called `anomalies` to our query language. When you apply this function to series, it returns the usual results along with an expected "normal" range.

Keep in mind that `anomalies` uses the past to predict what is expected in the future, so using `anomalies` on a new metric, for which you have just started collecting data, may yield poor results.

### 1. Visualize Anomalies in Dashboards
{: #dashboards}

The chart below shows a dashboard chart that uses anomaly detection. The grey band represents the region where the metric is expected to be based on past behavior. The blue and red line is the actual observed value of the metric; the line is blue when within the expected range and red when it is outside of the expected range.

To create an anomaly detection graph, start by adding a timeseries graph to your dashboard. As shown below, be sure to select "Timeseries" as the visualization type and select "lines" from the Display menu. Other visualization types do not yet support anomaly detection. In the chart editor window, you should see something like this:

<img src="/static/images/anomalies/initial_editor.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

Now, click on the + icon (Add functions and modifiers) on the right side of your expression. In the “Modify your query” box, choose the “anomalies” function:

<img src="/static/images/anomalies/function_menu.png" style="width:225px; border:1px solid #777777"/>

This will add anomaly detection to your expression, and you should immediately see the preview update to include the grey band. The function has two parameters. The first parameter is for selecting which algorithm will be used. The second parameter is labeled `bounds`, and you can tune this to change the width of the grey band. After successfully adding `anomalies`, your editor should show something like this:

### 2. Alert on Anomalies
{: #alerts}

In addition to viewing anomalies in dashboards, you may create monitors that trigger when metrics behave anomalously.

Start by navigating to the [New Monitor](https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors#/create) page and selecting Metric. Define the metric in step (1) just like you would for any other metric alert. In step (2), select "Anomaly Alert".

<img src="/static/images/anomalies/monitor_options.png" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #777777"/>

You should now see something like what's shown above, with a handful of selections that will help determine how sensitive you monitor is to different types of anomalies.

<ol type="a">
  <li>This number is equivalent to the <code>bounds</code> parameter used in the <code>anomalies</code> function in dashboards; it controls the width of the grey band.</li>
  <li>The "average distance" option will result in the monitor triggering faster for anomalies far outside of the expected band than for anomalies closer to the expected band. (Thresholds between 2 and 3 generally perform well.) The "percentage" option treats all observations outside of the expected band equally. </li>
  <li>If you only care about unusually high or unusually low values, you can choose to only alert on values above or below the bounds.</li>
  <li>As with other alerts, smaller time windows lead to faster alerting but can yield more false positives.</li>
  <li>You can change the anomaly detection algorithm used here.</li>
</ol>

Continue with steps (3) and (4) as you would for any other monitor.

### 3. Anomaly Detection Algorithms

We currently offer two different anomaly detection algorithms. Both algorithms will follow the seasonal pattern of the series, and
will not have their predictions be affected by short anomalies.

* Robust: This algorithm is very stable and its predictions will remain constant even through longer-term anomalies. On the other hand, it will take longer to respond to intended level shifts (e.g., if the level of a metric shifts due to a code change.) This algorithm uses more data and can take longer to load the first time it is run.

* Adaptive: This algorithm is more dynamic and will adjust its predictions to a metric's changes much more readily. On the other hand, it can be prone to following a metric too closely, which could lead to false negatives.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I use anomaly detection for everything?

No. Anomaly detection is designed to assist with visualizing and monitoring metrics that have predictable patterns. For example, `my_site.page_views` might be driven by user traffic and thus vary predictably by time of day and day of week. If your metric does not have any sort of repeated/predictable pattern, then a simple chart overlay or threshold alert might be better than anomaly detection.

Also, anomaly detection requires historical data to make good predictions. If you have only been collecting a metric for a few hours or a few days, anomaly detection probably won't be very useful.

### Why does an anomaly "disappear" when I zoom in?

At different zoom levels, the same query can result in time series with very different characteristics. When looking at longer time periods, each point represents the aggregate of many more-granular points. Therefore, each of these aggregate points may hide noise observed in the more granular points. For example, charts that show one week often appear smoother (less noisy) than charts that show just 10 minutes.

The width of the grey band that is drawn by our anomaly detection algorithm is, in part, based on the noisiness of the time series in the plot. The band must be wide enough that ordinary noise is mostly inside the band and doesn't appear as anomalous. Unfortunately, when the band is wide enough to include ordinary noise, it might also be wide enough to hide some anomalies, especially when viewing short time windows.

Here's a concrete example to illustrate. The `app.requests` metric is noisy but has a constant average value of 8. On one day, there is a 10-minute anomalous period, starting a 9:00, during which the metric has an average value of 10. The chart below shows this series in a graph with a one-day time window; each point in the graph summarizes 5 minutes.

<img src="/static/images/anomalies/disappearing_day.png" style="width:500px; border:1px solid #777777"/>

The grey band here makes sense; it is wide enough to capture the noise in the time series. Yet, it is narrow enough that the anomaly at 9:00 stands out clearly. This next chart shows a zoomed-in view of a half-hour time window that includes the 10-minute anomaly; each point in the graph summarizes 10 seconds.

<img src="/static/images/anomalies/disappearing_half_hour.png" style="width:500px; border:1px solid #777777"/>

Again, the band seems to be reasonably sized, because the non-anomalous data from 8:50 - 9:00 and from 9:10 - 9:20 is inside the band. A band any narrower would start to highlight normal data as anomalous. Notice the band in this graph is ~8x wider than the one in the previous graph. The anomalous period from 9:00 - 9:10 looks a little different from the rest of the series, but it is not extreme enough to fall outside of the band.

In general, if an anomaly disappears when you zoom in, this doesn't mean that it's not an anomaly. It means that, while the individual points in the zoomed-in view are not anomalous in isolation, the fact that many slightly unusual points occur together is anomalous.
