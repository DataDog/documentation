This guide assumes you are deploying an Azure Cloud Service.

### Install the Agent on instance startup

**Create** a file called `installDatadogAgent.cmd` with the following contents:


    set log=datadog-install.log
    set api_key=%1

    sc query | findstr DatadogAgent
    if ERRORLEVEL 1 (
        echo "Datadog Agent service not detected" >> %log%
        echo "Starting the installation" >> %log%

        if exist ddagent.msi (
            echo "Already has the installer" >> %log%
        ) else (
            echo "Fetching the Agent Installer" >> %log%
            powershell -Command "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://s3.amazonaws.com/ddagent-windows-stable/ddagent-cli.msi', 'ddagent.msi')"
        )

        echo "Starting the installer" >>%log%
        msiexec.exe /qn /i ddagent.msi APIKEY=%api_key% /L+ %log%
    ) else (
        echo "Agent already exists, skipping install" >>%log%
    )

    echo "Finished Install" >>%log%
    exit 0

If you are using Visual Studio, make sure that the file is included in the package: Set the *Copy to Output Directory* property of the file to *Copy Always* and make sure that the *Build Action* is *Content* .

**Add** the installation task to your `ServiceDefinition.csdef` file by adding the following in the `<Startup>` section:

    <Task commandLine="installDatadogAgent.cmd YOUR_API_KEY" executionContext="elevated" />


Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key found at [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api).


The created file will download and install the latest version of the Agent on application deploy.

### Deploy your app

You should now repackage your app's cloud service package file (*.cspkg), making sure to include the `installDatadogAgent.cmd` file in the package.
You can also directly upload from Visual Studio using the `Publish` button.

On deploy you should see your new hosts appear on your infrastructure overview:
