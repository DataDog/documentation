<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

This guide will outline the basic functionality of the Datadog Agent.
If you haven't installed the Agent yet, instructions can be found 
<a href='https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/windows'>here</a>.<br/>

Starting and Stopping the Agent
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="starting_and_stopping_the_agent">Starting and Stopping the Agent</h3>

The execution of the Agent is controlled by a Windows service. The Agent can be started, stopped, and
restarted from the Services panel. To view the Services panel, execute the following in a <code>cmd.exe</code> shell:

<%= console 'services.msc' %>

Once you're in the console, find the "Datadog Agent" service. 
Right clicking on the service will reveal options to start, stop, and restart the Agent.

======================================================
Status and Information
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="status_and_information">Status and Information</h3>

To check if the Agent is running, check if the service status in the Services panel is listed as "Started".
A process called "ddagent.exe" should also exist in the Task Manager.

To receive more information about the Agent's state, visit the following page in your web browser:

<%= console 'http://localhost:17125/status' %>

<!--
======================================================
Configuration
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

The configuration file location depends on the version of Windows on which the Agent is installed.

For Windows Server 2003, XP or older:
<ul>
    <li>Agent configuration: <br>
        <code>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Datadog\datadog.conf</code></li>
    <li>Integration configuration: <br>
        <code>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Datadog\conf.d\</code></li>
</ul>


For Windows Server 2008, Vista and newer:
<ul>
    <li>Agent configuration: <br>
        <code>C:\ProgramData\Datadog\datadog.conf</code></li>
    <li>Integration configuration: <br>
        <code>C:\ProgramData\Datadog\conf.d\</code></li>
</ul>

Troubleshooting

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

First, check if the Agent is running in the Services panel and in the Task Manager.

Next, try opening the <a href='#status_and_information'>status page</a> to see the state of the Agent.

Logs for the subsystems are available in Event Viewer, under Windows Logs &rarr; Application.
