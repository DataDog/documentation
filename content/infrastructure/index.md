## Overview

This view shows:

* All hosts monitored by your datadog applications
* You can see the tags applied to each machine; as they're assigned to
perform certain roles, tagging allows you to indicate machines have
a certain purpose
* We do as much as possible to automatically categorize your servers
for you, to create structure in your infrastructure with as little
work as possible (unlike explicitly creating all your clusters).
Thus if a new machine is tagged, you can immediately see the stats
for that machine based on what was previously set up for that tag.
* For more on tagging, please see <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/faq/#tagging">here</a>.
