# Paint colors mock data

This folder contains a collection of related configuration files and data structures. 

One YAML configuration or data structure should yield the next -- for example, when the customization config and frontmatter in this folder are combined, they should yield the filters manifest included in this folder. This allows testing of various functions that convert one data type to another.
