title: Alert
---

## Usage

- You can use Markdown and Markdoc tags inside of the `alert` tag.
- Some elements might look odd inside of alerts, because alerts have historically been simple and the relevant CSS styles have not been written. If needed, we can write additional CSS styles to support those elements.

## Types

### Info

{% alert level="info" %}
This is an info alert!
{% /alert %}

### Warning
    
{% alert level="warning" %}
This is a warning alert!
{% /alert %}

### Danger

{% alert level="danger" %}
This is a danger alert!
{% /alert %}

## Advanced example

{% alert level="info" %}
The contents of the `alert` tag are written in Markdoc, not HTML. This means that you can use Markdoc syntax within the `alert` tag, such as a reference-style [link][1]. 

Some elements might look odd inside of alerts, because we've never used them in this context before. If needed, we can write additional CSS styles to support those elements.
{% /alert %}
