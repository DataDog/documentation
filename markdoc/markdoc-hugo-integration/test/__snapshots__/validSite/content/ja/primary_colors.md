    This test page explores everyday items that are blue, yellow, or red --
    which also happen to be the primary colors of the color wheel. If this seems
    contrived and odd, that's only because test pages are often both of those
    things.

      <h3 id="ocean">Ocean</h3>
      <p>
        The ocean is a vast and expansive body of saltwater that covers
        approximately 70% of the Earth's surface. It plays a crucial role in
        regulating the planet's climate and weather patterns, as well as
        supporting a diverse array of marine life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ocean is a source of food, recreation, and transportation for
        humans, and its depths remain largely unexplored, holding many mysteries
        and wonders. The sight and sound of the ocean waves can evoke a sense of
        calm and tranquility, making it a popular destination for relaxation and
        reflection.

      <h3 id="sky">Sky</h3>
      <p>
        The sky is the expanse of atmosphere that we see when we look up from
        the Earth's surface. During the day, it appears blue due to the
        scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the air, a phenomenon known
        as Rayleigh scattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky changes color at sunrise and sunset, displaying beautiful hues
        of red, orange, and pink. It is home to various weather phenomena,
        including clouds, rainbows, and storms, and serves as the backdrop for
        celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars. The sky's vastness and
        ever-changing nature inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity.

        They are known for their versatility and comfort, making them a staple
        in wardrobes around the world.

      <p>

      <p>
        Blueberries are small, round fruits that are known for their sweet and

        delicious treats like muffins and pies.
