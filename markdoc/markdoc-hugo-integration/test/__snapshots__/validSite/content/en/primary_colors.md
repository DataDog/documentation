    <p>Warning: This is just a test page. It's not real.</p>

    This test page explores everyday items that are blue, yellow, or red --
    which also happen to be the primary colors of the color wheel. If this seems
    contrived and odd, that's only because test pages are often both of those
    things.

  <div class="cdoc__toggleable" data-if="7">
    <h2 id="blue-header-id-override">Blue</h2>
    <p>
      Blue is a calming and serene color that is often associated with
      tranquility, stability, and trust.

    <div class="cdoc__toggleable cdoc__hidden" data-if="3">
      <h3 id="ocean">Ocean</h3>
      <p>
        The ocean is a vast and expansive body of saltwater that covers
        approximately 70% of the Earth's surface. It plays a crucial role in
        regulating the planet's climate and weather patterns, as well as
        supporting a diverse array of marine life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ocean is a source of food, recreation, and transportation for
        humans, and its depths remain largely unexplored, holding many mysteries
        and wonders. The sight and sound of the ocean waves can evoke a sense of
        calm and tranquility, making it a popular destination for relaxation and
        reflection.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cdoc__toggleable" data-if="4">
      <h3 id="sky">Sky</h3>
      <p>
        The sky is the expanse of atmosphere that we see when we look up from
        the Earth's surface. During the day, it appears blue due to the
        scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the air, a phenomenon known
        as Rayleigh scattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sky changes color at sunrise and sunset, displaying beautiful hues
        of red, orange, and pink. It is home to various weather phenomena,
        including clouds, rainbows, and storms, and serves as the backdrop for
        celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars. The sky's vastness and
        ever-changing nature inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity.

    <div class="cdoc__toggleable cdoc__hidden" data-if="5">
      <h3 id="jeans">Jeans</h3>
      <p>
        Jeans are a type of durable clothing typically made from denim fabric.
        They are known for their versatility and comfort, making them a staple
        in wardrobes around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally designed as workwear for miners and laborers in the 19th
        century, jeans have evolved into a fashion icon, available in various
        styles, cuts, and colors. They can be dressed up or down, suitable for
        casual outings or more formal occasions. The durability and timeless
        appeal of jeans have made them a beloved garment for people of all ages.

      <h3 id="blueberry">Blueberry</h3>
      <p>
        Blueberries are small, round fruits that are known for their sweet and
        slightly tart flavor. They are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and
        fiber, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. Blueberries can be
        eaten fresh, added to cereals and yogurt, or used in baking to make
        delicious treats like muffins and pies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blueberries are also popular in smoothies and jams. The vibrant blue
        color of blueberries adds a visual appeal to dishes, and their health
        benefits make them a favorite among health-conscious individuals.
