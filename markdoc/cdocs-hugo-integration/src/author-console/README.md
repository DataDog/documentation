# Docs author console

The author console is a React/TypeScript/Vite app that builds as a single HTML file for easy inclusion in a variety of static sites (such as the one generated by Hugo). It's not a fully standalone package, as it imports some types from its parent package.

The author console exists solely for local debugging purposes, and should not be run in staging or production.

The console uses canned test data when built manually from inside this directory with `yarn run build` or `yarn run prod` (which is the same as `build` but automatically opens the app in the browser).

The console can use live data when built programmatically. The console's parent package, `cdocs-hugo-integration`, builds a new instance of the console with every local Markdoc build, passing any relevant errors and configuration to that instance.
