  - name: "JMX Beans"
    description: "The JMX integration enables collection of metrics, logs, and traces from JVM-based applications. For example, the JMX integration is already used for official integrations like Solr, Tomcat, Cassandra, and more. Metrics generated through JMX-based integrations not natively supported by Datadog are considered [custom metrics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/custom_metrics/)."

    description: "Submit custom metrics for business stats using [DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/) and the [API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/metrics/). Datadog Agent integrations are Python files querying for metrics. All Agent code is open source, so it's possible to write your own [custom Agent check](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/custom_checks/) or [custom Agent integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/integrations/). The [integrations-extras GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras) contains many community-developed custom integrations."

    description: "Use Log Management to view, monitor, and analyze the logs from your applications and infrastructure. The [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/logs/) provides advanced functionality for sending logs to your Datadog account, but you can also submit logs directly to the [Logs API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/)."

    description: "APM and Continuous Profiler provide out-of-the-box performance dashboards for web services, queues, and databases to monitor requests, errors, and latency. You can use the [Datadog Tracing Library](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/dd_libraries/) for your environment and language, whether you are [tracing a proxy](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/proxy_setup/) or tracing across [AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/distributed_tracing/) and hosts, using automatic instrumentation, dd-trace-api, or [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/open_standards/)."

    description: "The [Processes integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/process/) collects resource usage metrics for specific running processes on any host, such as CPU, memory, I/O, and others. Use [Live Process Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/process/) (which is like htop without having to SSH) to query across all your running processes."

  - name: "Endpoint"
    description: "Use the Agent-based [HTTP check](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/http_check/), or configure [Synthetic Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/) from the Datadog application to validate if an endpoint or URL is running and accessible. Use either option to test both public and private endpoints. Combine with [Service Level Objectives, or SLOs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/service_level_objectives/) to define clear targets for performance."

    description: "[Network Device Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/network_monitoring/devices/) enables you to collect [SNMP](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/snmp/) (Simple Network Management Protocol) metrics emitted from network devices, such as routers, switches, and printers. [Network Performance Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/network_monitoring/performance/) tracks all network traffic in and out of a host, providing visibility into your network traffic between services, containers, availability zones, and any other tag in Datadog. Connection data at the IP, port, and PID levels is aggregated into application-layer dependencies between meaningful `source` and `destination` endpoints."
