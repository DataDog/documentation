If you have any feedback, contact [Datadog support](https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/).**\n\nTo grant read access on log data at all, you must grant the `logs_read_data` permission.\nFrom there you can limit what data a role grants read access to by associating a Restriction Query with that role.\n\nA Restriction Query is a logs query that restricts which logs the `logs_read_data` permission grants read access to.\nFor users whose roles have Restriction Queries, any log query they make only returns those log events that also match\none of their Restriction Queries. This is true whether the user queries log events from any log-related feature, including\nthe log explorer, Live Tail, re-hydration, or a dashboard widget.\n\nRestriction Queries currently only support use of the following components of log events:\n\n- Reserved attributes\n- The log message\n- Tags\n\nThe recommended way to manage restricted read access on log data for customers with large or complicated organizational structures\nis to add a team tag to log events to indicate which team(s) own(s) them, and then to scope Restriction Queries to the appropriate\nvalues of the team tag. Tags can be applied to log events in many ways, and a log event can have multiple tags with the same key (like team)\nand different values—in this way the same log event can be visible to roles whose restriction queries are scoped to different team values.\n\nYou need an API and application key with Admin rights to interact with this endpoint."
