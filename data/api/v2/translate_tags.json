This is true whether the user queries log events from any log-related feature, including\nthe log explorer, Live Tail, re-hydration, or a dashboard widget.\n\nRestriction Queries currently only support use of the following components of log events:\n\n- Reserved attributes\n- The log message\n- Tags\n\nTo restrict read access on log data, add a team tag to log events to indicate which teams own them, and then scope Restriction Queries to the relevant values of the team tag. Tags can be applied to log events in many ways, and a log event can have multiple tags with the same key (like team) and different values. This means the same log event can be visible to roles whose restriction queries are scoped to different team values.\n\nYou need an API and application key with Admin rights to interact with this endpoint.\n\nSee [How to Set Up RBAC for Logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/guide/logs-rbac/?tab=api#restrict-access-to-logs) for details on how to add restriction queries."
