This is particularly useful when filtering by `evaluation_changed_at` or `resource_discovery_timestamp`. For example: `?filter[evaluation_changed_at]=>20123123121`.\n\nYou can also use the negation operator on strings. For example, use `filter[resource_type]=-aws*` to filter for any non-AWS resources.\n\nThe operator must come after the equal sign. For example, to filter with the `>=` operator, add the operator after the equal sign: `filter[evaluation_changed_at]=>=1678809373257`.\n\nQuery parameters must be only among the documented ones and with values of correct types. Duplicated query parameters (e.g. `filter[status]=low&filter[status]=info`) are not allowed.\n\n### Response\n\nThe response includes an array of finding objects, pagination metadata, and a count of items that match the query.\n\nEach finding object contains the following:\n\n- The finding ID that can be used in a `GetFinding` request to retrieve the full finding details.\n- Core attributes, including status, evaluation, high-level resource details, muted state, and rule details.\n- `evaluation_changed_at` and `resource_discovery_date` time stamps.\n- An array of associated tags.\n",
