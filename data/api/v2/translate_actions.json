This is particularly useful when filtering by `evaluation_changed_at` or `resource_discovery_timestamp`. For example: `?filter[evaluation_changed_at]=>20123123121`.\n\nYou can also use the negation operator on strings. For example, use `filter[resource_type]=-aws*` to filter for any non-AWS resources.\n\nThe operator must come after the equal sign. For example, to filter with the `>=` operator, add the operator after the equal sign: `filter[evaluation_changed_at]=>=1678809373257`.\n\nQuery parameters must be only among the documented ones and with values of correct types. Duplicated query parameters (e.g. `filter[status]=low&filter[status]=info`) are not allowed.\n\n### Additional extension fields\n\nAdditional extension fields are available for some findings.\n\nThe data is available when you include the query parameter `?detailed_findings=true` in the request.\n\nThe following fields are available for findings:\n- `external_id`: The resource external ID related to the finding.\n- `description`: The description and remediation steps for the finding.\n- `datadog_link`: The Datadog relative link for the finding.\n- `ip_addresses`: The list of private IP addresses for the resource related to the finding.\n\n### Response\n\nThe response includes an array of finding objects, pagination metadata, and a count of items that match the query.\n\nEach finding object contains the following:\n\n- The finding ID that can be used in a `GetFinding` request to retrieve the full finding details.\n- Core attributes, including status, evaluation, high-level resource details, muted state, and rule details.\n- `evaluation_changed_at` and `resource_discovery_date` time stamps.\n- An array of associated tags.",

The size of the page varies depending on the endpoint and cannot be modified. To automate the request of the next page, you can use the links section in the response.\n\nThis endpoint will return paginated responses. The pages are stored in the links section of the response:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"data\": [...],\n  \"meta\": {...},\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": \"https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities\",\n    \"first\": \"https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities?page[number]=1&page[token]=abc\",\n    \"last\": \"https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities?page[number]=43&page[token]=abc\",\n    \"next\": \"https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities?page[number]=2&page[token]=abc\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n- `links.previous` is empty if the first page is requested.\n- `links.next` is empty if the last page is requested.\n\n#### Token\n\nVulnerabilities can be created, updated or deleted at any point in time.\n\nUpon the first request, a token is created to ensure consistency across subsequent paginated requests.\n\nA token is valid only for 24 hours.\n\n#### First request\n\nWe consider a request to be the first request when there is no `page[token]` parameter.\n\nThe response of this first request contains the newly created token in the `links` section.\n\nThis token can then be used in the subsequent paginated requests.\n\n*Note: The first request may take longer to complete than subsequent requests.*\n\n#### Subsequent requests\n\nAny request containing valid `page[token]` and `page[number]` parameters will be considered a subsequent request.\n\nIf the `token` is invalid, a `404` response will be returned.\n\nIf the page `number` is invalid, a `400` response will be returned.\n\nThe returned `token` is valid for all requests in the pagination sequence. To send paginated requests in parallel, reuse the same `token` and change only the `page[number]` parameter.\n\n### Filtering\n\nThe request can include some filter parameters to filter the data to be retrieved. The format of the filter parameters follows the [JSON:API format](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering): `filter[$prop_name]`, where `prop_name` is the property name in the entity being filtered by.\n\nAll filters can include multiple values, where data will be filtered with an OR clause: `filter[title]=Title1,Title2` will filter all vulnerabilities where title is equal to `Title1` OR `Title2`.\n\nString filters are case sensitive.\n\nBoolean filters accept `true` or `false` as values.\n\nNumber filters must include an operator as a second filter input: `filter[$prop_name][$operator]`. For example, for the vulnerabilities endpoint: `filter[cvss.base.score][lte]=8`.\n\nAvailable operators are: `eq` (==), `lt` (<), `lte` (<=), `gt` (>) and `gte` (>=).\n\n### Metadata\n\nFollowing [JSON:API format](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta), object including non-standard meta-information.\n\nThis endpoint includes the meta member in the response. For more details on each of the properties included in this section, check the endpoints response tables.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"data\": [...],\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"total\": 1500,\n    \"count\": 18732,\n    \"token\": \"some_token\"\n  },\n  \"links\": {...}\n}\n```\n### Extensions\n\nRequests may include extensions to modify the behavior of the requested endpoint. The filter parameters follow the [JSON:API format](https://jsonapi.org/extensions/#extensions) format: `ext:$extension_name`, where `extension_name` is the name of the modifier that is being applied.\n\nExtensions can only include one value: `ext:modifier=value`.",
