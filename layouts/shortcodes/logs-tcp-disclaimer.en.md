<div class="alert alert-warning">TCP log collection is <strong>not supported</strong>. Datadog provides <strong>no delivery or reliability guarantees</strong> when using TCP, and log data may be lost without notice.
For reliable ingestion, use the HTTP intake endpoint, an official Datadog Agent, or forwarder integration instead. For more information, see <a href="/logs/log_collection/?tab=host">Log Collection</a>.</div>
