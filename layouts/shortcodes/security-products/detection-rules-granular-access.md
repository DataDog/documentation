1. Click the vertical three-dot menu for the rule and select **Permissions**.
1. Click **Restrict Access**. The dialog box updates to show that members of your organization have **Viewer** access by default. Use that dropdown menu to select one or more roles, teams, or users that may edit the security rule.
1. Use the dropdown menu to select one or more roles, teams, or users that may edit the security rule.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Click **Save**.

**Note:** To maintain your edit access to the rule, Datadog requires you to include at least one role that you are a member of before saving.

To restore access to a rule:
