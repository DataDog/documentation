By default, all users have view and edit access to [suppressions][201]. To use granular access controls to limit the roles that may edit a suppression rule:

1. Click the vertical three-dot menu for the rule and select **Permissions**.
1. Click **Restrict Access**. The dialog box updates to show that members of your organization have **Viewer** access by default. Use that dropdown menu to select one or more roles, teams, or users that may edit the suppression rule.
1. Click **Add**.
1. Click **Save**.

**Note**: To maintain your edit access to the rule, Datadog requires you to include at least one role that you are a member of before saving.

To restore access to a rule:

1. Click the vertical three-dot menu for the rule and select **Permissions**.
1. Click **Restore Full Access**.
1. Click **Save**.
