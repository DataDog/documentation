### Manually track RUM resources

You can manually track RUM resources:

```javascript
DdRum.startResource('<res-key>', 'GET', 'http://www.example.com/api/v1/test', {}, Date.now());
//...
DdRum.stopResource('<res-key>', 200, 'xhr', (size = 1337), {}, Date.now());
```

### Manually send spans

You can send spans manually:

```javascript
const spanId = await DdTrace.startSpan('foo', { custom: 42 }, Date.now());
//...
DdTrace.finishSpan(spanId, { custom: 21 }, Date.now());
```

## Resource timings

Resource tracking provides the following timings:

-   `First Byte`: The time between the scheduled request and the first byte of the response. This includes time for the request preparation on the native level, network latency, and the time it took the server to prepare the response.
-   `Download`: The time it took to receive a response.
