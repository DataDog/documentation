Configure how often you want to keep updating the same signal if new values are detected within a specified time frame. For example, the same signal updates if any new value is detected within 1 hour, for a maximum duration of 24 hours.
- After a signal is generated, the signal remains "open" if a case is matched at least once within the `keep alive` window. Each time a new event matches any of the cases, the *last updated* timestamp is updated for the signal.
- A signal closes after the time exceeds the `maximum signal duration`, regardless of the query being matched. This time is calculated from the first seen timestamp.
- **Note**: The `evaluation window` must be less than or equal to the `keep alive` and `maximum signal duration`.
