Use unit testing to test your rules against sample logs and make sure the detection rule is working as expected. This can be helpful when you are creating a detection rule for an event that hasn't happened yet, so you don't have actual logs for it.

For example, if you have logs with a `login_attempt` field and want to detect logs with `login_attempt:failed`, but you only have logs with `login_attempt:success`. To test the rule, you can construct a sample log by copying a log with `login_attempt:success` and changing the `login_attempt` field to `failed`.
