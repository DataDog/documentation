Optionally, add a suppression rule to prevent a signal from getting generated. For example, if a user `john.doe` is triggering a signal, but their actions are benign and you do not want signals triggered from this user, add the following query into the **Add a suppression query** field: `@user.username:john.doe`.

Additionally, in the suppression rule, you can add a log exclusion query to exclude logs from being analyzed. These queries are based on **log attributes**. **Note**: The legacy suppression was based on log exclusion queries, but it is now included in the suppression rule's **Add a suppression query** step.
