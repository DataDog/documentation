    - The ASCII lowercase query labels are referenced in this section. An example rule condition for query `a` is `a > 3`.
    - **Note**: The query label must precede the operator. For example, `a > 3` is allowed; `3 < a` is not allowed.
1. (Optional) In the **Add notify** section, click **Add Recipient** to configure [notification targets][101].
