Joining together logs that span a time frame can increase the confidence or severity of the security signal. For example, to detect a successful brute force attack, both successful and unsuccessful authentication logs must be correlated for a user.

The detection rule joins the logs together using a `group by` value. The `group by` values are typically entities (for example, IP address or user), but can be any attribute.
