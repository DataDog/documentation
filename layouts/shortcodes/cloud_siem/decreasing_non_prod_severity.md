One way to decrease signal noise is to prioritize production environment signals over non-production environment signals. Select the `Decrease severity for non-production environments` checkbox to decrease the severity of signals in non-production environments by one level from what is defined by the rule case.

| Signal Severity in Production Environment| Signal Severity in Non-production Environment|
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Critical                                 | High                                         |
| High                                     | Medium                                       |
| Medium                                   | Info                                         |
| Info                                     | Info                                         |

The severity decrement is applied to signals with an environment tag starting with `staging`, `test`, or `dev`.
