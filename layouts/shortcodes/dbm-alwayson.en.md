**Note: For AlwaysOn users, the recommended approach is to install the Agent on each individual replica, which will help provide related infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, networking) for each replica**. Telemetry for the relevant availability groups will be collected from each replica the agent is connected to. As a fallback method, the Agent can be installed on a separate server and connected to the cluster through the listener endpoint, but this will make it impossible to relate infrastructure metrics for the underlying host.
