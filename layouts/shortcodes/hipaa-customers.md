Datadog will sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with customers that transmit protected health information (ePHI) via Datadog's Log Management Service.

These features are not available to customers who have signed Datadog's BAA:

* Users cannot request support through chat.
* You cannot [share][501] logs, security signals, or traces from the Datadog explorer.

If you have any questions about how the Log Management Service satisfies the applicable requirements under HIPAA, contact your account manager. HIPAA-enabled customers do not need to use specific endpoints to submit logs to enforce specific encryptions. The encryptions are enabled on all log submission endpoints.
