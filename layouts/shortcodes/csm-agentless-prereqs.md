## Prerequisites

To deploy Agentless scanning in your AWS environment, in addition to having [Cloud Security Management][3] enabled, you must enable Remote Configuration.

### Enable Remote Configuration

[Remote Configuration][1] is required to allow Datadog to send information to Agentless scanners, such as which cloud resources should be scanned. To enable Remote Configuration for your organization, navigate to your [Organization Settings in Datadog][4] and follow [steps 1-4][2] in the Remote Configuration docs.

**Note**: Only CSM-enabled AWS accounts that have scanners deployed need Remote-config enabled API keys.

### Permissions

**Note**: The following are permissions required for Agentless scanning, and are applied automatically as a part of the installation process.

####  IAM permissions (host and container permissions)

The Agentless Scanning instance requires the following IAM permissions to scan for hosts and containers:

```
ec2:DescribeVolumes

ebs:ListSnapshotBlocks
ebs:ListChangedBlocks
ebs:GetSnapshotBlock
```
