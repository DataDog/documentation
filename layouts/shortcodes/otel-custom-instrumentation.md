<div class="alert alert-info">Support for custom instrumenting your application using the OpenTelemetry API and sending the spans to Datadog is in beta.</div>

If your code is custom instrumented with the [OpenTelemetry (OTel) API][101], you can configure it to generate Datadog-style spans and traces to be processed by the Datadog tracing library for your language, and send those to Datadog. 

The Datadog tracing library, when configured as described here, accepts the spans and traces generated by OTel-instrumented code, processes the telemetry, and sends it to Datadog. You can use this approach, for example, if your code has already been instrumented with the OTel API, or if you want to instrument using the OTel API, and you want to gain the benefits of using the Datadog tracing libraries without changing your code.

If you're looking for a way to instrument your code with OpenTelemetry and then send span data to Datadog _without going through the Datadog tracing library_, see [OpenTelemetry in Datadog][102].
