* Notify an active Datadog user by email with `@<DD_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS>`. 

    **Note**: An email address associated with a pending Datadog user invitation or a disabled user is considered inactive and does not receive notifications.
* Notify any non-Datadog user by email with `@<EMAIL>`.

    **Note**: If emails are missing, blocklist, ip or domain filtering, spam filtering, or email security tools may be the issue.
