* Notify an active Datadog user by email with `@<DD_USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS>`. 

    **Note**: An email address associated with a pending Datadog user invitation or a disabled user is considered inactive and does not receive notifications. Blocklists, IP or domain filtering, spam filtering, or email security tools may also cause missing notifications. 
* Notify any non-Datadog user by email with `@<EMAIL>`.
