  Remote configuration for Observability Pipelines is in private beta. Contact <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/">Datadog support</a> or your Customer Success Manager for access.
</div>

If you are enrolled in the private beta of [Remote Configuration][101], you can remotely roll out changes to your Workers from the Datadog UI, rather than make updates to your pipeline configuration in a text editor and then manually rolling out your changes. Choose your deployment method when you create a pipeline and install your Workers.

See [Updating deployment modes](#updating-deployment-modes) on how to change the deployment mode after a pipeline is deployed.
