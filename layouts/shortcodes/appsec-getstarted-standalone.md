## Prerequisites

- The [Datadog Agent][101] is installed and configured for your application's operating system or container, cloud, or virtual environment. 
- If your service is running with [an Agent with Remote Configuration enabled and a tracing library version that supports it][102], you can block attackers from the Datadog UI without additional configuration of the Agent or tracing libraries.
