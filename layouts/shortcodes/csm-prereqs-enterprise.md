**Notes:**

- [CSM Threats on Windows is available in beta][108].
- Custom kernel builds are not supported.
- For compatibility with a custom Kubernetes network plugin like Cilium or Calico, see the [Troubleshooting page][102].
- Data collection is done using eBPF, so Datadog minimally requires platforms that have underlying Linux kernel versions of 4.15.0+ or have eBPF features backported.

### CSM Identity Risks

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note</strong>: At this time, CSM Identity Risks is available for AWS only.</div>

To use CSM Identity Risks, you must [enable resource collection for AWS][105]. If you've already done this, no additional setup is required.

**Notes**: 

- If you've [enabled CSM Misconfigurations for your AWS accounts][106], you already have cloud resource collection enabled.
- Although not required, when you [enable CloudTrail logs forwarding][107], you get additional insights based on the actual usage (or non-usage) of resources in your infrastructure, for example, users and roles with significant gaps between provisioned and used permissions.
