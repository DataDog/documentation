### Set up the Datadog Google Cloud Platform integration

The Datadog Google Cloud Platform integration uses service accounts to create an API connection between Google Cloud and Datadog. To enable metric collection, create a service account, and then provide Datadog with the service account credentials to begin making API calls on your behalf. For step-by-step instructions, see [Create your Google Cloud service account][12].

**Note**: [Google Cloud billing][4], the [Cloud Monitoring API][5], the [Compute Engine API][6], and the [Cloud Asset API][7] must all be enabled for the projects you wish to monitor.

#### Datadog

1. In Datadog, navigate to the [**Google Cloud Platform Integration**][9] page.
2. On the **Configuration** tab, locate the service account and select **Upload Private Key File** to integrate the project with Datadog.
3. Upload the JSON file, then click **Update Configuration**.
4. To monitor multiple projects, use one of the following methods:
    - Repeat the process above to use multiple service accounts.
    - Use the same service account by updating the `project_id` in the downloaded JSON file. Then, upload the file to Datadog as described in steps 1-3.

### Enable CSM for your Google Cloud projects

1. On the [**Cloud Security Management Setup**][2] page, click **Cloud Integrations**.
2. Expand the **GCP** section.
3. To enable resource scanning for a project, switch the **Resource Scanning** toggle to the on position.
4. To create a filter that excludes certain resources from being evaluated by CSM, click the **Plus** (+) icon under **Resource Evaluation Filters (Optional)**. For more information, see [Use Filters to Exclude Resources from Evaluation][11].
5. Click **Done**.
