In the **Set severity to** dropdown menu, select the appropriate severity level (`INFO`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`).

In the **Notify** section, optionally, configure [notification targets][101] for each rule case.

You can also create [notification rules][102] to avoid manual edits to notification preferences for individual detection rules.
