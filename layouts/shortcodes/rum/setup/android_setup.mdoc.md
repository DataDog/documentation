### Visualize your data

After your deployment is live, Datadog collects events from your users' browsers.

Visualize the [data collected][1] in [dashboards][2] or create a search query in Error Tracking.

Until Datadog starts receiving data, your application appears as `pending` on the **Applications** page.
