## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Real User Monitoring (RUM) for your application. RUM provides deep insight into your application's frontend performance and user experience across different platforms.

The Datadog Android SDK supports Android 5.0+ (API level 21) and Android TV.

## Setup

Make sure you've set up the [Android SDK][14].

### Visualize your data

After your deployment is live, Datadog collects events from your users' browsers.

Visualize the [data collected][1] in [dashboards][2] or create a search query in Error Tracking.

Until Datadog starts receiving data, your application appears as `pending` on the **Applications** page.
