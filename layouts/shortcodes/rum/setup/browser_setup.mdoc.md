## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Real User Monitoring (RUM) for your application. RUM provides deep insight into your application's frontend performance and user experience across different platforms.

### Install the Browser SDK

Make sure you've set up the [Browser SDK][3].

### Visualize your data

After your deployment is live, Datadog collects events from your users' browsers.

Visualize the [data collected][1] in [dashboards][2] or create a search query in Error Tracking.

Until Datadog starts receiving data, your application appears as `pending` on the **Applications** page.
