**Note: For AlwaysOn users with cloud-hosted instances, the recommended approach is to install the Agent on a remote instance and connect to each individual replica**. Telemetry for the relevant availability groups will be collected from each replica the agent is connected to. As a fallback method, the Agent can be installed on a separate server and connected to the cluster through the listener endpoint.
