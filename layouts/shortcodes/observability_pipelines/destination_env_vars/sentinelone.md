Enter your SentinelOne write access token. To find your write access token:

1. Log into the [S1 console][10061].
1. Navigate to the Singularity Data Lake (SDL) API Keys page. To access it from the console, click **Visibility** on the left menu to go to SDL. Click on your username and then **API Keys**.
1. Copy the **Logs Access** write key and paste it into the **SentinelOne Write Access Token** field on the **Install Observability Pipelines Worker** page.

After you've installed the Observability Pipelines Worker and finished setting up the pipeline, see [View logs in a SentinelOne cluster][10062] for instructions on how to see the logs you sent from Observability Pipelines to the SentinelOne destination.
