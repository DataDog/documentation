These are the defaults used for secret identifiers and environment variables.

**Note**: If you entered identifiers for your secrets and then choose to use environment variables, the environment variable is the identifier entered and prepended with `DD_OP`. For example, if you entered `PASSWORD_1` for a password identifier, the environment variable for that password is `DD_OP_PASSWORD_1`.
