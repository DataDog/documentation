<div class="alert alert-warning">If the Worker is ingesting logs that are not coming from the Datadog Agent and are shipped to an archive using the Observability Pipelines Datadog Archives destination, those logs are not tagged with <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_configuration/attributes_naming_convention/#reserved-attributes">reserved attributes</a>. In addition, logs rehydrated into Datadog will not have standard attributes mapped. This means that when you rehydrate your logs into Log Management, you may lose Datadog telemetry, the ability to search logs easily, and the benefits of <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging/?tab=kubernetes">unified service tagging</a> if you do not structure and remap your logs in Observability Pipelines before routing your logs to an archive.<br><br>For example, say your syslogs are sent to Datadog Archives and those logs have the <code>status</code> tagged as <code>severity</code> instead of the reserved attribute of <code>status</code> and the host tagged as <code>host-name</code> instead of the reserved attribute <code>hostname</code>. When these logs are rehydrated in Datadog, the status for each log is set to <code>info</code> and none of the logs have a hostname tag.
