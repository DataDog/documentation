To authenticate the Observability Pipelines Worker for Google Chronicle, contact your Google Security Operations representative for a Google Developer Service Account Credential. This credential is a JSON file and must be placed under `DD_OP_DATA_DIR/config`. See [Getting API authentication credential][10001] for more information.

**Note**: If you are installing the Worker in Kubernetes, see [Referencing files in Kubernetes][10004] for information on how to reference the credentials file.


To set up the Worker's Google Chronicle destination:

1. Enter the customer ID for your Google Chronicle instance.
1. Enter the path to the credentials JSON file you downloaded earlier.
1. Select **JSON** or **Raw** encoding in the dropdown menu.
1. Select the appropriate **Log Type** in the dropdown menu.

**Note**: Logs sent to the Google Chronicle destination must have ingestion labels. For example, if the logs are from a A10 load balancer, it must have the ingestion label `A10_LOAD_BALANCER`. See Google Cloud's [Support log types with a default parser][10003] for a list of available log types and their respective ingestion labels.
