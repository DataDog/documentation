#### Google Cloud Storage

1. Enter the name of the Google Cloud storage bucket you created earlier.
2. Select the storage class for the created objects.
3. Select the access level of the created objects.
4. Optionally, enter in the prefix. Prefixes are useful for partitioning objects. For example, you can use a prefix as an object key to store objects under a particular directory. If using a prefix for this purpose, it must end in `/` to act as a directory path; a trailing `/` is not automatically added.
5. Optionally, click **Add Header** to add metadata.
