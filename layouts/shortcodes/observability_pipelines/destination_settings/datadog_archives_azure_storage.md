#### Azure Storage

1. Enter the name of the Azure container you created earlier.
2. Optionally, enter in the prefix. Prefixes are useful for partitioning objects, such as by creating an object key that stores objects under a particular directory. If using a prefix for this purpose, it must end in `/` to act as a directory path. A trailing `/` is not automatically added.
3. Optionally, click **Add Header** to add metadata.
