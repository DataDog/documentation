#### Azure Storage

1. Enter the name of the Azure container you created earlier.
2. Optionally, enter a prefix. Prefixes are useful for partitioning objects. For example, you can use a prefix as an object key to store objects under a particular directory. If using a prefix for this purpose, it must end in `/` to act as a directory path; a trailing `/` is not automatically added.
3. Optionally, click **Add Header** to add metadata.
