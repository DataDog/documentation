### Connect the S3 bucket to Datadog Log Archives

1. Navigate to Datadog [Log Forwarding][201].
1. Click **Add a new archive**.
1. Enter a descriptive archive name.
1. Add a query that filters out all logs going through log pipelines so that none of those logs go into this archive. For example, add the query `observability_pipelines_read_only_archive`, assuming no logs going through the pipeline have that tag added.
1. Select **AWS S3**.
1. Select the AWS account that your bucket is in.
1. Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
1. Optionally, enter a path.
1. Check the confirmation statement.
1. Optionally, add tags and define the maximum scan size for rehydration. See [Advanced settings][202] for more information.
1. Click **Save**.

See the [Log Archives documentation][203] for additional information.
