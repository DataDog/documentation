<div class="alert alert-danger">If you upgrade your Observability Pipelines Workers 1.8 or earlier to 2.0 or later, your existing pipelines will break. Do not upgrade your Workers if you want to continue using the legacy Observability Pipelines. If you want to use Worker 2.0 or later, you must migrate your Worker 1.8 or earlier pipelines to Worker 2.x.<br><br>Datadog recommends you update to Observability Pipelines Worker (OPW) versions 2.0 or above. Upgrading to a major OPW version and keeping it updated is the only supported way to get the latest OPW functionality, fixes, and security updates. </div>
