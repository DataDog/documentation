- `Server Certificate Path`: The path to the certificate file that has been signed by your Certificate Authority (CA) Root File in DER or PEM (X.509).
- `CA Certificate Path`: The path to the certificate file that is your Certificate Authority (CA) Root File in DER or PEM (X.509).
- `Private Key Path`: The path to the `.key` private key file that belongs to your Server Certificate Path in DER or PEM (PKCS#8) format.
