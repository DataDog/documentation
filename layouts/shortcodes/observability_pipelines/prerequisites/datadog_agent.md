You already have the Datadog Agent installed to collect and route your logs to [Datadog Log Management][2001]. If you do not have Datadog Agents set up, see the [Datadog Agent documentation][2002] for more information.

You have the following information available:
- The Datadog Agent address, including the port, that your Observability Pipelines Worker will listen on for logs.
- A Datadog API key with [Remote Configuration enabled][2003].
- Your Datadog [`Site URL`][2004]. For example, `datadoghq.com` for the site `US1`.
