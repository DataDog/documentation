You already have the Datadog Agent installed to collect and route your logs to [Datadog Log Management][101]. If you do not have Datadog Agents set up, see [Datadog Agent documentation][102] for more information.

You have the following information available:
- The Datadog Agent address, including the port, that your Observability Pipelines Worker will listen on for logs.
- A Datadog API key with [Remote Configuration enabled][103].
- Your Datadog `Site URL`[104]. For example `datadoghq.com` for the site `US1`.
