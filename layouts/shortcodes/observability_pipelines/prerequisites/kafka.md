To use Observability Pipelines's Kafka source, you need the following information available:

- The hosts and ports of the Kafka bootstrap servers, which connects to the Kafka cluster and discovers all the other hosts in the cluster.
- The appropriate TLS certificates and the password you used to create your private key, if your forwarders are globally configured to enable SSL.
