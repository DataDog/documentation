To use Observability Pipelines's Splunk TCP source, you have a Splunk Enterprise or Cloud Instance alongside either a Splunk Universal Forwarder or a Splunk Heavy Forwarder routing data to your Splunk instance. You also have the following information available:
- The bind address that your Observability Pipelines Worker will listen on to receive logs from your applications. For example, `0.0.0.0:8088`.
- The appropriate [TLS certificates][101] and the password you used to create your private key if your forwarders are globally configured to enable SSL.

See [Deploy a Universal Forwarder][102] or [Deploy a Heavy Forwarder][103] for more information on Splunk forwarders.
