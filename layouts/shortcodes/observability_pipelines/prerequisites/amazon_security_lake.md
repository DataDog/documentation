1. Follow the [Getting Started with Amazon Security Lake][10071] to set up Amazon Security Lake, and make sure to:
    - Enable Amazon Security Lake for the AWS account.
    - Select the AWS regions where S3 buckets will be created for OCSF data.
1. Follow [Collecting data from custom sources in Security Lake][10072] to create a custom source in Amazon Security Lake.
    - When you [configure a custom log source in Security Lake in the AWS console][10073]:
        - Enter a source name.
        - Select the OCSF event class for the log source and type.
        - Enter the account details for the AWS account that will write logs to Amazon Security Lake:
            - AWS account ID
            - External ID
     - Select **Create and use a new service** for service access.
     - Take note of the name of the bucket that is created because you need it when you set up the Amazon Security Lake destination later on.
        - To find the bucket name, navigate to [Custom Sources][10074]. The bucket name is in the location for your custom source. For example, if the location is `s3://aws-security-data-lake-us-east-2-qjh9pr8hy/ext/op-api-activity-test`, the bucket name is `aws-security-data-lake-us-east-2-qjh9pr8hy`.
