1. Toggle the industry classifications you want to select rules for.
1. Select the library rules you want to use.
1. In the **Define rule target and action** section, select if you want to scan the **Entire Event**, **Specific Attributes**, or **Exclude Attributes** in the dropdown menu.
    - If you are scanning the entire event, you can optionally exclude specific attributes from getting scanned. Use [path notation](#path-notation-example-lib) (`outer_key.inner_key`) to access nested keys. For specified attributes with nested data, all nested data is excluded.
    - If you are scanning specific attributes, specify which attributes you want to scan. Use [path notation](#path-notation-example-lib) (`outer_key.inner_key`) to access nested keys. For specified attributes with nested data, all nested data is scanned.
1. For **Define actions on match**, select the action you want to take for the matched information. **Note**: Redaction, partial redaction, and hashing are all irreversible actions.
    - **Redact**: Replaces all matching values with the text you specify in the **Replacement text** field.
    - **Partially Redact**: Replaces a specified portion of all matched data. In the **Redact** section, specify the number of characters you want to redact and which part of the matched data to redact.
    - **Hash**: Replaces all matched data with a unique identifier. The UTF-8 bytes of the match are hashed with the 64-bit fingerprint of FarmHash.
1. Optionally, add tags you want to associate with the matched events.
1. Click **Add Rules**.

##### Path notation example {#path-notation-example-lib}

 For the following message structure, use `outer_key.inner_key.double_inner_key` to refer to the key with the value `double_inner_value`.
```json
{
    "outer_key": {
        "inner_key": "inner_value",
        "a": {
            "double_inner_key": "double_inner_value",
            "b": "b value"
        },
        "c": "c value"
    },
    "d": "d value"
}
```

##### Add additional keywords

After adding scanning rules from the library, you can edit each rule separately and add additional keywords to the keyword dictionary.

1. Navigate to your [pipeline][10141].
1. In the Sensitive Data Scanner processor with the rule you want to edit, click **Manage Scanning Rules**.
1. Toggle **Use recommended keywords** if you want the rule to use them. Otherwise, add your own keywords to the **Create keyword dictionary** field. You can also require that these keywords be within a specified number of characters of a match. By default, keywords must be within 30 characters before a matched value.
1. Click **Update**.
