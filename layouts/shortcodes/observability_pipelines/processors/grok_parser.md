This processor parses logs using the grok parsing rules that are available for a set of sources. The rules are automatically applied to logs based on the log source. Therefore, logs must have a `source` field with the source name. If this field is not added when the log is sent to the Observability Pipelines Worker, you can use the **Add field** processor to add it.

If the `source` field of a log matches one of the grok parsing rule sets, the log's `message` field is checked against those rules. If a rule matches, the resulting parsed data is added in the `message` field as a JSON object, overwriting the original `message`.

If there isn't a `source` field on the log, or no rule matches the log `message`, then no changes are made to the log and it is sent to the next step in the pipeline.


To set up the grok parser, define a **filter query**. Only logs that match the specified [filter query](#filter-query-syntax) are processed. All logs, regardless of whether they match the filter query, are sent to the next step in the pipeline.

To test log samples for out-of-the-box rules:
1. Click the **Preview Library Rules** button.
1. Search or select a source in the dropdown menu.
1. Enter a log sample to test the parsing rules for that source.

To add a custom parsing rule:

1. Click **Add Custom Rule**.
1. If you want to clone a library rule, select **Clone library rule** and then the library source from the dropdown menu.
1. If you want to create a custom rule, select **Custom** and then enter the `source`. The parsing rules are applied to logs with that `source`.
1. Enter log samples to test the parsing rules.
1. Enter the rules for parsing the logs. See [Parsing][10031] for more information on writing parsing rules.<br>**Note**: The `url`, `useragent`, and `csv` filters are not available.
1. Click **Advanced Settings** if you want to add helper rules. See [Using helper rules to factorize multiple parsing rules][10032] for more information.
1. Click **Add Rule**.
