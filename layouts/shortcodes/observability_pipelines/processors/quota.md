The quota processor measures the logging traffic for logs that match the filter you specify. When the configured daily quota is met inside the 24-hour rolling window, the processor can either drop additional logs or send an alert using a Datadog monitor. You can configure the processor to track the total volume or the total number of events.

As an example, you can configure this processor to drop new logs or trigger an alert without dropping logs after the processor has received 10 million events from a certain service in the last 24 hours.

To set up the quota processor:
1. Enter a name for the quota processor. The pipeline uses the name to identify the quota across multiple Remote Configuration deployments of the Worker.
1. Define a **filter query**. Only logs that match the specified [filter query](#filter-query-syntax) are counted towards the daily limit.
    - Logs that match the quota filter and are within the daily quota are sent to the next step in the pipeline.
    - Logs that do not match the quota filter are sent to the next step of the pipeline.
1. In the **Unit for quota** dropdown menu, select if you want to measure the quota by the number of `Events` or by the `Volume` in bytes.
1. Set the daily quota limit and select the unit of magnitude for your desired quota.
1. Check the **Drop events** checkbox if you want to drop all events when your quota is met. Leave it unchecked if you plan to set up a [monitor][5001] that sends an alert when the quota is met.
    - If logs that match the quota filter are received after the daily quota has been met and the **Drop events** option is selected, then those logs are dropped. In this case, only logs that did not match the filter query are sent to the next step in the pipeline.
    - If logs that match the quota filter are received after the daily quota has been met and the **Drop events** option is not selected, then those logs and the logs that did not match the filter query are sent to the next step in the pipeline.
1. Optional: Click **Add Field** if you want to set a quota on a specific service or region field.  
    a. Enter the field name you want to partition by. See the [Partition example](#partition-example) for more information.  
        i. Select the **Ignore when missing** if you want the quota applied only to events that match the partition. See the [Ignore when missing example](#example-for-the-ignore-when-missing-option) for more information.  
        ii. Optional: Click **Overrides** if you want to set different quotas for the partitioned field.  
        - Click **Download as CSV** for an example of how to structure the CSV.  
        - Drag and drop your overrides CSV to upload it. You can also click **Browse** to select the file to upload it. See the [Overrides example](#overrides-example) for more information.  
    b. Click **Add Field** if you want to add another partition.

#### Examples

##### Partition example

Use **Partition by** if you want to set a quota on a specific service or region. For example, if you want to set a quota for 10 events per day and group the events by the `service` field, enter `service` into the **Partition by** field.

##### Example for the "ignore when missing" option

Select **Ignore when missing** if you want the quota applied only to events that match the partition. For example, if the Worker receives the following set of events:

```
{"service":"a", "source":"foo", "message": "..."}
{"service":"b", "source":"bar", "message": "..."}
{"service":"b", "message": "..."}
{"source":"redis", "message": "..."}
{"message": "..."}
```

And the **Ignore when missing** is selected, then the Worker:
- creates a set for logs with `service:a` and `source:foo`
- creates a set for logs with `service:b` and `source:bar`
- ignores the last three events

The quota is applied to the two sets of logs and not to the last three events.

If the **Ignore when missing** is not selected, the quota is applied to all five events.

##### Overrides example

If you are partitioning by `service` and have two services: `a` and `b`, you can use overrides to apply different quotas for them. For example, if you want `service:a` to have a quota limit of 5,000 bytes and `service:b` to have a limit of 50 events, the override rules look like this:

| Service | Type   | Limit |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |
|  `a`    | Bytes  | 5,000 |
|  `b`    | Events | 50    |
