This processor samples your logging traffic for a representative subset at the rate that you define, dropping the remaining logs. As an example, you can use this processor to sample 20% of logs from a noisy non-critical service.

The sampling only applies to logs that match your filter query and does not impact other logs. If a log is dropped at this processor, none of the processors below receives that log.

To set up the sample processor:
1.  Define a **filter query**. Only logs that match the specified [filter query](#filter-query-syntax) are sampled at the specified retention rate below.
1. Set the **retain** field with your desired sampling rate expressed as a percentage. For example, entering `1` means 1% of logs is retained out of all the logs that match the filter query.
