There are pre-selected processors added to your processor group out of the box. You can add additional processors or delete any existing ones based on your processing needs.

Processor groups are executed from top to bottom, and the individual processors can be reordered with the drag handle on their top left corner. The order of the processors is important because logs pass through all processors in a group and are processed by each processor where the log a matches the filter query.
