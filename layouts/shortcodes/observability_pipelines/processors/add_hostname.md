This processor adds a field with the name of the host that sent the log. For example, `hostname: 613e197f3526`.

Define a **filter query**. Only logs that match the specified [filter query](#filter-query-syntax) are processed. All logs, regardless of whether they do or do not match the filter query, are sent to the next step in the pipeline.
