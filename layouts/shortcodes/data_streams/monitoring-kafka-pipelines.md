### Monitoring Kafka Pipelines
Data Streams Monitoring uses message headers to propagate context through Kafka streams. If `log.message.format.version` is set in the Kafka broker configuration, it must be set to `0.11.0.0` or higher. Data Streams Monitoring is not supported for versions lower than this.
