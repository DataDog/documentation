## Log archiving

Archiving logs to Azure Blob Storage requires an App Registration. If you haven't already, follow the [automatic][1000] or [manual][1001] setup instructions to configure the integration using an App Registration. App Registrations created for archiving purposes do not need the `Monitoring Reader` role.

After configuring an App Registration, [create a log archive][1002] that writes to Azure Blob Storage.

**Note**: If your storage bucket is in a subscription being monitored through the Azure Native integration, a redundancy warning appears in the Azure integration tile—this can be safely ignored for log archiving.
