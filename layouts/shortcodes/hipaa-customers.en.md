Datadog will sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with customers that transmit protected health information (ePHI) through Datadog's [HIPAA-eligible services][501].

These restrictions are imposed on customers who have signed Datadog's BAA:

* Users cannot request support through Zendesk Live Chat.
* Users cannot [share][502] logs or security signals from the Datadog explorer.
* Users cannot use third-party powered generative AI services other than LLM Observability.

If you have any questions about how the Log Management Service satisfies the applicable requirements under HIPAA, contact your account manager. HIPAA-enabled customers do not need to use specific endpoints to submit logs to enforce specific encryptions. The encryptions are enabled on all log submission endpoints.
