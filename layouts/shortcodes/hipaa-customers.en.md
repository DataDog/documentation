Datadog will sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with customers that transmit protected health information (ePHI) through Datadog's [HIPAA-eligible services][501].

These restrictions are imposed on customers who have signed Datadog's BAA:

* Users cannot request support through Zendesk Live Chat.
* Users cannot [share][502] logs or security signals from the Datadog explorer.
* Users cannot use third-party powered generative AI services.

If you have any questions about how the Log Management Service satisfies the applicable requirements under HIPAA, contact your account manager. HIPAA-enabled customers do not need to use specific endpoints to submit logs to enforce specific encryptions. The encryptions are enabled on all log submission endpoints.
