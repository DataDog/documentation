**Note: For AlwaysOn users, the Agent must be installed on a separate server and connected to the cluster through the listener endpoint**. This is because information about Availability Group (AG) secondary replicas is collected from the primary replica. Additionally, installing the Agent in this way helps to keep it up and running in the event of a failover.
