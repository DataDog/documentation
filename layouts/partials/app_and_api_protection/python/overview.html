<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) provides App and API Protection (AAP) capabilities including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Application Security Monitoring</strong>: Real-time threat detection and protection against attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and more</li>
  <li><strong>Software Composition Analysis (SCA)</strong>: Identification of vulnerable dependencies in your codebase</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)</strong>: Runtime vulnerability detection during testing</li>
</ul>

<p>ASM works by leveraging the Datadog Python tracing library to monitor HTTP requests, analyze patterns, and detect security threats in real-time. The library integrates seamlessly with your existing application without requiring code changes.</p>
