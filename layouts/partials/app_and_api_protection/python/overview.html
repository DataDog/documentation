<h3>Key capabilities</h3>

<h4>API discovery and posture management</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Automatically detect all APIs exposed by your services.</li>
  <li>Identify unprotected, undocumented, or overly permissive endpoints.</li>
  <li>Get detailed, contextual findings tied to specific endpoints, misconfigurations, and observed behavior.</li>
  <li>Evaluate API configurations against posture rules based on security best practices and compliance frameworks (e.g., OWASP API Top 10).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Runtime threat detection and protection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Detect real-time threats such as injection attacks, account takeover attempts, and application abuse.</li>
