# ===================================================================== #
# GLOBAL DEFAULTS AND OVERRIDES
# ===================================================================== #
# The builtin defaults can be changed globally by creating a $LIMA_HOME/_config/default.yaml
# file. It will be used by ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and it
# will be applied on each `limactl start`, so can affect instance restarts.

# A similar mechanism is $LIMA_HOME/_config/override.yaml, which will take
# precedence even over the settings in an instances lima.yaml file.
# It too applies to ALL instances under the same $LIMA_HOME, and is applied
# on each restart. It can be used to globally override settings, e.g. make
# the mount of the home directory writable.

# On each instance start the config settings are determined: If a value is
# not set in `lima.yaml`, then the `default.yaml` is used. If that file
# doesn't exist, or the value is not defined in the file, then the builtin
# default is used. If `override.yaml` exists and defines the value, then
# it overrides whatever has been chosen so far.

# For slices (e.g. `mounts`, `provision`) and maps (`env`) the entries are
# combined instead of replacing each other. Slices are produced from override
# settings, followed by lima.yaml, followed by default.yaml (but NOT from
# builtin defaults). Maps are produced starting with default.yaml values,
# overwriting with lima.yaml ones, overwriting with override.yaml.

# Exceptions:
# - `dns` will use the list from the highest priority file; they are not
#   combined. If override.yaml defines a list of `dns` entries, then the
#   settings in default.yaml and lima.yaml are ignored.
#
# - `mounts` will update the `writable` setting when 2 entries have the
#   same `location` value. For this reason they are processed in the opposite
#   order: starting with default, followed by lima, and then override.
#
# -`networks` will replace lower priority entries with the same `interface`
#   name with higher priority definitions. This does not apply if the
#  `interface` field is empty. `networks` are therefore also processed
#  in lowest to highest priority order.
